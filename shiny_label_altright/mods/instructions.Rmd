# Welcome to Our Alt Right Coding Project

Let us first thank you personally for participating in our Alt Right Coding Project. It's great that you are taking the time to do this and we really appreciate it. Without your help, this project would not be possible in this way. Please feel free to contact us at any time if you have any questions.

# What is the Goal of this Project?

The goal of this project will be to track the Alt Right on various Social Media platforms (Facebook, Twitter and YouTube). We seek to identify their content, their talking points and their narratives by applying machine learning algorithms. In order to do this we accumalted a dataset of over 15 Million comments and tweets from Social Media accounts that are associated with the Alt Right. Ultimately, we hope to make this dataset publicly available (in an anonomized form), so that other researchers might be able to pursue their own research questions. The findings of this project will be presented at a [Voxpol Online-Extremism workshop at the University of Oxford](http://www.voxpol.eu/events/combating-online-extremism-state-private-sector-civil-society-responses-call-papers/).

# How can you help?

We expect you to code 500 comments/tweets that come from a wide variety of Social Media Accounts that are associated with the Alt Right. We included several scales that will be used to classify the commentary. We also hope to differentiate between the so-called "Alt-Light" and "Alt-Right". The following section includes the instructions on how to code, please feel free to reference those whenever you have trouble.

# Instructions and Coding Guidelines

## **1. Type of Language**

### *Vulgar Language*
 
Please classify anything as *Vulgar Language* that uses swearwords, personal insults or cursing.

**Example:** *Get the fuck outta here talking bout the response will be better. You fucking ignorant stupid asshole.*
  
### *Hostile Language*
 
Please classify anything as *Hostile Language* that makes derorigatory remarks about an entire group of people based on their race, religion and/or gender. This includes stereotypes, humiliation, discrimination, race-, religion-, and/or gender-based insults.

**Example:** *Because mudslimes are mudslimes for a reason. When you let mudslimes into your country, your people are going to spend the rest of their days getting raped and beheaded.*
  

### *Call for Violence*

Please classify anything as a *Call for (Physical) Violence* that includes a call to acting out violence against a certain group of people based on their race, religion and/or gender. This includes endorsing to kill or injure, mass deport, forcefully evict and/or segregate them.

**Example:** *Deport all illegal immigrants or kill them if they resist this is literally the law.*
  
## **2. Irony**

Is the person being ironic? Can the comment be reasonably interpreted as ironic? For example, does it look like it would mock someone's opinion rather than express one itself?

**Example:** *A white ethnostate would be a great idea. Nobody will ever suffer any problems whatsoever then, I am sure of that.*

## **3. Ideological Stances**

In this chapter we want you to rate the presence of certain Alt Right attitude. Please classify anything as *"Not present"* if there is no indication of that attitude and classify anything as *"Strongly present*"* if the text endorses a particularly vile/strong version of that attitude. Use the number 2 - 3 to indicate states inbetween these two endpoints.

### *Anti-Left/Liberal Sentiment*
 
Please classify anything as a *Anti-Left/Liberal Sentiment* that includes a strong sentiment against liberals or "the Left" as a whole. This would include but is not limited to the idea that liberals/leftists:

+ want to propagate *political correctness*, 
+ want to *censor/silence* everyone they disagree with,
+ undermine national unity or "western values"" (sometimes called "cultural marxism"), 
+ are Social Justice Warriors (SJWs) and/or snowflakes

The more intense and salient the text refers to these tropes, the higher the score should be.

**Example for Strongly present:** *Liberal SJWs wants to censor or shut down anyone who oppose them. Insecure, whiney, narcissist snowflakes who have been given a position that allow them too much manipulation of many. Fuck Censorship. Fuck Political Correctness. Fuck Cultural Marxism.*	
 
### *Focus on White Identity*
 
Please classify anything as a *Focus on White Identity* focuses on a collective white identity/race. This could include expressing a wish about living in a white-majority country or "white ethnostate" and/or attributing achievements of historic Europeans to white people in general.

The more intense and salient the text refers to these tropes, the higher the score should be.

**Example for Strongly present:** *Im sorry to say.. This is going to sound extremely racist, but without all the white influence in this world back then, if there were never white people, this whole world would suck and be uncivilized. The world is a better place when there are white ethnostates.*	
  
### *Misogyny and Anti-Feminism*
 
Please classify anything as *Misogyny and Anti-Feminism* that expresses hatred, dislike, or mistrust of women, or prejudice against women. This includes expressing patriarchal and male-dominated notions of gender relations and seeing the advocacy for women's rights and Feminism as unnecessary/bad for society/women themselves.

**Example for Strongly present:** *Feminism will push women away from men.. the idea that women don't need men is completely idiotic and dangerous. Patriarchy has always existed and will always exist and that's a good thing.*	
 
### *Racism*
 
Please classify anything as *Racism* that expresses hatred, dislike, or mistrust of people of other races, or prejudice against them. This includes expressing the belief in the notion that humans may be divided into separate and exclusive biological entities called “races”; that there is a causal link between inherited physical traits and traits of personality, intellect, morality, and other cultural and behavioral features; and that some races are innately superior to others (also called *race realism*).

This comes often with the idea that people from "3rd world countries have low IQ" that makes them "biologically more inclined" to commit violence, which makes it more desirable to either limit non-white immigration, establish "white ethnostates" or enforce segregation by race.

**Example for Strongly present:** *All blacks do benefit from the constant threat of theft and murder that keeps other races paranoid, wary, and untrusting and I don't even judge them because it is their biological makeup that makes them do this. This absolutely DOES justify segregation.*	
 
### *Anti-Semitism*
 
Please classify anything as *Anti-Semitism* that expresses hatred, dislike, or mistrust of people of Jewish, or prejudice against them. This includes expressing belief in anti-Jewish conspiracy theories, for example that Jewish people want to "undermine white identity" through advocating liberal and progressive ideals and notions that they want to eliminate white people through mass immigration and inbreeding ("white genocide"). 

This comes often with the idea that Jewish people as a whole control the media, the government, the banks and other positions of power. Tropes to look out for are three parentheses "((( )))" around a name to indicate that they are Jewish or to refer to the Holocaust as "holohoax" and mock the victim count by stating that "six gorillion people died". A dog-whistle that often means Jewish people is to refer to them as "globalists".

**Example for Strongly present:** *(((Pro refugee groups))) are the ones demanding for white countries to have open borders and how 'racist' and 'bigoted' whites are for wanting their own country. Meanwhile they control the banks, the government and the media and want to makes us think it ain't so. I won't be guilt tripped by any holoxaux fake story anymore.*	
 
### *Anti-Elite/Establishment Sentiment and Conspiracy Theories*
 
Please classify anything as *Anti-Elite/Establishment Sentiment and Conspiracy Theories* that expresses animosities towards a ruling class (a person or class of persons considered superior by others or by themselves, as in intellect, talent, power, wealth, or position in society). This also includes ideas about conspiracies such as the "9/11 was an Inside Job" trope or believing that all of Mainstream Media is "Fake News".

**Example for Strongly present:** *This is just more establishment elitism, what if we simply don't accept the mainstream media FAKE NEWS lies no more and disregard whatever these fine uppity men and women want to tell us. The Trump collussion story is just as fake as 9/11 and any other false flag attack trying to make us all become behaved little sheeple.*
