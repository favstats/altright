Title: November 9, 2016
Date: 2016-12-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=234pjzmocbo
Description: On November 8th, 2016, America arrived at a fork in the road: turn Left, and America would become a majority non-white nation, with everything that entails � turn Right, and perhaps America could be saved by halting white demographic replacement. All we needed was a Republican who had the vision to see the problem, the courage to do something about it, and the political skill to get into the White House. In short, we needed a miracle. Only a god could save us. Or a God Emperor.

Title: The Relevance of the Old Right

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=cVoElAuWviM
Description: What is the relevance of what I call the Old Right � German National Socialism, Italian Fascism, and related interwar national-populist movements � to White Nationalism today? The question would not even arise, of course, if there were no connection at all. Many White Nationalist ideas are either direct descendants of Old Right ideologies, or they are their cousins, meaning that they share common ancestors, that they are branches of the same ideological tree.

Title: G?ration Identitaire, Camp Identitaire, 2012 (English Subtitles)
Date: 2013-01-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=tbp2udNhOnU
Description: The French G?ration Identitaire Camp was held in Orleans from the 12th to the 18th of August 2012. It had 70 participants and was the 10th summer camp held by the group.

For the first time conferences and workshops were exclusively staffed by cadres and activists who had attended previous camps. 

This was also the first camp to take place under a socialist government in France, and as such received more negative media attention than in the past. But while dozens of policemen were assigned to monitor and harass camp participants, their diversion made it possible for protesters to burn the boxing club and tobacco bar in the nearby town of Gien.
