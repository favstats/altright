Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 169 – Welcome to the current Year+3
Date: 2018-01-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=aLXjsuFKtZ0
Description: On December 5, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last month, covering the last period of 2017 and early 2018.

2018 Anno Domini (or Current Year+3 Anno Trudeau) starts with stunning revelations regarding how sexual offences charges are being dealt with in the United Kingdom. AVfM's friend and partner Mike Buchanan of J4MB warned on this show years ago that the appointment of Alison Saunders as director of Public Prosecutions will have severe negative impact on innocent men. Now we're learning just to what extent this impact is.

In other news, also from the UK, there is a new regulator in town tasked to fine universities who infringe upon students' rights to freedom of expression. Meanwhile, in Ireland, two straight men used the gay marriage privilege to avoid paying inheritance taxes.

In other news, the "experts" at WHO... who also brought us the gender bending insanity... now tell us that playing games is a "mental disorder". Striving to chop off your son's penis is apparently still not a mental disorder.

And in other... other news, Iceland "bans" paying women less. No, really. And in Norway a female pedophile's defense in court is that some bad man taught her. Conveniently, the bad man is dead and can't defend his name.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 168 – The current year ends tumultuously

On December 8, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last two weeks.

Kissing under mistletoe might be rape. At least according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland that joined the other police services in the United Kingdom who have acted throughout the current year as the killjoys-in-chiefs for all things nice in life.

In other news, 'gender-based insults' are to become an offense in France in a move that is likely to not go down that well in the country of romance and flirting. In other news, a Swiss political party would like to see the Western law abolished when it comes to claims of sexual assault and reverse the burden of proof. Meanwhile in Denmark, the authorities appear to prefer to see children living in jail alongside their criminal mothers instead of considering that maybe, just maybe, fathers are parents too.

In other, other news, the Romanian government wants to compel companies that employ more than 50 people to have a "equal opportunity technician" on their payroll.

These and other news will be discussed tonight.

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 167 – The puncturing of the bubble
Date: 2017-11-24

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 167 – The puncturing of the bubble

On November 24, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last two weeks.

Most feminists (particularly in the Academia and militant activist groups of feminists) and most gender ideologues in general have been living in a minuscule bubble completely unaware of the utter wrongness of their ideas. The few of them who did make some contact with the outside world (perhaps even be exposed a bit to the ideas of the wide non-feminist majority) withdrew right back into the safe space claiming everyone else is a misogynist or a rapist.

However, perhaps for the first time since the success of Feminists' long march through institutions, they have started lately to notice that something has changed. They still don't know what or why - but the questions abound.
So researchers at a British university have just figured out that men are men and women are women and continue to function like they've been functioning since forever. And continue to be attracted by the opposite sex based on roughly the same characteristics since forever.

In other news, "gender researchers" in Sweden have just figured out that essentially nobody outside their minuscule militant bubble believes them anymore or even gives them the benefit of the doubt.

In other, other news, the questioning of circumcision in Europe continues - this time with Muslims publicly questioning it why it happens. This is a culturally relevant moment and will explain why. Also, don't refer to female pupils as 'girls' because that's somehow wrong. We don't know why - but a gender ideologue says so, therefore it must be true.

These and other news will be discussed tonight.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/11/21/do-not-refer-female-pupils-girls-ladies-reminds-gender-head/#

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 166 – Question ALL of #MeToo

On November 10, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last week.

In the first segment of the show, we’ll have Mike Buchanan on air (if we can make the feed work, lol) to talk about the ICMI18 and also the initial media coverage of the Birmingham conference.

The #MeToo saga is starting to have the opposite of its intended effect. More and more figures – big and small – are starting to question the militant misandrism behind it. So much so that a Dutch company is launching a reality TV show based on questioning rape stories.

In other news, Germany is to recognize a third ‘gender’ and the Cathedral Media discovered (again) that rape as a weapon of war is a thing – especially against men.

These and other news will be discussed tonight.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 165 – This hysteria is different

On November 3, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last two weeks.

Unlike previous sexual harassment and assault hysterias, this time is different. This time, perhaps for the first time in history (and certainly among the few times in history) – there is a serious and consistent pushback.

The snowball embodied by the #metoo campaign is meeting significant resistance – the kind of resistance that was quite hard to imagine less than a decade ago – up to Swedish members of Parliament speaking against it.

In other news, the British Feminist establishment is at it again trying to cancel the upcoming ICMI18 because Feminists (like most people, really) learn one thing from history: the fact that feminists learn nothing from history.

These and other news will be discussed tonight.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 164 – Our long march through institutions

On October 20, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last three weeks

The biggest news in European politics this month has to be the Catalan referendum - and, given that the referendum was pushed by the far-far-Left, it wouldn't have been a complete communist campaign without some feminist nonsense in it.

In other news, the Norwegian police just learned that girls are human and, as such, can be, and indeed are, quite frequently, violent criminals too. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, a bitter and precedent-setting legal battle is taking place over the paternity of what the State alleges to be an "anchor-baby" of a Kosovar mother.

In more recurring news, the establishment is freaked out over the fact that the MRAs might start their own march through institutions starting with the Sillicon Valley. At the Voice of Europe, we'll provide ways on how to do just that!

These and other news will be discussed tonight.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4985386/Men-fined-spot-wolf-whistling-women.html

Undoubtedly the biggest news-that-is-not-really-news is the re-re-reelection of Angela Merkel as German Chancellor. However, this comes with some challenges that those in the Cathedral didn't expect. So we'll discuss those.

Afterwards, the news tonight is split into three categories - science&nonsense, justice and, as usual, the silly place. In science, the Belgian Ethics Committee ruled that the genital mutilation of infants is unethical. In other news, studying people who've decided on their own skin that "gender transition" is not the brightest idea is now verbotten in Universities thanks to the incredibly strong transgenderist lobby.

In other news, there is a strong problem with dog Patriarchy in Sweden. No, really. This is what the bien-pensants in Södermalm are busy with. Södermalm is the place where the Feminist Initiative party gets 40% at the polls.

These and other news will be discussed tonight.

Description: On August 11, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last week.

The Google saga is by far the most important piece of (developing) news of the week. How will this story go down will influence the culture on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond. So we'll dedicate quite a lengthy segment on it.

In other news, the Berlin Senate wants urinals for women. Also in Austria, apparently old women are willing to pay good money for sex with newly immigrant men in a story that authorities suspect sexual abuse by women might also occur. Meanwhile, in Iraq, a German young woman who has been working for the Islamic State has been arrested - and for some reason most people pretend she's supposed to be exempted from the normal treatment reserved to traitors and terrorists.

These and other news will be discussed tonight.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: On August 4, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last week.

In the dispute between Feminism and the Free Market, one should always bet on the latter. Swedish feminists have learned this the hard way when it emerged that the CEO of the Dollar Store - whom feminists vowed to boycott and put out of business because he expressed disdain and mockery to anything feminist - just announced that his store network experienced a 30% growth compared to last year's similar period. If only someone would let Tesco know that not-pandering to feminists is not a tragedy.

In other news, two studies have revealed that women are people. And, as such, they are indeed capable of rape and, like the other half of people, they don't in fact struggle more than men to juggle work and family life - even though they might complain more.

These and other news will be discussed tonight.

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 159 – The BBC Saga

On July 28, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last week.

By far the most important piece of news in sexual politics in the last 10 days or so is the manure-storm triggered by the BBC's release of its "top talent" salary figures. The numbers themselves revealed nothing surprising - for normal people, that is. For feminists, the revelations were 'shocking' and as a result launched in a crusade to prove what normal people have been sensing for years now: That the BBC is at the mercy of feminists - in spite of claims to the contrary.

In other news, the Supreme Court of Israel has just agreed that there is no reason whatsoever for women to be spared from paying child support; and the two biggest cities in the Netherlands - Rotterdam and Amsterdam - are adopting some deeply misguided 'sexual harassment' policies carrying huge fines.

These and other news will be discussed tonight.

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 158 – Questioning the received wisdoms

On July 21, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last two weeks.

When we started doing this show - ideas such as vaccinating boys against HPV or the idea that there is an inherent pussy pass, or even the idea that some so-called "sex crimes" aren't really sex crimes (like a 17 year old taking a naked picture of himself or his 17 year old girlfriend) - these ideas were some tiny radical fringe. Now they're on the front page of the BBC and other mainstream outlets.

In Norway, such double standards have either been eliminated already (Norway has a full HPV vaccination programme for all) or are publicly questioned. Meanwhile, in Sweden, the Discrimination Ombudsman ruled that sex-segregated classes at a private Islamic school are "not discrimination". The question is if this applies to everyone or just for the Religion of Special needs. Because there is a case to be made for single sex education.

Speaking of Islam, there's a new book out there on how to have halal sex - for women. Apparently, women in Islam are so oppressed that books are written for them. Now here's a received wisdom that needs more questioning.

In other news, the "muh pay gap in football" whining reached Germany. Apparently, the fact that Mrs. Nobody KnowsHer makes less than Bastian Schweinsteiger is somehow bad.

These and other news will be discussed tonight.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 157 –

On July 7, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last week.

Water is wet. And women are a significant portion of "honour-based" abuse. It's not like the MRM has been warning about this for years or anything. But it matters only when it affects girls. Speaking of which, some academicians have started to worry about boys' and men's educational prospects. Also because it affects girls. You see... women's hypergamous behavior is affected as they don't have enough "highly educated" (whatever that means) men to get married with.

In other news, MGM (Male Genital Mutilation) is not only culturally but legally challenged these days in the United Kingdom. Again - because a woman complained. It didn't quite matter when a plethora of men complained. But still - it's a positive development.
Meanwhile, in Norway, moms who kidnap the children from their fathers are starting to actually be punished. And in France the Ethics Committee (!) decided that purposefully conceiving children to grow up fatherless is... ethical.
These and other news will be discussed tonight.

Description: On June 23, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last week.

The far-Left feminist dominated capitals of Europe (such as Berlin and Madrid) continue with their long march towards their attempt to implement the most insane policies that may make the activists feel good but, in the end, don't really help anyone. In the meantime, even 14 year old children figure it out quite fast that this whole thing is insane. And not only they're figuring it out, but even the mainstream media is starting to publish them.

In other news, the corridor of opinion in Sweden has widened enough that it is now acceptable to speak in public about the troubles of the long march through institutions.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Lucian is in Sweden these days so, naturally, Sweden will get a bit more focus than usual. But, since the previous episode – other things have happened too. Philip Davies (speaker at last year’s ICMI) has retained his seat following the snap elections that took place in Britain. And the feminist tears were delightful – especially since they first thought that Davies had lost.

In other news, Sadhiq Khan’s food department has concluded that feminism is to be blamed for obesity. Now this will be hard to spin by feminists. Meanwhile, in Sweden, the most feminist country in Europe – the total number of women suffering from FGM has continuously risen in the last several years (while the number of victims of MGM has remained constant). Speaking about this is harder though since this is considered “racist” in Sweden and, as a study shows, the majority of Swedes favor censorship of “racist” messages.

In other other news, the American stupidity of “manspreading” has finally seeped into some policy. Madrid banned “manspreading”. On a more positive note, Switzerland may change its legal definition for rape to also include men. These, and other news will be covered in detail tonight.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Is it time for men’s issues to break into the political mainstream? With all major parties in the upcoming UK election wooing the female vote, it might be an opportune moment for some product differentiation through addressing men’s issues. One such issue is suicide, which is the number one cause of death for young men in the UK. Men such as Jay Cheshire, a 17-year-old who killed himself after being falsely accused of rape.

In other news, Swedish feminists continue to try to turn Twitter into a safe space by blocking such vile people as PewDiePie, the mayor of Paris seeks to ban a feminist festival for racist discrimination, and female students at a Belgian university have to suffer under the tribulation of getting fashion advice from their school.

Being of 'extraordinary talent' might also be enough to get legal license to kill. If you are a woman and in Great Britain, that is. In a rush to remain 'anti-racist', a region in Sweden will continue to subsidize the genital mutilation of boys. Scrapping that would be racist say the bien-pensants of most of Europe. Even so, a political party in Norway still thinks it's the right thing to do and now Fremskrittspartiet is the target of the aforementioned bien-pensants.

In other news, some women being lesbian might be the fault of men. We think the fact that it rained in some areas of Europe in the last few days is also the fault of men, but that's another story.

And, finally, the Dutch feminist establishment is united in trying to take down the one website that mocks their demented ideology. GreenStijl stood in firm opposition for far too long.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 152– Intersectional religion

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 152– Intersectional religion

On May 8, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last week.

In this show we'll allot an unusually high amount of time to religion - but we'll be ecumenical about it. The religion of feminist intersectionality and the religion of Islam will get roughly equal coverage as they... intersected with each other quite a lot in the last week.

The far Left president of Austria suggested that he might require all women to wear a hijab because, you see, it's every woman's right to wear what she wants. Unless the government decides to combat 'Islamophobia' by forcing them to wear what the government wants them to. Seems legit.

In other news, a Norwegian feminist argues that it's great for 7 year olds to watch porn. This would be in the country where 7 year olds can't legally sign a document but can legally change their sex. Meanwhile, in Germany, there's a serious concern that the tax form is not female-friendly so filing taxes is thus inherently patriarchal.

And, finally, breastfeeding is natural. Well, we might have to apologize for saying that because a study has shown that pointing out such reality is unethical because... well... because it offends feminists or whatever.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 151– Practical politics

On April 28, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last two weeks.

Back in the days of the Soviet Union, the State was using weaponized science to conduct social engineering. That’s how anyone disagreeing with the state ideology (such as by poking fun at it) could be deemed medically insane. In the current year, those who poke fun at the sacred cows of the current state ideology can also be deemed as having mental problems. Because we all “know” it can’t be the ideology that’s cancer.

In other news, being a teacher while being a man is a risky proposition. So risky in fact that the men who “made it” are advising the others not to bother. Unless you want to be in jail because a girl lied. In fact, being a man is enough to get to jail if a woman lies about you – as a gay man recently learned in Spain a few days ago. In other news, the Feminist Party is trying to challenge Philip Davies in the Shipley constituency in the upcoming UK general elections.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 150– Feminist urban planning

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MljuaI_s1cA
Description: On April 14, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last week.

Earlier this month, the press reported that feminists are fleeing one of the many Islamic no-go zones of Stockholm. But the progressive-feminist authorities of the greater Stockholm area have the solution: Feminist urban planning. No, this is not a joke.

In other news, the Supreme Court in the UK just grabbed some more power from the families and handed it to the State and the Islamic no-go country inside the Russian Federation - the Chechen Republic, that is - just commenced a large crackdown on gay men because... well... because that's what Islamic dictatorships tend to do. Though it must be said that the English-language press misreported some details.

Description: On April 7, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last week.

When we started this show, the idea of men actively talking back in the mainstream against misandrist assumptions (such as the wariness of members of the public when a dad is alone with his minor child) was a pipe dream. Also, when we started this show, it was a mainstream idea to oppose male contraceptive pills.

Many formerly mainstream positions have been marginalized in favor of more sensible positions - and we're now in the middle of the transition period - when the old mainstream still tries to push ahead and the new mainstream pushes back much more vigorously.

The prospect of highly realistic sex dolls has been in the headlines for several years now - but things are rapidly progressing. To the point that human hookers are complaining over unfair competition. Yes, really.
In other news, if you're a man and you enjoy giving your girlfriend an orgasm, you're a sexist. It says so on Cosmo, so it must be true.

Description: On March 17, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last two weeks.

March 8 came and went and it was barely noticed. It would appear that the feminists spent most of their agitation capital on the silly January 21st global march and simply did not have enough juice for March 8. Remarkably low-energy protests both in Europe and North America (not to mention numerically inferiour to the January 21st ones).

In this episode, we continue to document the "two-speed" state of our world. On one hand the legacy feminist state continues to march as if nothing happened in the culture and, on the other hand, the rest of the culture moves on while sneering at feminism in particular and political correctness overall. The two trends are approaching collision point.

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 144 – Appreciating the progress in culture

On February 24, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last two weeks.

In this episode, most of the news items will be covered with the view of how things changed, culturally speaking. Many of the news items in this episode aren't exactly "news" for the veterans in the politically activated non-feminist sector but they are news for the rest of the world.

Less than 5 years ago it was unimaginable to see in a mainstream source to talk about the dangers of false allegations. Let alone a pop-culture figure. Now it's becoming increasingly acceptable - which is great.

In other news, the progressive double standards are now also in full display. What was in 2012 mere discussions on obscure forums is now mainstream talk with regards to sex-based affirmative action - as can be seen with the examples of the Sydney University and the Bergen University, the latter case being covered in this episode.

Description: On February 3, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last week.

As the advancement of the counter-culture (the non-feminist thought being part of that) continues, feminism's internal problems with most women start becoming a lot more mainstream. In Sweden, for instance, two feminists asserted on national TV that midwifes (women themselves) who don't want to perform abortions should be "retroactively aborted".

Meanwhile, feminists are also at odds with practices such as hijab-wearing in public as Austria seeks to restrict this practice, following the example of France and Bulgaria. In other news, calling women "expectant mothers" might soon be a thing of the past since the phrase is "offensive" according to our progressive moral superiours.

These, and other news will be discussed thoroughly in tonight’s episode.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 142 – The war on normal youth behavior?
Date: 2017-01-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6eg-J7wVSrM
Description: On January 27, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent in the last week.

The current year is likely to be one with conflicts that we couldn't even imagine almost four years ago when we started The Voice of Europe. It was a running joke in 2013 that you could be penalized for rolling your eyes at feminist idiocy - but now it's about to become reality in an Austrian university.

Meanwhile, a bunch of Norwegian "researchers" concluded that it's the tests' fault for revealing that boys are better at math and girls are better at reading. It couldn't possibly be biology and/or natural inclinations. That would be heresy, for sure. Speaking of Norwegian affairs, the judiciary in Norway is not satisfied with the jury system it's been trying for a while because in rape cases it lacks the proper (read: feminist) lens.

These, and other news will be discussed thoroughly in tonight’s episode.

So the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: On January 20, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent covering the end of the previous current year and the first weeks of the current year.

As the current year sets in, stats are starting to come out about all sorts of things that happened in 2016 - such as modifications in the economy, increase or decrease in incidence in various diseases and so on and so forth. One example is that Swedish men are increasingly getting themselves infected with antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea.

In other news, the Feminists have acquired God-like power since they seem to know what's in Milo Yiannopoulos' next book even though the book is not yet written, let alone published. Back in Scandinavia, feminists in Denmark are planning to... march against Donald Trump. Because... actually we don't know yet why. But they will.

These, and other news will be discussed thoroughly in tonight’s episode.

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 140 – Merry Christmas

On December 23, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news concerning sexual politics on the Old Continent.

As we approach the end of the current year, 2016 is the year that keeps on delivering.

British Anti-Feminist MP and ICMI16 speaker Philip Davies was voted to be in the House of Commons "Women and equalities committee" much to the dismay of Feminists and also several purple poodles who pretend to work for men's rights. Also Philip Davies took a sound stance against the misandrist Istanbul Convention that may indeed still pass in Britain, though with much more opposition than in other places.

Meanwhile, after Norway, Serbia becomes the second country in Europe to extend the HPV vaccination programme to boys. Free speech in general (and thus non-establishmentarian views such as the belief that women are adults) might take a severe blow in Germany as the State moves from being cozy to being hostile with Facebook which it now threatens with steep fines if the social network doesn't censor fast enough whatever the establishment deems objectionable.

These, and other news will be discussed thoroughly în tonight’s episode.

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 139 – The perpetual silly place
Date: 2016-12-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=b5t1m5k8NHM
Description: On December 9, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news of the latest insanities on the Old Continent.

As part of Feminism’s process of going out of fashion, and its activists’ instinct to double down at any sign of pushback – the amount of news from “the silly place” that the Feminist establishment is delivering to us increases by the week. Although we strive to offer a serious show with every episode, these last two weeks have provided more news from the silly place than ever.

Spain, with an unemployment rate that should be unacceptable in the current global trends, is largely busy with quotas for naming streets after women. And since a hardline feminist-communist party won the local elections in many big Spanish cities… this is the priority. Meanwhile, in France, the Socialist majority in the National Assembly wants to outright censor those who argue that abortion happening so often and used as a contraceptive method is not the best idea possible. Stockholm tries again to ban “sexist advertising” (a phrase that should be read in the most Islamic/Feminist way possible) and another Swedish party joined the effort to try to punish those who dare to use their freedom of movement to travel to Denmark and purchase the services of Danish sex workers.

These, and other news will be discussed thoroughly în tonight’s episode.

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: On November 25, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian V?an and James Huff, will be going through the news of the latest insanities on the Old Continent.

As Feminism is finally starting to slowly go out of fashion - in no small part thanks to its ridiculous excesses - there now comes the time to deal with the mess. Three German young women tried to kill a man because one of them lied that that man had raped them. In Sweden, the judiciary is cracking down on false rape allegations. There is an entire generation out there raised in the listen-and-believe spirit - and that's the kind of mess normal people will have to clean up going forward once ideological feminism will have faded away.

Speaking of Sweden, the mansplaining hotline didn't quite go as planned. In other news, internet freedom in the United Kingdom is about to take two big blows - one in terms of surveillance and one in terms of censorship.

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

A remarkably slow news week in Europe. A Swedish union opens a "mansplaining" hotline for women to whine when they're argued with at the office, the Dutch Science academy institutionalizes its existent misandric practices and some feminists just simply cannot cope with the fact that International Men's Day is now the law in more and more places regardless of their feelings.

It would be insane for us not to talk on Voice of Europe about the last three days as it dawns on the feminist sector that the new president of the USA is not the candidate who believes women are the primary victims of war but the candidate that believes "us [men] get a raw deal".

Rivers of feminist tears have been flowing allover the place on both sides of the Atlantic as doom and gloom became the rhetorical norm on the feminist sector of the society. In other news, the Swedish feminist sector is also crying as the feminist policy on snow plowing... well... doesn't work.

These and other stories will be discussed at length in tonight's episode.

ABR stands for Always Be Recording. The male employees in Norwegian kindergartens are requiring complete video surveillance at the workplace in order to stay clear of the looming threat of false allegations of child molestation - a threat wildly exacerbated by the general(ized) misandrist climate of the workplace, no doubt.

In any event, news are moderately good this week as the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, endorses the upcoming International Men's Day - and in so doing becoming the first British PM to do so since the founding of the event. Romanian feminists are having a bad week as the Eurostat report just announced that the country has virtually no pay gap whatsoever even though they had just complained about the lack of female-favoring legislation and affirmative action programs in the economy to allegedly redress the alleged imbalance.

These and other stories will be discussed at length in tonight's episode.

The last few weeks have been very interesting in Europe. On one hand, Icelandic feminists have convinced women to protest in the streets against the 14% "gender pay gap" (as if it's something that can be dealt with via protests). On the other hand, Spain adopted saner policies with regards to custody of the children after divorce.

Meanwhile, Swedish taxpayers pay for "gender researchers" to create a female-friendly truck and a British family court stands up to the extremism of the "transgender equality" ideology.

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 132 – Women's perceived feelings trumps everything

On October 7, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news of the latest insanities on the Old Continent.

It would seem that "what would women think?" is a much more important question than anything else these days. This is definitely true in the Swedish Parliament where the removal of a classical artwork was decided because it offends certain women. It is also the case at the BBC which started firing its male stars (particularly the White ones) in a bid to replace them with as many women as possible.

In other news, a cancer-related children's charity in Norway is refusing a big donation cheque because one of the donors insulted a woman on the internet. No joke.

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 130 – Never enough government with Feminists

On September 30, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the news of the latest insanities on the Old Continent.

Sustained nonsense in terms of sexual politics is being pushed these days through the German public institutions. Apparently, women's voluntary choices don't fit enough with the mandatory feminist-inspired equality-of-outcome so more needs to be done by the Government. In Sweden, kindergartens are following the proven inefficient corporate model of "open space" but they're also extending it to creepy levels - such as transparent doors in the bathrooms to prevent sexual assault.

Also, a globalist agitprop institution, masquerading as a charity, is pushing via the UN a narrative that the governments need to control everyone's lives more because women allegedly do more "work" during their lifetimes than men.

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: On September 16, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be back discussing the latest news on the Old Continent.

The British media produced a disproportionate amount of news in the last week - hence the UK focus of tonight’s episode.

Perhaps one of the reasons this occurred is because the World Suicide Prevention day happened and, for some reason, the British media decided to dissent from the normative trend of the continental media and actually treat this more seriously than the standard lipservice paid by the media in other languages (except the Swedish media which didn’t even notice the event).

In other news, the pro-mutilation lobby in Norway has scored its first victory after a series of defeats in its struggle to maintain the genital mutilation of boys (and only of boys) legal and practiced in the Kingdom.

Anyway, so the news discussed tonight are as follows:

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/gay-couples-babies-men-give-birth-discovery-breakthrough-new-technique-fertilisation-no-mother-a7249066.html

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 129 – Honest Feminists

On September 9, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be back discussing the latest news on the Old Continent.

Slowly, but surely, open discussion about false rape allegations is getting more and more common in Europe - even as the choir of honest feminists shouts harder that such events don’t happen. An honest feminist is exactly what one expects from a feminist: angry, man-hating, totalitarian, supremacist and open about being so - and we’ll be talking a lot about these kinds of people this week.

In other news, the Romanian defense ministry responded to feminist-inspired complaints by removing women’s places altogether. In other-other news, the president of Britain’s largest opposition party is upset about after-work drinking being sexist. And in other news, the Italian supreme court relaxed the country’s law regarding masturbation in public.

Anyway, so the news discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 128 – Major policy changes incoming

On September 2, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be back discussing the latest news on the Old Continent.

Sweden is preparing to bring back mandatory conscription and in Germany a new law is pending meant to prevent women from concealing their acts of cuckoldry and milk the State and innocent men as a result of that concealment. These are the big headlines these days in Europe’s sexual politics.

In other news, women are getting progressively unhappier whilst men’s happiness levels remain stagnant over the decades. This is sometimes framed as a joke but the pile of evidence is getting bigger by the day. And we’ll comment a lot on this aspect.

Anyway, so the news discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: On July 15, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian V?an and James Huff, will be going through the main gender politics-related news of last two weeks in Europe, while also throwing around some impressions from the recently ended International Conference on Men's Issues.

In Norway, the Labour Party introduces men's rights issues in its manifesto for the next elections, a move that is bound to rub some leftist feathers the wrong way. In a region of Britain, "misogyny" is to be recorded as a "hate crime" even if objectively no crime has been committed in the first place in the eyes of the law. The new sexual offences regulations in Germany are being increasingly criticized by more and more parts of the society as being unreasonable. And also in Germany, one of the country's top feminists has now been criminally charged for defrauding the German taxpayers.

In a Spanish province, all teachers are to be automatically considered guilty of sexual misconduct until proven otherwise. And they have 10 days to do that. In Britain, young feminists are horrified of their loneliness since over 95% of young British women utterly refuse this demented ideology. In Sweden, the almighty Feminist government wants to prevent rape with... wristbands. And in Switzerland, the big gendered issue du-jour is... handshakes.

Description: On June 3, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the previous week in Europe.

The Feminist establishment is again in full attack mode. But unlike any other previous times, this time it is themselves who are the most fearful. Joining them are the usual suspects - the so-called "traditionalist" women - who slowly start to realize that this long ride in which the male sex is screwed over at every turn is very likely to end bad for women.

Title: Trans Central Station
Date: 2016-05-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Zo9t7gc8h-I
Description: The news cycle has been alive lately with transgender issues. President Obama threatened to withhold funding from schools who don’t allow people to use restrooms according to their gender identity and half of what passes for conservative America reacted by showing how much they hate and fear men.

People from coast to coast are standing in line for their turn at the fainting couch, terrified that our decent womenfolk are at risk from encroaching biological males.

It's a sad and beautiful country.

Fortunately, we menfolk needn't worry. Or so it would seem by the lack of concern from politicians and pundits who are convinced that women are in grave danger.

This, and much, much more will be the topic of discussion on a special AVFM Hangout, with Paul Elam hosting a panel of three people who happen to be transgender.

Join Paul and Zander Keig, Theryn Myer and Blaire White for an in-depth discussion of the emerging transgender political movement and how it impacts the dialogue about men and boys.

That happens on Saturday, May 21 at 5:00 PM Pacific, 7:00 Central and 8:00 Eastern, here on A Voice for Men.

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 122 – When misandric culture is slowly acknowledged
Date: 2016-05-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NUxiCcLuXjU
Description: On May 20, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the previous week in Europe.

UNICEF Hungary was faced with a nationwide backlash over a series of overtly anti-father videos played in cinemas across the country. In Ireland, the much higher propensity of men to be victims of suicide is slowly being acknowledged as being in part because of the reluctance of most to admit that men deal with problems quite differently than women.

In other news, the most spectacular (and gruesome) murder case in Russia in recent years may end quite fast because the murderer is female. Oh,... and telling a woman she looks tired at work is sexist. Because... well... we don't exactly know why. But we'll try to find out.

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 121 – When equality in the family starts

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=y7JofpCMwR8
Description: On May 13, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian V?an and James Huff, will be going through the news of the last month, with a focus on parenting.

After over one month of break, Voice of Europe returns. There is no way to summarize the last 34 days in one episode, so we chose the topic of parenting to focus on - since the feminist sector has been producing a tremendous amount of whining on this topic in the last month.

Apparently, our philosophical opponents are all for equality in theory - but heaven forbid it starts happening in practice.

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 120 – When ideology suppresses all reality
Date: 2016-04-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=fKQObwaadTU
Description: On April 8, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the previous week in Europe.

A Norwegian communist politician was raped a while ago. Now he spends his time bemoaning the fact that the rapist was punished. Also, the European Court of Human Rights just ruled that reality is not an argument even for voluntary-based armies. All armies must have more women in them - even if women don't want to join, or simply can't cut the mustard.

When ideology suppresses all reality, it's one step closer to living in a very scary place. When obvious reality has to openly be denied in order to meet the ideological criterion, that's not a good sign.

In other news, France went full Sweden and adopted the Swedish-inspired policy on prostitution which regards all the Janes as prostitutes and all the Johns as predators. In other other news, Feminism is getting one step closer to be duly recognized as a religion as freedom of thought and speech in more and more campuses becomes even more restricted.

Description: On April 1, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the previous week in Europe.

There comes a time when in the name of various stripes of politically correct ideologies - not even the welfare of children can be reason enough to refrain from imposing ideologically correct decisions. This is the only explanation through which putting a 12 year old boy in jail with adults over a false allegation can make sense. Or preventing a father from seeing his 9-year old son out of fear of spurious and demented allegations of "racism".

In this episode, there will also be a higher-than-usual does of stories from what is colloquially referred to as "The Silly Place".

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 118 – Have men gotten soft?
Date: 2016-03-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=jBedLutqS7c
Description: On March 25, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be hosting a new episode of Voice of Europe. Last week's European media has brought quite a few interesting analysis asking covertly and then overtly if men have gotten soft(er) and, if so, why.

If members of the non-Feminist community would occupy a bit of the mainstream space asking if women have ceased to be women, it would be an outrage. But, on men, it's always open season.

In other news, German feminists have proved how much they care about the victims of rape - by destroying the crime scene and possibly crucial evidence that could lead to the victimizer of a 24 year old woman who had been brutally raped. Swedish parents now seem to be very annoyed that there is such thing as "boys' clothes" and the Serbian prime minister personally launched a "women in business" program paid for by the overwhelmingly male taxpayers. These and much, much more will be covered in tonight's episode.

Anyway, so the stories discussed are as follows:

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 117 – The totalitarian entitlement of IWD
Date: 2016-03-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=xJX97tgPgTY
Description: On March 4, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be hosting a new episode of Voice of Europe. Last week has brought us the grotesque spectacle of International Women's Day marches which have brought, for the most part, a glorification of communism and severe displays of totalitarian entitlement.

If members of the non-Feminist community would organize a march similar to those organized in Stockholm or Bucharest, they would probably risk arresting under various laws purporting to prevent the glorification of totalitarianism. But when it's Feminists doing it in the name of all women (including, and especially non-totalitarian and non-Feminist women) - that's all fine and dandy. But... is it?

In other news, the issue of legal paternal surrender has hit the Swedish mainstream public discourse, albeit from the least loved source these days. Consensual sex between two 16 year olds is apparently illegal in Ireland - but only for the young man, because reasons. Honest judicial diligence in rape cases is "problematic" in Spain and could get a judge suspended for daring to ask the obvious questions. And, of course, the English-language media misrepresents the case to cater to the Feminist sensibilities.

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 116 – Admitting to female evil
Date: 2016-03-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7N6iivNoTB4
Description: On March 4, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be hosting a new episode of Voice of Europe. Last week has brought us several cases of plain and unabashed evil perpetrated by women against others (particularly men and children).

This is nothing new, nor rare. Women have been partners of men both in building the civilization and in perpetrating evil. But for some reason, acknowledging that some women do indeed commit evil (just like some men) is still very hard for the Cathedral media even after decades of knowledge gained and taught.

In other news, sex-quotas don't work. Shocking, we know. In more other news, male genital mutilation is more and more under heavy attack in Norway, and in "patriarchal" Iran all men of certain villages have been executed for alleged drug offences.

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Title: Lindsey of the Daily Beast Takes a Dive
Date: 2016-03-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=WL0Z0vR5egw
Description: Lindsey has been writing for the Daily Beast, posting videos on YouTube and using Twitter with missionary zeal to document and disseminate dirt on all the men in her life that hit on her, some of them allegedly following up with rape threats when she doesn’t put out.

Lindsey has been most brave and unrelenting in her efforts. Well, except that she does it all anonymously and has started to selectively remove her content from the internet.

MRA Jack Barnes has been following her actions closely (Lindsay might call it cyberstalking, but no sane person would) and has a lot to report. This includes her recent attempt to report a rape threat to the police, but sadly for Lindsey it only resulted in police being unimpressed.

Damn the patriarchy.

Tonight, at 7:00 Central, 8:00 Eastern I will be talking with Jack Barnes about Lindsey no name of the Daily Beast and all the histrionics she is trying to employ for the sake of attention.

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 115 – Genital mutilation and the effects of misandry
Date: 2016-02-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-EQNffpYI_Y
Description: On February 26, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian V?an and James Huff, will be hosting a new episode of Voice of Europe. Last week has brought genital mutilation back into the headlines as a medical journal made the case that since MGM is legal, the equivalent forms of FGM should also be legal - a move which compelled, for the first time, individuals of the establishment to speak about shunning MGM altogether alongside FGM.

In other news, the effects of institutionalized misandry are starting to be noticed - but the usual suspects still insist to divert the blame upon vague entities such as "society" - rather than admit to being wrong.

Oh... and don't miss the silly place portion!

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3459178/FGM-akin-male-circumcision-breast-implants-designer-vagina-ops-Gynecologists-argue-genital-nicks-don-t-harm-girls-legalized.html

Date: 2016-02-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=sZaW0hB5FE8
Description: On February 19, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be hosting a new episode of Voice of Europe, this time focused on the mainstreamization of the idea that such thing as the PC police is not a conspiracy theory, but a hard fact of life in modern European societies - and gender ideologues are chief officers in this.

In fact, the PC police is so strong that the Spanish National Police Corps had to bow to the pressure of the PC police.

In other news, there is also a rising awareness amongst the populace about the contemptible falsehoods perpetuated by gender ideologues - such as the gender pay gap mythology or the "oppression in the workplace" mythology.

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

In other news, girls wanting to dress as princesses and boys wanting to dress as superheroes at the kindergarten's carnival is inherently oppressive and sexist according to Norwegian pedagogues who cancelled the carnival altogether for that reason. Meanwhile, in Great Britain, it is now a reality to have the police order men to notify the police before having sex. You know... just in case they rape somebody. Welcome to the brave new world!

Description: These are exciting times. The feminists are doubling down on their usual tricks, and pushing their agenda with more than usual determination. Meanwhile, the grassroots cultural insurgency against feminism's cultural regime shows every sign of accelerating. Are we just pushing the river? Can we sit back now, and reach for the popcorn, and let history take its course?

On this episode, Fidelbogen and co-host Elizabeth Hobson will talk about all of this and more. We'll also talk about the Gregory Alan Elliott verdict and its implications, and we will discuss the emergence of a distinct "non-feminist" political identity in England. We'll touch upon a few other things too, and we hope you can join us.

Description: On January 15th, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian V?an and James Huff, will be hosting the second Voice of Europe episode for 2016 - which will be somewhat of a continuation of the previous episode as a sizeable portion of the talk will be focused around the migrant crisis (included, but not limited to the events in K?.

In other news, Belgium and Finland have "consent classes" for non-European immigrant men because, you see, they need to be educated on how to behave with women. In addition to the fact that these policies don't work and don't achieve their intended purpose, they actually harm some of the younger ones, as they learn that in Europe only women have rights and they have none - as it happened in Finland where they didn't know that it is not ok (not to mention illegal) for old women to give 13 year old boys money for sex.

Many controversial stories in this episode - as in most episodes, since Voice of Europe is the show that doesn't shy away from ruffling anyone's feathers.

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Title: Paul Elam and Roosh V: Head to Head
Date: 2016-01-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=LTDO0u9AimA
Description: After years of mutual sniping occasional public pissing matches it is time for a civil, direct conversation between prominent members of two oft conflated but very different communities.

Despite the fact that the mainstream media works diligently to lump PUAs, Game practitioners, MGTOW and MHRAs into one seething, monolithic mass, they are actually groups with very different social and political ideals – as well as mostly incompatible goals. To put it simply, we don’t like each other very much.

Roosh V, founder of the Return of Kings website and intellectual father of the concept of neomasculinity recently issued a challenge to allow him to appear on an AVFM hangout to answer to some statements that have been made about him, and to do so in what he calls a “civil discussion.”

AVFM Founder and Publisher Paul Elam will field Roosh’s concerns (and voice some of his own) in an hour long discussion starting at 6:00 PM Pacific, 8:00 Central and 9:00 Eastern on Thursday, January 14.

Title: The Vanguard Report – The Feminist/Non-feminist Cooperation Spiral and What it Means
Date: 2016-01-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Xl7zZKUYpAc
Description: On episode number 79 of the Vanguard Report, we will talk about the dynamic of polarization that will occur as the non-feminist revolution continues to develop, and how the Great Middle Mass of fence-sitters will wither away as it gets pulled in either a feminist or anti-feminist direction.

We will also discuss once more how the University Campus can serve as a crucible for non-feminist political identity formation. If we find time, we might even discuss some topical news stories. Do join us for this episode.

Title: All Muslims Are Rapists and That's All They Are /sarc
Date: 2016-01-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=WAFZAae9kCU
Description: Cologne, Germany. A hoard of Muslim men took to the streets on New Year’s Eve, defiling every decent, God Fearing white woman in sight. Some of the women were mutilated, having fireworks blown up in their face. Scores were raped, groped and otherwise sexually assaulted. The men were all following instructions from ISIS and all they did was done in the name of Allah against the Great Satan of the western world.

Police agencies offered a lethargic response and failed to create accurate reports because they are afraid of being labeled as racist and Islamophobic. They also forgot to photograph any of the carnage.

That is exactly what happened, and anyone who disagrees is not a proper, God Fearing member of the alt right.

Then there is another version. A small number of (likely) males, some of unspecific Northern African decent, may have acted inappropriately on New Year’s Eve. This was immediately blown out of proportion by atheist heathens who want to blame everything on religion, especially where it concerns Islam.

Seeing the wisdom of silence, the western left (which is pretty much the complete western media) just kept their mouths shut, except to denounce anyone who identified any of the attackers as Muslim.
So went another event in an increasingly polarized and irrational world.

Tonight, at 6:00 PM Pacific, 8 Central and 9 Eastern, you can join AVFM Founder Paul Elam and Generalissimo Shit-Stir, aka Dean Esmay, for a rational and sometimes opposing view of these recent events.

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 110 – The Cologne incidents and the absurd language
Date: 2016-01-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=uYOS6BZIwD0
Description: On January 8th, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be hosting the first Voice of Europe episode for 2016 - and after two weeks of absence, there is a lot to cover.

On New Year night, several violent incidents took place - most of them with female victims. But feminists were nowhere to be heard or seen and when they eventually spoke up... they blamed white men.

Meanwhile, the "white male privilege" narrative completely and utterly collapsed at the end of 2015 - showing just how lopsided and borderline Orwellian the language has become where the most derided group can be "privileged" and the most connected, wealthy and safest group in the history of mankind (that would be white European women) can still be "oppressed".

Absurd language, absurd policies and further details on the Cologne/Köln incidents will be our topics today.

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Title: Jimmy Kimmel is full of shit and so is Roosh
Date: 2016-01-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=shyLQJhDChQ
Description: It started recently with typical feminist hack pieces like you would find in the Independent. A run of the mill, mainstream feminist writer quoted some shitbird from Return of Kings (ROK) on how they supposedly cost the latest edition in the Star Wars franchise big bucks with a boycott.

ROK, a loose collection of hateful, maladroit pinheads surprises exactly no one with the moronic assertion that they actually had an impact on the box office for the blockbuster movie.

Unfortunately, feminist media being what it is, has birthed the narrative that Roosh, a pussy hound and huckster who is one plaid suit away from a used car lot, is an MRA – and that ROK is an MRA website.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4hMq6rFpk0&feature=youtu.be

We don’t fault Roosh for that. He has never claimed to be an MRA (which we are most thankful for).

Still, it is a bit painful to watch that site become exactly what the SPLC said they were.

Tonight, on AVFM News and Activism, we will address the way the media is now so worried about the rise of men’s activism that they are actually coordinating to affiliate the men’s rights movement with the likes of Roosh.

This discussion and other topics will commence at 6:00 PM Pacific, 9 Eastern on the A Voice for Men Channel. James Huff and Paul Elam are hosting.

Title: The Vanguard Report - Episode 78 - Feminists and Non-feminists: Can they coexist?
Date: 2016-01-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Asq3oOh4ebQ
Description: This episode of the Vanguard Report will be an episode unlike any that we've had before. Today, non-feminists Fidelbogen and Kevin Wayne will be hosting not one, but two self-declared feminists: Russian Deadpool and Poison Ivy, of the Skeptic Feminists YouTube Channel. This duo recently appeared on the Honey Badgers, and we are glad to have them here as well.

Let's face it, we are in a growing culture war between two sectors of humanity - the feminist sector, and the non-feminist sector. A lot depends on these two groups getting along on the same planet without stepping on each other's toes. Today's episode will be a kind of diplomatic meeting under the white flag of truce. It is important to understand that this is NOT an argument or debate of any kind - it is a conversation for mutual clarification, and that rule will be enforced.

We hope that you can join us for this historic occasion. Pass the word along, and we will see you on Sunday.

Theryn Meyer is a university based men’s rights activist who happens to be a trans female. As part of a growing number of trans people now fed up with discrimination against men and the feminist narrative, she has some things to say as someone who has walked both sides of the gender binary.

Most importantly, she has a lot of say about the issues facing men and boys, particularly as it applies to the university setting.

Tonight, Paul Elam interviews Theryn, with the promise that tough questions and tough answers won’t be avoided.

The interview starts at 8 PM Pacific Time US 11 Eastern.

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 109 – Freedom is oppressive

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 109 – Freedom is oppressive

On December 18th, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the last two weeks.

Women choose jobs that are not consistent with the all-encompassing Feminist worldview - so they are thus oppressed. More to the point, they choose to leave others alone and thus suppressing the spread of Feminism even further. This must be corrected!

In other news, Norway becomes the first nation in Europe to consider giving HPV vaccines to boys as well and Serbia joins the chorus of "we must stop the violence against women" whining because women having a 3 times smaller chance of being killed and a 10 times smaller chance of being beaten obviously makes Serbia a hotbed of violence against women.

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Link to interview with Zander Kieg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnGQM1b7KrE

Perhaps one of the more common internal squabbles within the MHRM relates to people who are transgender. Yet when we talk to such individuals we find that they are uniquely qualified to give personal experience from having walked on both sides of the gender fence in life.

One of our best experiences with that was in speaking with Zander Keig, a trans male clinical social worker who works with combat veterans. Zander provided us with invaluable insights that highlighted the fact that where it concerns life experience, he shares more in common with men than women.

Tonight, on a special edition interview we will cross the divide again and speak with Blaire White, a trans woman who lived life first as a male, then a female. She also happens to be an antifeminist with MHRA leanings.

I our minds, that is a story worth telling and hearing. And that is what we are going to do, Tuesday, 12/15 at 7 PM Pacific, 9 Central and 10 Eastern.

Join host Paul Elam and guest Blaire White for a live, video look down the rabbit hole of transgender life and sexual politics.

Yes, feminists are people, but other people are people too, and all people can have a shot at controlling the language.

Scientists from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have adapted Microsoft’s Xbox Kinect technology to help take better X-rays.
This new take on an existing piece of technology could solve two common problems that affect image results when taking X-rays: motion and body-part thickness.

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 108 – The "they fight you" stage

On December 4th, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the last week.

Whilst non-feminist concerns were sometimes ridiculed and often ignored by the establishment - things have changed radically in the last year. Nowadays non-feminist victories are a lot more often encountered and given coverage in the media and, what's more important - the new actions by the feminist minority are being openly questioned by the same media, whereas nothing of this sort was to be expected merely two years ago.

And the news section tonight reflects just that.

Anyway, so the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Title: AVFM-NA with Paul Elam – News Special One
Date: 2015-12-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=sT5-JxL7eZc
Description: As the facts emerge from the terrorist massacre in California, we find the distinct possibility that the mastermind and chief instigator of the shooting spree was an Islamic woman.

Before the victims are in the ground, feminist fingers are frozen above their keyboards. It will take the likes of Kimmel, Daily Kos and Jessica Valenti some creative thinking time before putting forth their theories on how toxic white masculinity are behind the melee. It will be tough, given the fact that such notions are bullshit but this crowd will find a way.

Join co-hosts James Huff and Paul Elam as we take a look at the slaughter in San Bernadino and how it plays out in direct contradiction of the feminist narrative.

We start at 9:00 PM Eastern Time tonight.

Description: On November 27th, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the last week with a focus on International Men's Day (as many things remained uncovered last week) and the double-down on rhetoric practiced by the tiny Feminist sector under the growing backlash coming from the non-Feminist majority.

This time Movember is "problematic" and generally everything is sexist (but only if it's related to masculinity) because... potato or something.

Title: The Vanguard Report - Episode 72 - What the feminists fear most: Anti-feminism!
Date: 2015-11-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MW10FBwFKY4
Description: Feminism is under heat and pressure these days. It is growing and spreading. What we need most is a general public conversation about feminism itself, with a free-for-all intellectual critique open to everybody, everywhere, with no holds barred. The world has everything to gain from this, but feminism has everything to lose. That is why the feminists want to drive a wedge between "men's rights' and "anti-feminism" - to isolate anti-feminism, and make men's rights vulnerable to a feminist takeover.

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 106 – IMD and the coming non-feminist backlash

On November 20th, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the last two weeks with a focus on yesterday's International Men's Day and the increasing exposure of men's rights discourse in the mainstream and the blatant non-feminist approach that is already the norm in increasing corners of the mainstream where no such thing was even imaginable two years ago.

So, the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

Description: Tonight on AVFM News and Activism, hosted by Paul Elam and James Huff, we have Steve Brulé of Studio Brulé.

Brulé sprang onto the MHRM scene as far as most of us know when he captured a video that went viral in November of 2012, when feminists staged a violent protest at the University of Toronto outside of a lecture being given by Warren Farrell.

Since then we have seen his real work as a documentarian at various events involving men’s issues.

It’s about time we sat down and got more acquainted with a man who has become such an important part of this movement.

We kick off at 9:00 PM Eastern Time with 30 minutes of news stories, then we’ll pour a round and have a nice chat with the man behind the camera.

Tonight on A Voice for Men News and activism the news will take a back seat. Rather the news and interview will be combined.

We will start with an interview of Paul Batey, an Australian addictions counselor who also happens to be quite an expert on men’s issues. Given the way addictions and alcoholism disproportionately affect men, this should be a lively and informative discussion.

After that discussion we move on to talk with the man who is faced with the daunting task of filling the shoes of former AVFM Managing Editor Dean Esmay. Not a job anyone would envy, so all the more kudos to Mr. Brockway for taking on the challenge.

Robert will discuss his vision of the future for AVFM and tell us how we will get there.

Please join me, as well as AVFM Radio Director and co-host James Huff, as we tackle to very tough subjects tonight on A Voice for Men News and Activism.

The relentless pain starts at 9 Eastern Time.

Apparently, putting #killallmen into pseudo-scientific and pseudo-academic jargon is suddenly supposed to be a more persuasive argument, or something.

From the trashing of his marriage by wife Dina Mackney, to the alienation of his children, to his being harassed legally terrorized, Chris reached his snapping point and took his life.

Recently we ran Chapter One of a book on this incomprehensible tragedy, Bullied to Death, by Michael Volpe. And tonight we are Joined on AVFM News and Activism by Mr Volpe for a discussion of this story. Plus we are having a surprise guest host for the show.

Description: Friends, as non-feminist men and women, feminism has stolen plenty of things from you. Among these are non-feminist life, non-feminist liberty, and the non-feminist pursuit of non-feminist happiness. Why, the bastards will even steal your non-feminist soul from you, if you let them get away with it!

Understand, that you owe feminism no answers. This is a deep concept, maybe deeper than you know, but on this episode of the Vanguard Report we will try to scratch the surface of it, just a little bit. We hope you will join us.

The reaction to the obvious trolling of mainstream media getting caught doing what they do best, which is not their jobs, makes for a funny reminder to always check out who’s telling the story.

No more 'MythBusters'; show will say goodbye in 2016
http://www.cnet.com/news/mythbusters-ending-in-2016/
For 13 years, hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman have built crazy contraptions and blown stuff up in the name of science. But after conducting 2,950 experiments, busting 1,050 myths and creating 900 entertaining explosions, the pair will say goodbye to the "MythBusters" series this winter.

Hands-free technology in cars hardly danger-free, study finds
Many cars today have technology that is supposed to fight distracted driving, but a new study by the released Thursday shows how going hands-free can be more dangerous and distracting than first thought.
The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety study found using the voice-controlled system in cars that syncs to smartphones can distract drivers long enough to go not one football field, but three, once they've finished using it.

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 104 – Orwellian feminism

On Ocotber 23rd, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the last two weeks with a focus on the Orwellian fashion in which feminists keep on redefining words until no more clear thoughts can be formed.

The other big topic today will be the issue of false allegations and how the way they're being addressed has changed lately - particularly in Britain and Norway.

So, the stories discussed tonight are as follows:

On Ocotber 16th, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the last two weeks with a focus on violence committed by women (against other women as well as against men and boys) and freedom of expression.

The two topics may appear unrelated but in the midst of the Bahar Mustafa scandal, the two could not be more related. Make sure to tune in for a roller coaster of news and analysis in this Voice of Europe episode.

On September 8th, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the last two weeks and then tackle the latest piece of legislation that is due to be voted upon tomorrow (September 9) in the European Parliament.

AVFM reported on the topic urging the European readers to write letters to the Members of the European Parliament to reject what is now called "The Rodrigues Report" - http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/feminist-governance-feminism/call-to-action-the-eu-is-out-of-its-mind-again/

Description: Radical feminism is an embarrassment to the rest of feminism because it blows feminism's cover. Other feminists would like to tidy it away, out of sight, but it never fails to pop up again sooner or later. It seems the radfems can never contain themselves for long - eventually the pressure becomes too great to bear. This may be their most useful feature - the man-haters gotta hate, and they gotta let it all hang out. When they do, we'll always be there to capture the evidence.

On Vanguard Report 62, we'll expand upon this theme with some recent developments by way of illustration. Do join us for this episode.

Be wary of the mobile porn app named Adult Player. This app is currently targeting users by taking photos of the user as they use the app. This is a blackmail scheme, and it will cost you $500 USD.
It's just a good idea to not install apps that are not found on official sites, such as google play or the Apple store.

http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/01/sneaky-little-hobbitses-how-gamers-transformed-the-culture-wars/
The great and powerful Gandolf the Gay (aka Milo Yiannopoulous) has penned another great article, talking about the uprising of Gamers, and Gamergate. This time creating a link between the gamers who have stood against Social Justice Warriors, and the Hobbits of Middle Earth.
In thinking about it, it could only be gamers who could stand against those who would bring such evil to the world.

Metroid Hero Samus Aran Can Be A Transgender Woman Or Not And The World Will Keep Spinning
http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2015/09/03/metroid-hero-samus-aran-can-be-transgender-or-not-and-the-world-will-keep-spinning/
Erik Kain brings a thought to the idea of Samus Aran being transgender. This is a piece that pretends to act like it sits right in the middle of the road between the SJWs and those fighting against them.
However, it seems that he is hiding behind the middle ground in order to push the agenda that the SJWs have a point.

Metroid’s Samus Aran is a Transgender Woman. Deal With It.
http://www.themarysue.com/metroids-samus-aran-transgender-woman/
Brianna Wu, along with Ellen McGrody, try to make a case that Samus Aran is transgender. While this is based upon a lot of small circumstantial things that are completely unconnected, they make the case in order to continue to push an agenda. This is shown in the next article penned by Wu...

Well, That Escalated Quickly: A Samus Followup
http://www.themarysue.com/a-samus-metroid-followup/
"Fellow geeks, it’s time to sit down and have an adult conversation about the way some of you reacted to the mere possibility that Samus could be a transgender woman. Pull up a chair, because this is really important."
No, Brianna, you don't want a conversation. You want to tell people how it is going to be. Those of us who have played this little game are sick of your calling for a conversation.

WSB-TV has been trolled by someone getting them to try and tie the WDBJ shooter in with GamerGate. This is grade A trolling, and the news media has fallen for it, hook, line, and sinker.
Once again, we need to remind news media that they need to fact check. Otherwise they will continue to look like buffoons.

Title: The Voice of Europe – Episode 98 – Feminist censorship in the media
Date: 2015-08-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=KiGfhIQ0Q8k
Description: On August 28th, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the last week and then tackle the efforts of the Feminist establishment to censor non-feminist discussions in the mainstream media.

A group of women's organizations in Germany complained because the State television hosted a discussion on whether gender studies and gender mainstreaming have gone too far. As a result of their complaint, the show has been taken down from the station's archive.

Is this a sign of our philosophical opponents getting into panic as their ability to censor has been reduced in the rest of the society? Has the feminists' ability to censor really reduced or is this episode in Germany just business as usual?

These and other questions related to feminist censorship are going to be discussed after the news section in tonights episode.

The stories discussed tonight in the first part are as follows (as usual, those not in English will be read in full during the broadcast):

http://metro.co.uk/2015/08/24/someone-has-started-a-petition-to-class-feminism-as-a-terrorist-group-5357917/?i

Description: Are you NOT a feminist? If that is true, then let me tell you : you are involved in a war, whether you like it or not. That's right, feminism starting by waging war against men and all things male, but it didn't end there. It escalated, it spread out, and soon involved anybody who would "just say no" to feminism. Don't feel bad, you didn't start this war. None of us did. But we ought to understand what is going on if we are looking for any kind of a reality-based solution to the things afflicting us nowadays.

On episode 60 of the Vanguard, this is what we will be talking about, along with plenty of other things. Do join us.

Happy Birthday Spider-Man! 53rd Anniversary Of First Comic Book Appearance
http://comicbook.com/2015/08/10/happy-birthday-spider-man-53rd-anniversary-of-first-comic-book-a/
Spiderman turns 53 this month. We talk some of our favorite (and not so favorite) moments in the wall crawler's history.

Hollywood Needs to Stop Stereotyping Gamers
http://www.wired.com/2015/08/geeks-guide-gamer-stories/
VIDEOGAMES ARE THE world’s most popular form of entertainment, and gamers come from all walks of life. But you wouldn’t know it from watching Hollywood movies, which tend to split gamers into two groups: those who use their exceptional abilities to fight aliens ( Ender’s Game) and those who are total losers (Grandma’s Boy). Science fiction editor John Joseph Adams wishes there were more realism and variety to the gamers we see on screen.

Don’t ever call Felicia Day ‘queen of the geeks’
http://nypost.com/2015/08/08/dont-ever-call-felicia-day-queen-of-the-geeks/
Yes, please don't call her the queen of the geeks. While she says “That implies I represent everybody, and in life I think you need to represent yourself,” the way she acts is that of a victim. She doesn't represent geeks, nor is she really much more than a glorified booth babe.

Geek Is the Future and Felicia Day Is Leading the Way
http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/interviews/a37185/felicia-day-geek-culture-gamergate/
This article starts off like so: "Felicia Day won't say "Gamergate" aloud. The neologism flared up in August 2014 when a hive mind of gamers launched a scatterbrained attack against video-game journalists and feminists. Day, a popular actress, vlogger, and geek entrepreneur, was one of its victims."
She wasn't a victim of Gamergate. She had nothing to do with gamergate. Stop lying to people.
Looks like she is about to become another "Literally who."

GAMERGATE IS COMING SATURDAY TO MIAMI
http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/gamergate-is-coming-saturday-to-miami-7182604
GamerGate is a civil war between videogame fans and the gaming journalists who review those games for niche websites like Kotaku (which is owned by Gawker). Those fans accuse the journalists of colluding with game manufacturers – even swapping sex for favorable press.
Many of those journalists say the gamers hate them simply because they’ve written positive stories about feminists who accuse videogames of being sexist and misogynistic. Indeed, GamerGaters decry “social justice warriors” who want to make their games less sexual or violent and who lobby game developers for more diverse characters.

GamerGate’s Anniversary and the Rise of the VideoCons
Speaking of birthdays, Gamergate celebrates it's 1 year anniversary this month, with SJAirplay happening. However, people still seem to think that Gamergate supporters are mainly right wing. But let's let the article have a chance: "What do you call a movement that began by calling out a self-described rapist and fighting to get funding for a media project designed by women? A movement whose mascot is a woman? A movement that has given thousands of dollars to help a brutally raped sex worker get back on her feet, while being made the target of a bomb threat that may have been encouraged by a man who believed that “rape is normal?”
Apparently, if you’re a feminist you call them a “hate group,” “terrorists,” “rape apologists,” and “worse than ISIS.”"

The invisible hordes of online feminist bullies
http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/8/the-invisible-hordes-of-online-feminist-bullies.html
"GamerGate, the ongoing battle for the soul of gamer culture, has touched on everything from concerns about ethics in the field of video game journalism to questions about what kinds of players count as “real” gamers in the first place. It’s also the name under which a subset of largely white male gamers has launched harassment campaigns against feminist game makers and game critics such as Anita Sarkeesian, Leigh Alexander, Zoe Quinn and Brianna Wu."
Sorry, Ms. Condis, but #Notyourshield disproves you. Try some fact checking.

Challenge accepted: interviewing an Internet #hashtag
http://www.gamepolitics.com/2015/08/12/challenge-accepted-interviewing-internet-hashtag#.Vc9LRflVikp
Brad Glasgow goes into how he interviewed a leaderless movement, in this piece. With but a little thought, he seemed to come up with a good idea, that seems to work.
Gee, games journalists, why couldn't you think of that?

All this, and much more, on this episode of Tales from the Infrared.

Description: All sorts of regular folks, in growing numbers, have had it with feminism -- and they are coming out and saying it boldly. It looks like we are entering a new stage in this conflict, where the other side will find it wise to come to an understanding with non -feminist people. But is it really possible for feminism and non-feminism to coexist upon the same planet? We have our doubts, but we feel it is a good plan to float this idea, and make it part of the cultural narrative anyway. On episode 58 of the Vanguard, we will talk about this and related themes. We will also share news and views. Do join us.

http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/07/31/superman-actor-dean-cain-on-gamergate-im-on-the-gamers-side/
Actor Dean Cain, best known for his role as Superman in the iconic hit TV show Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, has revealed he is “on the gamers’ side” in the GamerGate movement.
Having defeated Lex Luthor in the 1990s, Cain has now thrown his hat in the ring against a nefarious new super-villain: the rainbow-haired social justice warrior. On Steven Crowder’s show earlier today, Cain & I discussed the threat to artistic freedom posed by pearl-clutching activists whose fact-free rants about sexism and violence have infuriated both gamers and game developers.

This particular hit piece is trying to tie Gamergate to the death of Cecil the lion. Apparently, according to the author, Gamergate has even been run out of polite internet society.

No. It really hasn’t “finally” embraced gender parity. It’s become popular, and now women want to join in. When it wasn’t popular, you couldn’t get very many women anywhere near this type of stuff.
Silly Guardian. You know not what you speak of, as usual.

'Rowdy' Roddy Piper Dies at 61 From Cardiac Arrest
http://www.tmz.com/2015/07/31/roddy-piper-dead-dies-wwe-wrestler-cancer/#ixzz3hX9n1yqM

Wrestling legend "Rowdy" Roddy Piper has died at the age of 61. Piper -- born Roderick George Toombs -- died from cardiac arrest in his sleep at his home in Hollywood on Thursday night. He was discovered on Friday. Piper was a wrestling icon -- one of the biggest stars in the WWE back in the '80s, and even wrestled in "Wrestlemania I" back in 1985 ... squaring off against Hulk Hogan and Mr. T.

Maybe I was wrong
http://spjairplay.com/update6/
Michael Koretzky talks about SPJ Airplay, and how things went horribly wrong with the Gamergate panel. It’s not like this wasn’t expected, but some of the requests made by the Gamergate side were reasonable, and he refused to allow them.
Is this a case of Koretzky going off, or is it a case of Gamergate going crazy?

No, I'm lying. Mike Rugnetta will NOT be our guest on the Vanguard Report today. But we want to persuade him to appear on the show in the near future, because we want to discuss the idea of feminist people and non-feminist people coexisting on the same planet.

We doubt that its possible, but we're sure that Mike Rugnetta can talk us out of feeling that way. . . right? But since he's not really on the show today, we're just going to talk about the POSSIBILITY of him being on the show in the future.

Everything You Know About Boys and Video Games Is Wrong

Boys think women are over sexualized, and video games are just for boys! At least, this is what the author says the game industry is saying. However, according to the author’s studies, she found the exact opposite, and boys think women are too often treated as sex objects.

In the study of about 1,400 US youths, 47% of middle-school boys and 61% of high school boys agreed that women are treated as sex objects too often in games.
The findings counter to any assumptions that boys will voraciously consume media images of scantily clad women without a second thought.”
I want to see this study, and see how biased it is.

Ellen Pao Stepping Down as Reddit Interim CEO After User Rebellion
http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/ellen-pao-stepping-reddit-interim-ceo-user-rebellion/story?id=32369495
Ellen Pao, the interim CEO of Reddit, stepped down from her position today following criticism from some forum users over the firing of a popular employee.
Steve Huffman, a Reddit co-founder and original CEO, will return as chief executive, according to a Reddit announcement.
"In my eight months as reddit’s CEO, I’ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly on reddit," Pao said today in a resignation post. "I just want to remind everyone that I am just another human; I have a family, and I have feelings. Everyone attacked on reddit is just another person like you and me."
Maybe you will realize firing a good employee, might be a bad decision.

#GamerGate: ABC Producer Tells Senator To STFU Regarding Investigation
http://blogjob.com/oneangrygamer/2015/07/gamergate-abc-producer-tells-senator-to-stfu-regarding-investigation/
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation was caught in an alleged lie regarding their coverage of #GamerGate. They told the ACMA that there were no interviews on hand to offer a counter perspective to the slanted news story they ran on #GamerGate, even though it turns out that they did have interviews on hand offering a counter perspective. One of Australia’s Senators has been investigating the ABC recently after charges of journalistic impropriety were brought to his attention, and ABC producer Tom Greenard said that the Senator could “STFU”. For those not in the know, it’s an acronym that means “Shut The F**k up”.

Description: Just days ago Lauren Southern with Rebel Media crashed a Slutwalk. She was actually carrying an arsenal of weapons including her brain, her mouth, a microphone and a camera. In her wake she left a number of Slutwalkers looking as foolish as their couture.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qv-swaYWL0

One of her questions, ‘How many rapes will that shabby bikini made of crime scene tape prevent?’

The video went viral, now amassing over 688,000 views in just a few days.

I will be interviewing Lauren Southern today at 5 PM Pacific Time, 7 Central and 8 Eastern.

As if this were not enough, we will also be joined by Lauren Brooks, a big Tom Leykis fan and avid AVFM supporter who has quietly been the driving force behind many of our social media efforts, and who took the initiative to make sure this interview happened.

I am happy to invite you all to join Lauren, Lauren and me for a chat about people who think rape prevention can be found in a parade of cellulite and stupidity.

RENOWNED AUTHOR CALLS OUT RANDI HARPER’S AMAZON TROLLING
http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/06/03/renowned-author-calls-out-randi-harpers-amazon-trolling/
Despite the efforts of Amazon to stamp out the practice on its website, a recent controversy involving Vampire Chronicles author Anne Rice and an infamous online activist suggests it remains a hot-button issue for authors.
The topic has attracted renewed attention due to the involvement of Randi Harper, a controversial activist, in an apparent review-trolling campaign against a book by the technologist Vivek Wadhwa on Amazon. Harper has previously been accused of using her position as CEO of the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative (OAPI) as a means to divert attention from her own bullying behaviour on social media, and many of her critics are presenting this as another key example in a trail of controversy.

Maybe The Matrix Ruined Science Fiction Movies
http://io9.com/maybe-the-matrix-ruined-science-fiction-movies-1709197938
The Matrix was a hugely influential film, which helped launch a million black-clad wuxia-fueled adventures. But maybe it had an even bigger impact? Josh Friedman, creator of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, suggests The Matrix ruined science fiction movies.

Tomorrow sees the release of Sense8, the super-ambitious epic from the Wachowskis — so it’s perfect timing that today, we’re questioning the impact of their most famous work. Today on Twitter, Friedman went on a fascinating rant, dealing with the difficulty of getting a huge enough audience to watch science fiction on television. And the massive budgets needed to make science fiction “work” on the small(er) screen.

All this, and possibly more, on Tales from the Infrared.

Voice of Europe is transforming as a show with a view to become even more news-centered than before and with one or two trends being discussed instead of a topic. This episode is the second in the transitioning series.

British courts are to assume that women who drink suddenly turn into children – but only when they have sex; Romania pulls a Sweden and bans an internationally awarded auto commercial and an Italian court recently went against a mother’s will with regards to the son’s alimentation at the request of the father.

The trend discussed in this show: The ever harsher “sexting” laws and if they’re really what we want as societies.

This is going to be good! So, tune in, folks!

Description: On May 29th, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the last two weeks.

Voice of Europe is transforming as a show with a view to become even more news-centered than before. This episode is the first in the transitioning series.

The Pope said that the marriage strike is a proof of “male chauvinism”. The Swedish Police Authority just admitted to committing discrimination against men for the past 3 years. And in Serbia, the state will go from implied gynocentrism to overt gynocentrism – as representatives from “UN Women” convince gullible officials. These, and other news will be thoroughly covered.

Also, two trends will be discussed in this show: The overall global staggering improvement of women’s health – and how that is viewed as a bad thing by the Cathedral media and the increasing number of European women wanting to join ISIS.

This is going to be good! So, tune in, folks!

The show will commence at 7 PM GMT (London, Reykjavik and Lisbon time).
That is 8 PM CET (Madrid, Paris, Brussels, Rome, Oslo, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Budapest, Berlin, Vienna, Warsaw, Amsterdam, Bern, Bratislava, Prague, Belgrade, Tirana, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sarajevo and Skopje time)
That is 9 PM EET (Helsinki, Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius, Kiev, Chisinau, Bucharest, Sofia, Athens, Ankara and Nicosia time)
That is 10 PM FEET (Minsk time)
And, finally, 11 PM Moscow time.

Title: SGTC #6 Mommy Bloggers and Why They SUCK
Date: 2015-05-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=w0axuwNqSjI
Description: OK, you are a very comfortable, married woman with children. You have a good roof over your head, help with childcare, maybe even assistance with housecleaning and other drudgeries of daily life. All courtesy of a husband with a profession that pays for all of those very nice conveniences.

So, the challenge becomes what to do with your leisure time, which is now pretty much all your time. Why of course you go register with Cafemom.com or some other mommy blogging site where you can spend hours a day trashing out your husband and picking at all his “flaws”, proving to the world you don’t pay that much attention to your children, who also have “flaws” you want to talk about.

Perhaps once you grow tired of using the free time bitching about the man who provides you the opportunity to do so hours on end, you can start a flame war attacking stepmothers, for not being “real” mothers; for being less than you are as a biological mother. It is Golden Uterus Heaven!

At this point you know you have hit pay dirt. You can spend ALL your time complaining about your privileged life, and you will get a ton of support from it from your fellow Mommy Bloggers. What’s not to like?

Well, you.

Please join Paul Elam and Dr. Tara Palmatier for the next episode of Say Goodbye to Crazy, where we will talk about the greatest concentration of crazies outside a gender studies program and why they suck like a Hoover with a power attachment.

We start on Thursday, May 28, 2015 at 4:30 PM Pacific, 6:30 Central and 5:30 PM Eastern.

A marriage that ends in divorce is supposed to play out somewhat like a movie. It starts with promise and a bit of mystery about what is to come, the characters develop, the plot deepens and takes some twists and turns. Finally the story reaches its climax. Then the credits roll, AND IT IS OVER.

This is not always the case. Sometimes, when a man is married to Crazy, she views the divorce as just the next, more enhanced level in the relationship. It is the phase where she gets keep being abusive, take his money and play the children like they were titanium ping pong balls. You know, business as usual only now she has the power of family courts to back whatever she wants.

Often in these scenarios she is not the only one who looked the other way while the ending credits were rolling off the screen. There are men who will, years after a marriage is “over,” still be at her disposal for everything from yard work to getting that next, latest version of a Coach purse that she just has to have.

These men don’t let it register that they are divorced, and still act like a servile husband, even after the divorce papers are starting to yellow with age.

They are, in effect, still married to her. Rather they are just married to whatever it is she wants at the moment. It’s like a bad marriage that does not end until someone dies.

Please join Dr. Tara Palmatier and Paul Elam today for the next installment of Say Goodbye to Crazy, “How to Divorce Your Ex Wife”
We start at 11:00 AM Pacific, 1:00 Central and 2:00 Eastern

Description: The Voice of Europe – Episode 88 – British politics with Mike Buchanan

On May 15th, Jon Gunnarsson, Lucian Vâlsan and James Huff, will be going through the events of the last two weeks and then, in the second part, Mike Buchanan, founder and president of the political party Justice for Men and Boys (And the Women who Love Them) will come to the microphone to talk about the last general elections in Britain and general politics.

J4MB may not have won a seat in Westminster, but they sure did draw attention to men’s issues, playing the media’s sensibilities impeccably. And this is not editorializing – there are parties who got at least one seat and who received less media attention.

We’ll also be very curious to find out Mike’s take on the new Justice Minister in Britain who, at a first glance, seems to be quite in line with J4MB’s platform. Is that an accident or a result of a cultural shift at least within the winning party (the Tories)?

These and other events will be thoroughly covered in tonight’s show.

So, tune in, folks!

The show will commence at 7 PM GMT (London, Reykjavik and Lisbon time).
That is 8 PM CET (Madrid, Paris, Brussels, Rome, Oslo, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Budapest, Berlin, Vienna, Warsaw, Amsterdam, Bern, Bratislava, Prague, Belgrade, Tirana, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sarajevo and Skopje time)

Title: SGTC Episode #4: How to Divorce Your Mother
Date: 2015-05-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=aZJhe11uey8
Description: Hush now baby, baby don’t you cry.
Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you.
Mama won’t let anyone dirty get through.
Mama's gonna wait up until you get in.
Mama will always find out where you've been.
Mama's gonna keep baby healthy and clean.
Ooooh baby oooh baby oooh baby,
You'll always be baby to me.
Roger Waters


If the lyrics to this Pink Floyd song from “The Wall” strike a little too close to home for you, then you might want to watch the next episode of Say Goodbye to Crazy with Paul Elam and Dr. Tara Palmatier entitled, “How to Divorce Your Mother.”

If your mother counted on you to be “her little man,” constantly putting you in the role of an adult with the responsibility of being her emotional caretaker, you have likely found that your adult life bears a strong similarity to your childhood. Mother is still counting on you to kiss her booboos, hold her hand through every hard turn of life (even if she has to create the need for it), now that you are a much bigger man.

She may take a dim view of any woman you choose to be with, the implication being that anyone you choose simply will not be good enough for Mommy.

Worse, if you do manage to choose a woman you may make the unconscious choice of picking someone who is way too much like the mother who manipulated you into taking care of her instead of the other way around. That can have disastrous results in many ways, but two are most prominent.

One, your female partner and Mother may make your relationship the battleground for control of your attentions and concern. The other is that they may work together to control you. Sometimes they go to war first, then enter a truce where the unconscious agreement is that they will control you together.

Whatever scenario, the solution starts with a divorce…from your mother. This means you learn to overcome her manipulations and learn to develop the boundaries that she ensured you would not learn as a child.

Join is on May 7, 2015 at 8 AM Pacific, 10 Central and 11 Eastern for “How to Divorce Your Mother,” on Say Goodbye to Crazy.

And for more tips and tactics on learning boundaries with anyone, including your mother, you can buy our book, Say Goodbye to Crazy, on Amazon.

Title: SGTC #3: Facebook Golden Uterus Mom Memes
Date: 2015-05-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=E5jnJLHIYBk
Description: To buy Say Goodbye to Crazy: http://www.amazon.com/Say-Goodbye-Crazy-Yourself-Restore-ebook/dp/B00TLIFCQ4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430781862&sr=8-1&keywords=say+goodbye+to+crazy

Some Facebook mom memes are sweet and some are self-deprecating and silly. Some are clever. Some express the universal joys and frustrations of being a mother.

Then there are mom memes that, if you aren’t both a mother and a raging narcissist/emotional cripple, make you want to throw up in your mouth a little while rolling your eyes. Hard.

Like the one posted to the left, for instance. That isn’t just a mom meme. It’s a Golden Uterus mom meme.

Crazy uses and abuses social media like it’s her own personal PR firm, 24/7 all-you-can-eat ego buffet, selfie billboard, random thought receptacle and battleground where she wages war against her “enemies” all rolled into one. Facebook Golden Uterus mom memes are usually about the self-aggrandizement of the sheer awesomeness of Crazy’s gilded loins, how hard it is to be a mom, how moms are way better than fathers, and, in some cases why dads aren’t even necessary and why a child, even an adult child, must be forever grateful to mommy and put her first above all others.

Crazy posts these memes for different reasons. Sometimes she’s doing a victory lap, or sending “coded messages” (the middle finger) to her ex (or his new wife). Sometimes she’s communicating with her Golden Uterus mom cohorts in a Golden Uterus validation echo chamber. And sometimes she’s chest thumping, pity seeking or attention seeking. Heck, when it comes down to it, it’s all attention seeking behavior, isn’t it?

Whatever message Crazy thinks she’s communicating, we think her narcissism and penchant for emotional incest come across proud, loud and clear. If you think these kind of memes are harmless and not indicative of characterological pathology, just try replacing mom/mother for dad/father and see how the copy reads.

With Mother’s Day fast approaching as well as the release of Say Goodbye to Crazy (follow the link to purchase), we will be discussing Facebook Golden Uterus mom memes on the next SGTC (formerly known as Going Mental) scheduled for Tuesday, May 5, 2015 at 2pm EDT, 1pm CDT and 11am PDT.

Title: SGTC Episode #2 The Golden Uterus
Date: 2015-04-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=rzXheBQgvQ8
Description: Do you have an ex-wife who acts like her position as “Mother of the Children” places her in some sort of exalted position, ever above reproach or questioning because she happened to succeed at breeding with someone?

Is she officious, demanding, always claiming that she has a lock on what is in the best interest of the children (even when partying on child support money)?

Does she get outraged when you fail to follow her edicts as though she were some sort of deity?

If you are starting to rack up some yeses to these questions, then we have two things to say. One, congrats on your getting a divorce.

Two, our condolences.

You were married to a Golden Uterus.

And that is the problem. Normal divorces are kind of like movies. They start, the story plays out, the ending credits roll, and then it is OVER.

When you divorce a Golden Uterus, the end credits can take decades to actually end. To her, her position as the all holy Mother of the Children immunizes her against criticism for anything she does as a mother, even if she is giving Mommy Dearest a run for the money. If her immanence does it, it MUST be the right thing to do.

Please join us today, April 30, 2015, at 11:00 AM Pacific Time, 1:00 Central and 2:00 Eastern for Episode #2 of Say Goodbye to Crazy, with Paul Elam and Dr. Tara Palmatier.

We will talk about the Golden Uterus; the signs and symptoms and what you might be able to do about it, including how not to get sucked in to marrying one in the first place.

That last bit is pretty important, since once you get in to a Golden Uterus it can really be difficult to get out.

Title: AVFM Radio Special: William Coleman, Falsely Accused with a Silver bullet
Date: 2015-04-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=yV29OkeawMM
Description: In 2005 William Coleman, a British national living in Waterbury Connecticut, was accused of sexually assaulting his then wife two days after he had filed for sole custody of their children. This isn’t that uncommon of a tactic especially when facing the threat of losing access to one’s own children. In fact, in my own country of Canada, prosecutors and defense attorneys know this as “The Silver Bullet” tactic. Just by mentioning terms like “rape”, “sexual assault” and “abuse”, a custody case quickly transmogrifies into something that can only be described as a modern re-enactment of the Salem witch trials. But nobody is acting.

This tactic has proven extremely effective in distracting the court from its true purpose in the case… the children. By using any of those terms against a man he finds himself in the unfortunate circumstance of having to defend himself from the position of being presumed guilty not only by the family court, but also the public court of “Social Justice.”

The inevitable conviction, despite passing a polygraph proving he was not guilty, awoke something inside him. The realization that he was chewed up and spat out by a corrupt legal system designed to intentionally skew the truth rather than uncover it, led him to protest by going on the longest hunger strike I have ever heard of… 7 years.

Join Christian Chiasson, host of Tales From The Infrared, in a special live interview on Wednesday, April 8th at 1PM EST (10AM PST, 6PM London) with William Coleman and hear a story of corruption and torture. However, this isn’t fiction.

For the rest of the show, we will share several interesting items from the internet, including a Washington Post article which suggests that feminists are suffering a kind of "combat fatigue" due to massive hostility they are getting from the non-feminist public.

Title: The Unveiling of Dean Esmay 3.0

Description: At 5:00 PM Eastern Time, 4:00 Central, we will be unveiling the latest model of Dean Esmay, aka Esmay 3.0. Dean started out as a long haired hippie type with Golderwateresque evil conservative leanings. Then he switched to red diaper doper baby with a visage of Karl Marx tattooed somewhere in his nether regions.

And now, in perhaps his final human form of existence, Dean Esmay 3.0 launches as a hybrid of Christopher Hitchens, Orson Wells and War Machine.

Where this is going, no one knows. When asked what he would be speaking about in today’s hangout, Esmay simply replied “stuff,” and then hung up on us in a fit of outrage.

Watch this hangout at your own peril.

Description: Tomorrow, March 31, 2015 at 9:00 PM Central, 10:00 Eastern we invite you to the debut of “Say Goodbye to Crazy(SGTC),” with Paul Elam and Dr. Tara Palmatier.

Buy Say Goodbye to Crazy here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014W0587S?*Version*=1&*entries*=0

SGTC is a program dedicated to providing information and inspiration to those dealing with some sort of Crazy in their life. It is a no holds barred, gut level honest discussion about high conflict personalities and what you need to do to keep them from pooping all over your life.

In Episode One, we will be responding to a great deal of criticism we have received from those alleging that our advice to people dealing with Crazy is fundamentally hostile to people with mental health issues. And we will be giving it to you straight from the horse’s mouths. Our comments are full of remarks that we are either misinformed or malicious or both. So, we will be reading those comments and responding to them for the duration of the program.

The point here is not to invite Crazy into the conversation, but to inform viewers why Crazy and Crazy’s enablers have it wrong.

We hope you join us for what we think will be a fun and informative chat.

And please remember, you can preorder our book, Say Goodbye to Crazy, right here:

Want to learn how to say goodbye to Crazy, whether it's your current partner, an ex, a friend or a family member? You're going to find out how on the next episode of Going Mental.

It doesn't matter if Crazy is a borderline, a narcissist, a sociopath or a straight up jerk, there are strategies to, if not eliminate Crazy entirely from your life, to greatly reduce her or his presence and impact.

Please join Dr Tara Palmatier and Paul Elam on Wednesday, March 11, 2015 at 10pm EDT, 9pm CDT and 7pm CDT when they will discuss some of the basic tenets from their upcoming book, Say Goodbye to Crazy.

Description: AVFM’s Intelligence Report is back! After an extended hiatus for breeding and harvesting kittens, IR returns with a new lineup. After discovering that Dr. T was, in fact, a woman, we replaced her immediately. As she goes on to lead the demolition against Crazy, a full time occupation, Australian Paul Beatty will move into position with Dean Esmay and Paul Elam, making Intelligence Report deliciously male dominated.

We kick things into gear today at 2 PM Pacific Time, 4 Central and 5 Eastern with a triad of topics including a greasy review of Jeff Sharlet, a mainstream feminist writer so yellow his oversized forehead has been mistaken for a second sun.

The story you will hear about him would be grounds for him to sue us, save for that fact that it is all true. Jeff Sharlet owns the gold standard on sleaze.

Also on board are two other stories. One, it appears that Tony Abbot and Bill Shorten will soon be channeling Emma Watson. Also, hell freezes over yet again, this time at Slate.com, where there was actual critique of the latest feminist propaganda film, “The Hunting Ground.”

As we peel back several layers of socially programmed denial and confusion, we see that we live in a society that has invested a lot of energy into disabling the health intelligence of men and boys.

As we will also see in this discussion, even much of the modern information touted as now “healthy” for men and boys is just another misdirection, and it affects women in the same negative way that it does men.

Join us tonight, starting at 4 PM Pacific Time, 6 Central and 7 Eastern.

Tom Golden and Paul Elam will be cutting through the food industry bullshit to have some straight talk about food and nutrition that won’t leave a bad taste in your mouth. It might make you think twice about what is going into your basket at the grocery store.

The fun starts today at 6 PM Central, 7 Eastern. Make a bowl of popcorn and pull up a chair.

Going Mental is back, and we'll get into the fine tuning of dealing with Crazy. By Crazy, of course we mean personality disordered basilisks who can put more chaos into your personal life than a battalion of blind, drunk soccer hooligans.

There are 5 basic fears common to these life-wreckers. If you know what those fears are and you are willing to use them with necessary force for effect, you can quickly convince Cray-Cray that messing with your life is like a trip to the casino with your last paycheck. Not recommended.

Get "Say Goodbye to Crazy" here: http://www.amazon.com/Say-Goodbye-Crazy-Yourself-Restore-ebook/dp/B00TLIFCQ4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1424442582&sr=8-1&keywords=say+goodbye+to+crazy

And the cold fact is that if you have a Crazy in your life, using those fears like a bludgeon is one of your few ways out.

Join Dr. Tara Palmatier and Paul Elam on Tuesday, February 19 at 8:30pm CST for a discussion of Crazy’s five greatest fears and how to leverage them to convince her to go bother someone else.

Title: Terms of reconciliation with KSU feminists
Date: 2015-02-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=u-5Cb2XMHjA
Description: Faculty of the Kennesaw State University (KSU) Interdisciplinary Studies Department (ISD) have spent the better part of 2014 making Sage Gerard's life miserable. Thankfully Sage is unharmed, but today he faces unreasonable restrictions on his freedom to associate based on the feelings of a select few professors. Sage has been barred from asserting himself to abusive academicians who decided to use their degrees to report Sage to the cops as a potential serial killer, among other lovely things.

Even after KSU acknowledged that the ISD's inflammatory character allegations have no merit, Sage is still not allowed to solve his own problems with faculty members like an adult normally would. Paul Elam has since taken it upon himself to release documents related to Sage's case in what is now an ongoing article series and expose every professor that tried to silence Sage Gerard.

KSU YESBody!, the student organization most closely affiliated with the ISD, criticizes Paul Elam for "confirming" the already manic fears of ISD faculty. Once again the feelings of bullies are central to the discussion so long as the victim is a male student and the perpetrators are politically fashionable.

Join us February 17th at 9:30 PM EST / 8:30 PM Central to hear Paul Elam and Sage Gerard state non-negotiable terms for reconciliation. This is, of course, assuming that ISD faculty wants the peace, love and understanding it markets to KSU students.

It should be obvious that entrusting your heart (and wallet) to a woman (or man) who gets paid to have sex and paid to fake love, affection, sexual attraction or orgasms is both unwise and a highly risky gamble, that is if you want a monogamous, stable relationship based on love and not a series of transactions.

Given the number of men who become involved with sex workers, strippers (“exotic dancers”), prostitutes, “sugarbabies,” porn actors, former child actors, “swingers” and straight up gold diggers expecting a Pretty Woman outcome, it’s apparently not as obvious as it could be. We have worked with a number of men — young men and older men who are old enough to know better — who have had their hearts broken and lives trashed by women like this, so it’s a good time to tackle the topic on this week’s Going Mental.

Please join Dr. Tara Palmatier and Paul Elam as we discuss these issues and more today, February 10, 2015 at 9:30pm EST, 8:30pm CST and 6:30pm PST when we discuss these issues and more.

How Do You Know When a Sociopath, Narcissist or Borderline Is Lying?

Their lips are moving.

The End.

That’s a facile and clichéd answer, but, more often than not, an accurate one.

Sociopaths, psychopaths, narcissists, borderlines and histrionics lie for many reasons. Self-preservation (e.g., to avoid jail or other unwanted natural consequences for their bad behavior), to manipulate or exploit others to get money, sympathy, power, attention, security, a relationship or whatever their current currency happens to be and/or to make themselves look good or more successful than they actually are. Sometimes, these individuals lie when the truth would serve them better or they lie simply because they’re bored.

They also lie because they enjoy the buzz or adrenaline rush from “getting one over on” or “outsmarting” their target. Dr Paul Ekman calls this rush duping delight.

. . . duping delight, the near irresistible thrill some people feel in taking a risk and getting away with it. Sometimes it includes contempt for the target who is being so ruthlessly and successfully exploited. It is hard to contain duping delight; those who feel it want to share their accomplishments with others, seeking admiration for their exploits.

. . . The presence of others witnessing the successful liar typically intensifies the delight experienced and increases the chances that some of the excitement, pleasure, and contempt will leak, thus betraying the liar.”

Clients describe this phenomenon in relation to the sociopaths, psychopaths, narcissists, borderlines et al in their lives and have witnessed it firsthand in some of my past personal relationships. In previous articles, I have referred to it as the Sociopathic Smirk. The smirk that says, “I just tricked you” or “I just pushed your buttons.” These individuals derive pleasure from both.

Dr Bella DePaulo’s research on lie detection finds that the closer one is to the liar, say a spouse, partner, family member or friend, the more difficult it is to spot their lies.

When you’re in a relationship, you not only have the experience in knowing the other person, you have certain motivations to see your partner in a particular way, and you especially don’t want to think that they are lying to you.”

If your partner is abusive and/or disordered, you have probably been gaslighted and told that every nasty or dishonest thing your partner does is your fault. “It’s your fault. Your face shouldn’t have gotten in the way of my fist.” “I wouldn’t have had to cheat if you were paying attention to me 24/7/365, even when I wasn’t paying attention to you.”

Once you have been groomed to doubt your perceptions and, literally, what you are seeing with your own two eyes, it adds to the difficulty of spotting their inconsistencies, contradictions and straight up lies. It makes it even more tough if you still care about or love your abuser. You don’t want to believe what you know is true — or false. However, your emotional, psychological and perhaps physical survival depends upon learning their “tells.” Even the most practiced pathological liars have tells.

Please join Paul Elam and Tara Palmatier when Going Mental returns at long last on Tuesday, February 3, 2015 at 9:30pm EST, 8:30pm CST and 6:30pm PST when we will discuss lie detection, duping delight and the psychology of lying and liars.

Date: 2015-01-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0oMf7CKr5t4
Description: Mother Jones is an old school liberal publication with some respectable creds. Mariah Blake is a new school feminist. The combination was good for the latter, not so much for the former.

Blake recently used up 6,000 words of column space to pen a disingenuous attack piece on the MHRM, particularly on Warren Farrell, Paul Elam and AVFM. Pity after months of research and all that writing she offered up nothing different than what every second rate blogger in the yellow world of online feminism has been producing for five years.

In the process she took down any journalistic credibility that Mother Jones ever had.

Join us tonight as Tom Golden and Paul Elam pick through each of Blake’s lies, one by one, and demonstrate the difference between mainstream media and MANstream Media.

It starts tonight, right here at 4 PM Pacific, 6 Central and 7 Eastern Time.

As most of you know Bill has been at the center of a rape hysteria that would make Mike Nifong green with envy. As a result many members of the “one of the gender elite (a woman) said it so it is beyond question” crowd have chose to protest Cosby being allowed to…..well, do anything but die a thousand painful deaths.
The aforementioned MHRAs showed up to counter protest in favor of innocent until proven guilty and against lynch mob injustice. In this episode Dan and Jack were joined by Attila to discuss the events of that evening.

Title: MANstream Media: Feminism under fire?
Date: 2015-01-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=jkZVg_BhVEc
Description: 2014 was a year seeing some rather startling changes in the mainstream media. While the feminist narrative still dominates most publications, the antifeminist point of view, which started in the comment sections of many publications clearly triggered interests of publishers.

This is evidenced by the emergence of antifeminist perspectives in opinion pieces ranging from The Wall Street Journal, Mail Online, The Daily Caller, and less prominent but still heavily traveled sites like Breitbart.com and Thought Catalog.

One of the most notable pieces recently posted was, “Amanda Marcotte: The David Duke of Feminism,” a piece so scathing that it could have been posted to A Voice for Men without raising an eyebrow.

More and more, it seems, we are finding writers are taking the high road on low end ideology and attaching their names to the growing numbers of people who have simply had enough of feminism selling hate and supremacy behind a façade of tolerance and equality.

Join Paul Elam and Tom Golden tonight on MANstream Media Weekly, as we attempt to answer the question, “Is feminism now in societies crosshairs?”

We start at 4:00 PM Pacific, 6 Central and 7 Eastern.

Description: We promised that 2015 was going to be a year of movement at AVFM. We are in part going to keep that promise with some help the Bitch. The One Who Judges.

Suck It Up, Buttercup is a new AVFM Hangout that will be hosted by Janet Bloomfield, aka JudgyBitch.

Why have Janet host her own program? Because, fuck you, feminists. Because her distinguished style and delivery has made her the world’s first three time loser in Twitter Jail. Because feminists are so afraid of what this particular piece of eye candy has to say that they have launched secret campaigns designed just to silence her voice.

Solution? More voice! A lot more.

We have invited Ms. Bloomfield to host this program, throwing caution into the wind; to say what needs to be said in the way that only she can do. So hide your children and lock all the doors, people. Judgybitch is going to do some unfettered JudgyBitching and we will be all the better for it.

Her debut show is tomorrow, January 10, at 2 PM Central, 3 Eastern. Paul Elam will have the honor of being her first guest, with many more to come in the weeks and months ahead.

Title: IR: #Gawker gut=punched, @ZerlinaMaxwell spits on civil rights; feminists want people to burn
Date: 2014-12-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0e4mru2-plo
Description: Join us this week on Intelligence Report with special guest Mike Johnson, aka "The General." This week's show notes are found here:

http://www.avoiceformen.com/hangouts/intelligence-report-gawker-punched-in-the-gut-zerlina-maxwell-zerlinamaxwell-spits-on-civil-rights-and-feminists-want-people-to-burn-to-death/


Gawker Media—publisher of Gawker, Jezebel, Kotaku, and Polygon—admits they lost "seven figures" (which we're going to take to mean several million); its founder, Nick Denton, has stepped down; its editorial director, Joel Johnson, has been removed, and a new management team has been brought in. Apparently bullying nerds who won't buy feminist and general social justice warrior garbage is a costly mistake. They said Gamers are Dead and Gamers Don't Have To Be Your Audience—and they were at least right about the second part.

Zerlina Maxwell and other hateful ideologues say that no matter what the truth is, we should always believe rape claims.

That's right, in the world of social "justice" and extreme feminist ideology, no matter what the facts, even in the wake of the Rolling Stone UVA fiasco, we should "listen and believe" when "victims" (by which they mean almost exclusively women attacked by men) must be believed. Maxwell is part of a new wave of bigots spearheading the anti-civil-rights charge, and we'll have a lot to say about her madness!

Finally, the New York City Fire Department, in trying to appease feminist sensibilities in order to forcibly bring more women into its firefighting teams, is dropping physical standards. Who cares who dies of smoke inhalation or burns to death in New York City as long as enough people with boobs are part of the fire department, right?

We wish we were exaggerating about this crap, but we aren't. Join us at 5pm Central Time on this week's Intelligence Report as we continue to examine the madness of our times!

Title: MANstream Media: What Has Michael Flood Been Smoking?
Date: 2014-12-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=aN88NhPu-9o
Description: Recently Michael Flood invaded the comments of AVFM (for the second time) talking circles that hovered around, but never quite landing on, reality.

He appeared mostly concerned that anyone would call into question the current feminist narrative on Intimate Partner Violence. He even brought some research to “back him up.”

Tom Golden, as he is want to do, dig some digging into Flood’s contentions. What he discovered will shock you, even if you are an MHRA seasoned in the antics of gender ideologues.

Join us tonight at 4:00 PM Pacific, 6:00 Central and 7:00 Eastern for the next installment of MANstream Medial Weekly with Cohosts Tom Golden and Paul Elam.

Title: AVFM Special Program: A Message to White Ribbon Campaigns
Date: 2014-12-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=zC2hkQSozLU
Description: The White Ribbon Campaign had themselves a smashing success of “White Ribbon Day.” The Canadian branch of the organization was gifted with $300,000 of the Canadian taxpayer’s money, which will help them, in turn, to raise even more money so that they can raise more money.

We assume the White Ribbon Campaigns of other countries like Australia and the UK also experienced similar windfall.

But while fortune is currently in favor of the dubious organization, it was not all rose petals and petunias for them.

A scandal in Ireland involving phony rape statistics left them looking for an excuse and a scapegoat, which they quickly offered to a skeptical media.

The launch of WhiteRibbon.org, the website owed by domestic violence pioneer Erin Pizzey, has elicited defensive reactions from White Ribbon Canada and White Ribbon Australia, the latter of which has gone as far as to attempt to censor criticism of them from the eyes of the Australian YouTube audience --along with urging the Australian Parliament to take a dim view of anyone disagreeing with them.

Their troubles are not quite over.

Tune in to this channel for a conversation between AVFM News’s Robert O’Hara and AVFM founder Paul Elam at 6:00 Pacific Time, 8:00 Central and 9:00 Eastern, where Elam is expected to deliver a message directly to the White Ribbon Campaigns.

Description: One of the remarkable things about the Men’s Human Rights Movement is that it is a rare, unifying factor that connects men of all walks of life from across the planet.

One of the great examples of that is Romanian Lucian Valsan, Host of AVFM Radio Europe and director of AVFM’s multi-site operations. Lucian’s work has resulted in AVFM now being online in no less than eight different languages, with more on the way.

Lucian accomplishes all this while writing some of the best investigative articles that AVFM has the privilege to run.
We are long overdue to interview the opinionated and highly productive Valsan.

This is going to be a late one for Americans, as we are doing this on Lucian’s schedule. We begin at 1:00 AM Central Time, US, which is 9:00 AM at Lucian’s location in Romania.

Title: Rice reinstated, Enabling False Accusers and Buy a Feminist Dinner Because Equality
Date: 2014-12-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=9lCBuEsu-zk
Description: Tonight, at 4:30 PM Pacific, 6:30 Central and 7:30 Eastern Intelligence Reports returns with Paul Elam, Dean Esmay and Tom Golden.

Tonight we will be discussing a triad of stories. Up first, Baltimore Raven’s player Ray Rice has been reinstated after having been booted from the NFL for returning violence perpetrated against him by his fiancée and now wife.

http://blacksportsonline.com/home/2014/11/ravens-gm-testified-ray-rice-told-truth-to-goodell/

Also, the UK, has apparently been too hard on false rape liars. An organization, Women Against Rape, is heading to the House of Commons, led by American university professor Lisa Alvas. They intend to inform the HOC that the UK is unnecessarily harsh on woman who cry rape when it didn’t happen.

Alvas, by some coincidence, happens to be a law professor who specializes in gender studies and feminist law theory. Who’da thunk?

http://law.uark.edu/directory/?user=avalos

Finally, a shock of a double standard that no one could have predicted. A card-carrying, dyed-in-the-wool feminist, Yvetter Caster, writes for metro.co.uk that despite being a feminist, men should still pay for her dinner.

After all, she says, “Paying for a women on a date has nothing to do with feminism”

http://metro.co.uk/2014/11/27/why-women-should-never-go-halves-on-a-date-4964827/

Er, uh. Allrighty, then.

Looks like we will have plenty to discuss on tonight’s program. See you there!

Date: 2014-11-18

Description: OK, peoples, listen up. Twitter is currently setting itself up for the PR disaster of its corporate life. By allowing Jaclyn Friedman and her WAM (Women, Action, and the Media) group in their doors they have created their own monster. WAM has bullied and botted its way into aggressively manipulating who speaks on Twitter and who does not. Countless small accounts have been banned after tweeting in support of #gamergate , and other high profile targets like @nero, Janet Bloomfield and Thunderfoot have similarly been given the boot on at least one occasion. 

It is sparking a revolution that is building as we speak. Countless people, from the MHRM, from #gamergate and from #shirtstorm are linking up on #opSKYNET . For what, you ask?

Join us this evening and find out. AVFM’s Dean Esmay and Paul Elam, and Dr. Tara Palmatier of Shrink 4 Men will be discussing what is going on in the much anticipated consumer reaction to SJW infringement on free speech. 

Tune in a 3 PM Pacific, 5 Central and 6 Eastern for an Intelligence Report that will give you the inside scoop on the war that WAM has declared on the open exchange of ideas.

Title: The Truth About Intimate Partner Violence
Date: 2014-11-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=WqtkoEpHbbM
Description: Tonight, MANstream Media Weekly returns with hosts Paul Elam, Tom Golden and Dr. Warren Farrell. We will be talking about the problem of domestic violence, and in particular how a false narrative of the problem has dominated the social landscape for nearly half a century

In what has become the ultimate race to victimhood, feminists have painted a picture of intimate partner violence as an extension of patriarchal dominance into the home, and therefore a problem defined by men acting out physically against women.

Tonight we will show why this myopic and misleading way of looking at the problem has only made matters worse. And, importantly, we will be examining the real victims of this violence and how it impacts their lives.

The discussion starts at 4 PM Pacific, 6 Central and 7 Eastern right here on A Voice for Men

Title: IR: #Gamergate Continues, Teach Women Not To Rape and Sexual Assault in Uniform
Date: 2014-10-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vED7BguzeiI
Description: After a week-long absence, Intelligence Reports returns today at 1 PM Pacific, 3 Central and 4 Eastern with Paul Elam, Dean Esmay and Dr. Tara Palmatier covering one blood-curdling bit of Social Justice hell after another.

We will be discussing #GamerGate , the fuck up that SJWs just cannot stop to keep themselves from committing. The latest bit involves a threat from a gunman who was apparently prepared to go Complete Columbine at a Utah University if Anita “the damsel” Sarkeesian had spoken there.

http://www.avoiceformen.com/allnews/anita-sarkeesian-feminism-online-harrassment-2/

Also, we will be addressing Instapundit Glenn Reynolds’ ongoing “Teach Women Not to Rape,” campaign. His most recent target story is that of a Lehigh Acres, Florida woman arrested for sex with 15-year-old. “Deputies say Victoria Chaluisant first met the 15-year-old victim back in February. That’s when the two began exchanging text messages and eventually started sending naked pictures to each other. Investigators say Chaluisant would even pick up the victim at his home before school just to have sex.”

The Early Learning Coalition of Southwest Florida says Chaluisant was a Family Resource Advisor at the organization since April, working with parents to assist them in obtaining childcare for their children.

http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/?s=%22teach+women+not+to+rape%22

Finally, we will be discussing the rape of men in the military, 14,000 of which were victims last year alone, with few every reporting the crimes against them.

Title: AVFM Special from KraSU with Sage Gerard

The last time we brought you a hangout with AVFM Director of Collegiate Activism Sage Gerard and founder of Kennesaw State University Men (KSUM), we spoke of the incredibly inappropriate treatment Sage has faced on behalf of KSUM and AVFM at his school. 

Smear campaigns were waged against him there; campaigns which included the direct participation of at least two KSU professors. Anonymous emails containing gross disinformation about AVFM weres taken as empirical proof with no investigation whatsoever. 

A report was filed against Sage alleging that he was creating a “hostile atmosphere” for women at the university, and was told, with no evidence against him, that he was effectively banned from entering the entire interdisciplinary studies department is housed. 

The lies faced no resistance – from anyone -- and ultimately pushed two consecutive faculty advisors to terminate their support for KSUM. 
Tonight, Paul Elam will be back yet a second time with Sage Gerard, who is seriously going to wow you with some of the goings on to date at KSU.

The discussion starts at 1 PM Pacific, 3 Central and 4 Eastern today.

Title: MANstream Media Weekly: The Gender Wage Gap Myth and Why it Needs to Die
Date: 2014-10-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vzXhXu280Iw
Description: Tonight on MANstream Media Weekly Dr. Warren Farrell, Tom Golden and Paul Elam will be discussing the most tenaciously stubborn myth in the history of tenaciously stubborn myths. It is the idea that women are paid less for the same work as men because of gender discrimination.

This long debunked piece of disinformation is still routinely parroted by the mainstream media, academicians and politicians all over the world. Like belief in a flat earth, people cling to this idea as though the universe would implode if the truth were allowed to rule the day.

Please feel free to join us at 4 PM Pacific, 6 Central and 7 Eastern as we try to nail the coffin shut on the zombie apocalypse version of gender propaganda.

Title: MANstream Media Weekly: The Importance of Fathers
Date: 2014-10-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=QveaY3Hi2tQ
Description: Often in the men’s movement we speak of the injustice that men and their children so often face in the family court system, and about the deep wounding caused by the severing of the father-child bond resulting from those injustices.

While this is happening we see a culture that is ever questioning the importance of fathers in the lives of their children. Answers have not exactly been forthcoming, though to many the answers are obvious. 
Fathers matter, and a great deal.

Please join Dr. Warren Farrell, Tom Golden and Paul Elam for a discussion on fathers and the critical role they play in the lives of their children, both male and female.

As a part of our Top Ten issues facing men and boys, it will be the topic this evening on MANstream Media Weekly, starting here at 4 pm Pacific, 6 Central and 7 Eastern Time.

Title: Daddy Guilt. The Abuse and Control of Non Custodial Fathers
Date: 2014-10-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_NDHUz4WDfk
Description: Of the many things that fathers from broken marriages endure, guilt can be one of the worst. There is guilt from the breakup of the family; from being removed from the daily lives of children.

Worse than that, when the father comes from an abusive relationship, that guilt becomes a weapon used against him by the ex-wife. She uses it to extract money and cooperation, to continue her endless punishment of him for “failing” as her husband. She even trains her children in the same tactics, who learn to manipulate and control the absent father. 

While this is commonly the way these men have been treated when they were still married, it significantly worsens after the divorce resulting in alienation and often spilling over into whatever future relationships he might have.

Please join shrink4men.com’s Dr. Tara Palmatier and avoiceformen.com’s Paul Elam on Wednesday, October 1, 2014 at 3:30 PM Pacific, 5:30 Central and 6:30 Eastern Time for an important episode for fathers, on Going Mental.

Description: Today, September 30, 2014, Intelligence Report from A Voice for Men and shrink4men.com airs another episode. Starting at 3 PM Pacific, 5 Central and 6 Eastern we will be discussing #heforshe, the Twitter Hashtag that has gone viral, and has also been under severe fire from non-feminists.

Also, The Baltimore Sun has come out with an article By Susan Patton and Jonathan David Farley that puts a beating on the 1 in 5 college rape stats that have been tossed around like Halloween candy by the mainstream media and a large contingent of politicians in recent years.?r>
We will cover those and hopefully other topics as seen through the clarity of a red pill lens.

As always, Paul Elam, Dean Esmay and Dr. Tara Palmatier will be leading the discussion live, with your comments welcome.?r>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2762701/NFL-orders-staff-attend-domestic-violence-sexual-assault-classes-Roger-Godell-prepares-break-nine-days-silence-press-conference-today.html

Description: This week’s Intelligence Report is coming on a special day and time due to scheduling issues. But the wait will have been worth it.

Tonight, joining Dr. Tara Palmatier, Dean Esmay and Paul Elam will be special guest Sage Gerard, AVFM Director of Collegiate Activism. 

His input will be invaluable because tonight we are using the entire program to school rawstory.com on why it is a bad idea in the journalism business for people to be lying, censoring sacks of shit. 

No, we don’t expect them to learn anything. Aggressively ignorant asshole ideologues are not generally educable. Still, it is a lot of fun to try! And we’re going to bring you information about the practices at Raw Story that might even surprise some MHRAs.

Show up today at 3 PM Pacific, 5 Central and 6 Eastern as Intelligence Reports digs in to the raw bullshit coming from the Raw Story.

Title: The Minefield of Free Speech on a University Campus
Date: 2014-09-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=wES5r1GHj0U
Description: On November 1, 2014 a historic first will be happening on an American university campus. Jonathan Taylor of A Voice for Male Students, Dr. Janice Fiamengo of the University of Ottawa, Karen Straughan of the Honey Badger Brigade and Paul Elam of A Voice for Men will be standing up to speak at Kennesaw State University in Georgia at a conference sponsored by of Kennesaw State University Men (KSUM), a men’s rights organization. 

The backlash against this happening has been significant. Two KSUM academic advisors have resigned, one of them citing SPLC criticisms of AVFM which were sent from “anonymous” sources. KSU founder and president Sage Gerard has been subjected to verbal and even physical attacks. Specious investigations against him have been launched by university staff which are clearly ideologically driven and designed to derail his efforts to bring men’s issues awareness to that campus. 

Still, Gerard has persevered, and the November conference is scheduled to go ahead as planned, even as student and faculty protests are in the works.

Please join us today at 1 Pacific, 3 Central and 4 Eastern Time as I speak with AVFM director of collegiate activism and president of KSUM, Sage Gerard in an interview that not only provides the details of this event, but may well speak to the future of our efforts to bring humanist counter-theory to the dogma ridden wasteland of American academic life.

Title: What Part of Borderlines are Crazy and Dangerous Do You Not Understand?
Date: 2014-09-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=YgrfeRVRH1E
Description: Believe it or not, we actually get messages from men seeking support from shrink4men.com and advoiceformen.com that runs something along the lines of, “Hey, she slashed my tires, had sex with my nephew and cleaned out my bank account. Should I consider getting out of this relationship?”

In fact, many of the men seeking assistance for problems with women like this are men who, if hearing their own stories from any other man, would be screaming “Get out!” at the top of their lungs. But when it comes to saying bye-bye to crazy, destructive women in their own lives, they have the sad and destructive tendency to fold like a cheap suit.

We don’t believe these men are to be mocked and ridiculed. They represent a pervasive and socially mandated pressure to accept abuse from women – to see them as the victim and to see themselves as the ones responsible for making changes without ending their personal involvement. 

There is just one little catch. The social expectations on these men are as insane as the destructive, personality disordered women they are involved with. In fact, the personality disordered basilisk uses social pressures on men to put up with them as one of their primary weapons to continue abuse and control of their victims.

Continuing a relationship with such a person is like finishing a cup of coffee after someone has peed in the cup. The fact that men are pressured to drink a certain amount of piss does not change the fact that it is a completely self-destructive thing to do.

Please join Paul Elam and Dr. Tara Palmatier for the next episode of Going Mental, where we will address the topic of male denial and how it sets them up for more abuse from pathological, crazy women.
The show is Wednesday, September 23 at 3 Pacific, 5 Central and 6 Eastern Time.

Title: AVFM Interview: Janet Bloomfied, The Bitch That Has All the Bitches Bitching
Date: 2014-09-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=nhf5Kevf010
Description: AVFM’s Director of Social Media, Janet Bloomfield, also affectionately known as JudgyBitch to her thousands of blog visitors at judgybitch.com, has become a thorn in the side to whackaloon feminists, social justice warriors and other purveyors of goofball ideology geared to make people rich and powerful off being “poor and powerless.”

Bloomfield has become so much of a nuisance that they have mounted campaigns to suspend her twitter account in what can only be called a quintessentially stupid attempt to silence her. She has also been attacked online by victim-hooker Amanda Marcotte as one of seven women who want to take away women’s rights. 

The story behind the story? Janet Bloomfield, hot, blond and highly educated, captured the attention of high profile social media users with millions of followers with her snappy and unapologetic messages targeting the Royalty of Ridiculousness on the social media platforms they had grown accustomed to using without dissent or disagreement. She clamped down on their poon-privilege and, outraged, they went after her for it.

Please join me on Saturday, September 20, 2014 at 1 PM Pacific, 3 Central and 4 Eastern Time for a one on one interview with the bitch that has all the bitches bitching, here on AVFM Interviews.

Title: It is Mutilation, Stupid
Date: 2014-09-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=omV-KPVvA_c
Description: This week, Thursday September 18, 2014, at 6 Central 7 Eastern Time Paul Elam and Tom Golden will discuss a subject not many, even in the MHRM are inclined to discuss. It’s the genital mutilation of men at birth as a cultural norm. 

Unfortunately we live in a culture where even medical science shields itself in ignorance and savagery for the sake of a barbaric custom that is without medical or moral necessity. As often as not it is done without anesthesia. 

Euphemistically referred to as “circumcision,” the practice of genitally mutilating boys passes for religious freedom, relegating the status of infant boys to chattel who are subjected to whatever degradation a parent wants to inflict. Wherever the same happens to girls there is international outrage, and in most places it is illegal with harsh penalties.

Please join us on MANstream Media Weekly this week as Tom Golden and Paul Elam strip away the myths and the lies about this brutal, dangerous and immoral practice.

Description: Since the Ray and Janay Rice's reciprocal domestic violence incident is currently being rehashed again by the mainstream media and outrage addicts (comprised of clickbait journalists, feminists, social justice warriors, white knights and sheeple) are in an outrage-gasm, we thought it would be a good time to discuss the other half of domestic violence victims.

Men.

What does domestic violence against men look like?

How can men recognize if they're being abused?

Why does the media and society ignore the problem of female perpetrated intimate partner violence?

Why does the media and society think violence against men is acceptable and, oftentimes, funny?

Why do men have such a difficult time accepting that they are in fact being abused by a female partner, friend or family member?

Join Dr Tara Palmatier of Shrink4Men.com and Paul Elam of AVoiceForMen.com when they explore the male victims of domestic violence and the problems they face today at 5pm EDT, 4pm CDT and 2pm PDT on Going Mental.

Title: The Death of the NFL #nfl #espn #rayrice
Date: 2014-09-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=32rl2RkTNMs
Description: In response to Ray Rice tagging his then fiancé as a matter of self-defense, major sports media like ESPN and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell have gone to  MuffCon1, opening the door for feminist ideologues and handing them a jar of Vaseline on the way in to ideological control of the National Football League. 

Effective pretty much right fucking now, Lisa Friel, Jane Randel and Rita Smith will "help lead and shape the NFL's policies and programs relating to domestic violence and sexual assault."

Take that back about the Vaseline. They won’t be using it. 
NFL headquarters has moved to Duluth, people, and now we can expect a pro football future full of “real men PSA” clauses written into every contract. 

And word up, NFL Rookies. DON’T GET MARRIED. Not unless you want to hand her the Sword of Damocles to hang over your helmet, having the power to end your career. 

All this and more will be discussed this evening at 3 Pacific, 5 Central and 6 Eastern with Intelligence Reports hosts Paul Elam, Dean Esmay and Dr. Tara Palmatier of Shrink4men.com

Title: The Boy Crisis
Date: 2014-09-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0evR9pJ0rxs
Description: Today boys in modern culture are standing on the edge of a great social precipice. They are performing poorly in schools relative to girls. Fatherlessness is rampant, as is parental alienation.

Fewer and fewer boys are moving toward a future that includes college and economic success, and more are headed for the margins; prisons, gangs, addictions, unemployment and suicide. 

A society whose boys are in trouble is a society itself in trouble. 

Of the top 10 issues facing men and boys the Boy Crisis ranks at the top. This vulnerable population has very few advocates for their problems, and many who should be speaking about them remain silent. 

Please join Tom Golden, LCSW, Paul Elam and world renowned expert on the issues facing boys, Dr. Warren Farrell for this week’s episode of MANstream Media Weekly for an in-depth discussion about what is happening to our boys and what can be done about it.

The show airs on Thursday, September 11, 2014 at 4PM Pacific, 6 Central and 7 Eastern Time Here on A Voice for Men.

Title: Rebuilding Men’s Self-Respect After It’s Been Destroyed by a Wife, Girlfriend, Mother and Society
Date: 2014-09-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=dqvQcwSQoz8
Description: Men are dogs. #KillAllMen . Men’s only value is in providing for women. Your father is a loser. You’re just like your father, you worthless piece of shit. I don’t care if your sister hit you first, never ever hit a woman. Only men can stop domestic violence. Teach men not to rape.

Men have no emotions. Men suck at expressing their feelings. Men are only interested in using women for sex. Men are not allowed to sit next to unaccompanied minors on airplanes. Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them.

When counseling men on how to have better relationships and how to make better relationship choices, many mental health professionals say it’s a matter of developing a healthy sense of self-respect and self-worth.

But what if a man was never allowed to develop self-respect? What if his mother vilified men, including his own father, and masculinity?

Fatherlessness is a growing epidemic. There are now several generations of men raised by “single mothers.” Many of these men were raised to revere women (even horrifically abusive women) to their own detriment and received love and validation only if they pleased their mother. How does a man develop self-respect if he was taught from an early age that his maleness is bad and makes him less than?
What if a man has had his self-worth decimated after becoming involved with a toxic, abusive woman or series of women?

Abusers, whether they’re male or female, systematically dismantle their target’s sense of self and agency, often to the point where the target believes he deserves or causes his partner’s abuse. How does he restore his confidence and self-worth?

Join Dr Tara Palmatier of Shrink4Men.com and Paul Elam of Avoiceformen.com on Friday, September 12, 2014 at 6pm EDT, 5pm CDT and 3pm PDT for another episode of Going Mental when they discuss why r-e-s-p-e-c-t is a primary building block to healthier relationships be they platonic relationship, romantic relationships or business relationships.

Title: Intelligence Report: #Gamergate Continues. #dateoffcampus may be next
Date: 2014-09-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=8h2jF81iAGs
Description: Show notes: http://www.avoiceformen.com/hangouts/intelligence-report-gamergate-continues-dateoffcampus-may-be-next/

The “Gamergate” scandal continued and expanded last week as more publications were fingered with the allegation of cronyism, corruption and censorship.

Something else popped up, too. It was a very vocal and diverse group in the gaming community which is pointedly reminding the Social Justice Warriors behind all the corruption that they cannot hide behind them as a group. They gave birth to the #notyourshield hashtag to make that very point.

Also on Intelligence Report a Washington Examiner Opinion piece opinionates that young men in college are finally starting to react to rape hysteria on campus, not by marching in “Take Back the Night” rallies, but by avoiding college women. #dateoffcampus may be the new trending hashtag.

The discussion will start at 3 PM Pacific Time, 5 Central, and 6 Eastern here on AVFM and Shrink4men, with Dr. Tara Palmatier, Dean Esmay, and Paul Elam.

Title: The O'Hara News and Editorial with Men's Rights Group Arizona
Date: 2014-09-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=qTM1aIGHV0o
Description: Aired Sept 2nd 2014 - Men's Rights Group Arizona

This episode we had as our guest, Richard Cassalata ,of Men’s Rights Group of Arizona, one of the most successful state level Men’s Rights organizations in the U.S.

Arizona has been a hotbed of legislative and litigative activity concerning divorce, child custody and domestic violence in recent years. Successes in the areas of Men’s Rights include a comprehensive shared custody law enacted January 1st of last year, alimony reform and the removal of a judge who was found to be referring D.V. cases to an anger management clinic owned by her.

Men’s Rights Group of Arizona stands out as an example that, in spite of naysayers who believe the laws will never change, there is reason to believe activism can be highly effective.

Title: MANstream Media Weekly: Reproductive Rights for Men
Date: 2014-09-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=zIcLEQAMteM
Description: As MANstream Media begins its new weekly programming, we come out of the gate with one of the most controversial topics in the growing men’s movement.  Men’s reproductive rights. 

It is a subject that has inspired much discussion, disagreement and even division in the ranks of the MHRM, but many involved in the movement feel that if agreeing to sex does not constitute consent to parenting for women, neither should it for men.

This evening, September 4, 2014 at 4:00 PM Pacific, 6 Central and 7 Eastern Time, join your hosts Tom Golden and Paul Elam as they take on the topic of reproductive freedom for men.

Title: Going Mental: She Might be a Crazy Bitch if....... Red Flags!
Date: 2014-09-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=YoOUIlgxpgM
Description: Forewarned is forearmed and, when it comes to Crazy, ignoring the warning signs is not only foolish, it is potentially hazardous to your emotional and physical health.

Sometimes you can see Crazy coming a mile away. Sometimes the Crazy is so overt you can see the red flags waving from outer space. In fact, sometimes Crazy will tell you straight up, “I’m crazy (LOL!)” on your first date.

Here are some real life examples:

There’s a huge woodblock of the word “Princess” in her apartment.
Noting that Oprah doesn’t help men drives her into a frenzy of rage.
When she rages at you for an hour plus on the phone, you can put the phone down, walk to the bathroom, pee, wash your hands, pick the phone back up and she doesn’t notice you left.

She throws such a fit of rage at her 10-year old’s softball tournament that the park shuts down all the games, has every team meet in the middle of every field, and calls the cops on her.  Her child is subsequently removed from the softball team and you are banned for life from the softball park.

If you ignore the obviously crazy ones out of pity or the in the hopes of having “crazy sex,” you may well regret your recklessness later. Crazy is like Vegas — the house always wins. It’s very difficult to walk away from Crazy completely unscathed.

Sometimes the red flags are more subtle, but present nonetheless. Stealth Crazy is trickier. These individuals often seem to have good excuses for their bad behavior when the mask slips during the love bombing phase. The high functioning ones (i.e., better able to hide the crazy) can often keep a lid on the crazy until after you legally bind yourself to her through marriage or children.

Please join co-hosts Dr Tara Palmatier of Shrink4Men.com  and Paul Elam of Avoiceformen.com and their guest Terrence Popp of Redonkulas.com at 9pm EDT, 8pm CDT and 6pm PDT for a more humorous take on dating red flags and/or neon flashing signs that say, “Danger! Crazy lady! Dive, dive!” tonight on Going Mental.

We will also take a look at how college campus rape hysteria has resulted in a boringly predictable lack of trust in college women. Too much power in the hands of people who are too unpredictable, guys, so start considering #dateoffcampus as a hashtag and personal policy. And late-breaking, a story on us from NPR!

Title: MANstream Media: It is Time We Had a Talk
Date: 2014-08-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=AUoiXyhCP7o
Description: We are sad to announce that MANstream Media Monthly has been forced to change its name. It will henceforth be known as MANstream Media WEEKLY!

We are actually very excited to make this announcement and hope you will enjoy the programs every Thursday as much as we enjoy doing them. 

The new schedule starts today, August 28, 2014 at 4:00 PM Pacific, 6 Central and 7 Eastern Time when Paul Elam, Tom Golden and Dr. Warren Farrell will start a special series of programs that will focus on the top ten issues facing men and boys in modern culture.

One of the best things about it is that you will play a major role in deciding what those issues are. 

We are going to start today with what we are calling the number one issue, which is the fact that there is a very strong cultural code of silence about the pain and suffering of men and boys. It is still a career ending move for a lot of people. Talking about the men’s side of the gender story and telling it like it is can still end a career and result in being socially ostracized as well. 

It will get you shunned by a lot of men and women, get you attacked by the media and send protestors to try to stop you.

So for the first program, we are going to talk about not talking, and what we think the solutions are, including the need for men’s groups on the ground. After all, we can’t fix any of men’s problems if we stay silent about them.

We will also be talking about the lives of boys, from circumcision at birth, to how they are parented, to what society expects from them, to what society actually gives them. 

Again, we very much want you to help guide us through these top ten issues. We will be watching the comments closely. If you have an issue that you want to hear about, put it in the comments! If you see an issue in the comments that you strongly agree with, give it an up vote! We will be tabulating all of it and using your input to determine what we address. 

Welcome to the new weekly programming. We are looking forward to your input!

Title: Going Mental: You Might as Well Face it, You're Addicted to Borderline
Date: 2014-08-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=KdwFINCrlw0
Description: "But I love her! I know I should leave her, but I'm afraid she won't be able to survive without me. I just want to help her. She can't help it, she had such a bad childhood. Yes, she's abusing the children and me, but there's just got to be a way to get through to her.

She broke it off with me and won't speak to me. She's back with her ex who she told me abused her. I can't stop thinking about her. How could she just discard me like that? How could she go back to someone who was so horrible to her?"

Tara Palmatier: I receive emails from men expressing the above sentiments on a regular basis. These men are in pain, jonesing for a hit on the BPD crack pipe. Despite all sound judgment, intelligence and common sense, they are either staying with a BPD girlfriend or wife who is emotionally and/or ?ysically abusing them or in withdrawal from a BPD woman who was emotionally and/or physically abusing them. They put the "dependent" in codependent.

The addiction these men have to their abusers is every bit as toxic and potentially lethal as an addiction to heroin, alcohol, meth, cocaine or any other drug of choice. Some yearn for the early honeymoon-love bombing stage. Some are on a suicide mission to "save" a woman who will drag them down like a drowning victim -- except she will climb to safety on his dead back once she's destroyed him.

In hearing these men's declarations of self-destructive "love," you want to comfort them and shake some sense into them all at once. Please join Paul Elam of Avoiceformen.com and Dr Tara Palmatier of Shrink4men.com tonight, August 27, 2014 at 4 Pacific 6 Central and 7 Eastern for the next installment of Going Mental.

Title: Intelligence Report: Boko Haram, Crazy Walks and Munchausen Meets Mickey Mouse!

Description: A Voice for Men and Shrink for Men’s Intelligence report comes up a day late this week, but better late than never.

On the program today we will be discussing the Boko Haram story, which has been the subject of international outrage, but only for the females who were harmed. The media has all but ignored the men.

http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/world/africa/boko-haram-kidnapping/
There is also the story of Yasmin Thomas, a violent woman with 17 assault convictions on her record. She recently sliced up a man’s face with glass.

Of course, she walked free again.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2726219/Yasmin-Thomas-victim-disgusted-walked-free.html 

Also, Munchausen by Proxy Meets Mickey Mouse! Leatha Kaye Slauson needed some quick cash, so she shaved her 5 year old daughters head and paraded her around telling people she was dying of cancer and taking donations “Make a Wish Foundation” style. 

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2732567/Mother-got-community-help-fulfill-daughter-s-bucket-list-terminal-cancer-cash-donations-medicated-5-year-old-unnecessary-cannabis-oil.html

Finally, Men’s Rights Edmonton has some special plans for the next “Walk a Mile in Her Shoes (Christian Louboutin’s maybe?)” event. 

Please take a few minutes to watch this video and consider showing up to support them if you can.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQwgG01JeRg

The discussion with Intelligence Report’s Paul Elam, Dean Esmay and Dr. Tara Palmatier starts at 3 PM Pacific, 5 Central and 6 Eastern.

Title: MANstream Media: The Death of Robin Williams
Date: 2014-08-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=4ZyKZPrlFs0
Description: Robin Williams was one of the greatest entertainment artists of modern times. A brilliant comic and Oscar winning actor, he had a multi-generational impact on a society that fell in love with his work. By accounts of those close to him, he was a loyal friend, a generous and often troubled soul.

His life ended tragically at the age of 63, when he hanged himself alone in a bedroom in his California home.

Mainstream media coverage of the event has been expectedly shallow and sensational, leaving many more questions than answers for those who actually want to know what took the great entertainer down, and ultimately took him out.

Please join us today on MANstream Media, as Dr. Warren Farrell, Tom Golden and Paul Elam take a look at the life and death of Robin Williams. We start today at 4 p.m. Pacific, 6 Central and 7 Eastern Time.

Title: Going Mental: How Borderlines and Narcissists Abuse Facebook and Other Social Media
Date: 2014-08-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=BVxmJwmDcos
Description: It’s hard to believe that less than a decade ago, most people didn’t have Facebook or Twitter accounts. In a very short time, social media has had a tremendous impact on individuals, communities and nations. I mean, what did stay-at-home moms do before Facebook?

Social media can be benign, for instance, helping family and friends stay in touch, organizing communities, organizing and promoting events, special interest groups, business promotion, raising awareness about social issues and exposing corporate or political corruption. In the wrong hands, however, social media can be a very efficient weapon for both the personal and political.

Feminists effectively use social media to silence and oppress anyone that expresses feminist counter-theory or plain old disagreement. They run their ill-conceived ideological campaigns on social media like #BanBossy, #BringBackOurGirls and #YesAllWomen, just to name a few. Certain feminists and feminist groups also use social media to target specific individuals with false rape allegations or to just slander individuals who speak out against feminism by labeling them rape apologists and misogynists.

Similarly, Crazy (a high-conflict Borderline, Narcissist, Histrionic, Sociopath or UFC [Unidentified Form of Crazy]) uses social media to target her objects of hate — e.g., ex-husband(s), ex-boyfriend(s), current partner, new wife or girlfriend of an ex, colleagues, friends, and people she’s never met. Typical objects of hate are basically anyone who makes her feel bad about herself and her behavior, anyone who gets in her way and/or anyone she fears will expose her true nature.

For Crazy, social media websites are an endless source of attention, self-promotion, self-aggrandizement and a sophisticated weapon. Many narcissists, histrionics, borderlines and other self-obsessed, abusive personality types use Facebook, Twitter and the like to run smear campaigns, to make false allegations, to perpetrate parental alienation and to stalk and harass their targets while simultaneously portraying themselves as the much maligned victim, superwoman and/or mother of the year.

Join Dr Tara Palmatier of Shrink4Men.com and Paul Elam of AVoiceForMen.com on Wednesday, August 13, 2014 at 7:15 pm EDT, 6:15 pm CDT and 4:15 pm PDT as they discuss how Crazy uses and abuses Facebook and other social media and how you can protect yourself if you are in her cross hairs, especially during a divorce and/or custody battle.

Title: Going Mental: Does Your Teenager Treat You Like Your Crazy Ex Did?
Date: 2014-08-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-XzFcdkUJQQ
Description: When most of us think of parental alienation(PA), we think of the removal of children from the lives of their fathers; of kids being brainwashed into thinking ill of dad, and slowly being poisoned into emotional distance and even hatred.?r>
All of this is true. However, one of the things not as often discussed about PA is when children, particularly during adolescence, begin emulating the abusive treatment of the alienating mother.?r>
Teenagers who treat the father like he is an emotional dumping ground, shoveling out disrespect in the same way modeled by mom often still maintain the expectations that dad will act as a selfless provider. He is expected to either open up his wallet on demand or drop whatever he is doing in life to attend to desires for which they have not bothered to plan in advance.

Failure to comply often results in more hostility and more demonization. Sadly, alienated fathers often cave in to this kind of abuse and manipulation and are rarely if ever rewarded for it.

Yes, teenagers can be abusers, just like the crazy ex wife.
Please join Dr. Tara Palmatier and Paul Elam for the next episode of Going Mental, when we talk about what you do when your teenager is treating you like your ex did when you were married.?r>
The program starts on Wednesday, August 5 at 4pm EDT, 3pm CDT and 1pm PDT

There is some stuff flying all over twitter right now, carrying with it the implication that David Futrelle wrote material back in the 90’s that was just a little too much on the defensive side of a movie that graphically depicted the brutal sexual torture of children, including some acts that we won’t even say on this website.

Some people have implied that he is endorsing child sexual abuse. 

We have done some digging and will give you our impressions of what we think about that. We also stumbled on some other material from Futrelle on victims of DV violence. 

All we will say now is that it was a very interesting read.

Also, on Intelligence Report, we will be talking about the story of a woman who was asked not to breast feed her child in the middle of a middle school, and a man who wanted to get his fiancé a nice ring so bad that he robbed her bank for the money.

Dean Esmay will be off, taking care of family medical matters, so Dr. Tara Palmatier and Paul Elam will be doing the show on Monday, August 4 at 3:00 pm Central time 4 Eastern

Title: Going Mental: Borderline Personality Disorder Enablers and Apologists
Date: 2014-07-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=r4ZXjkhqIHM
Description: New AVFM Google Group! https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/110922307279187224775?cfem=1

There are therapists who specialize in treating individuals with characterological disorders who are realistic about the prognosis and, depending on the severity of the case and commitment to change, can help an individual with these problems, such as Borderline Personality Disorder, develop better impulse control, reality testing and how to consider other's feelings and needs if only to avoid the consequences of not doing so (e.g., the loss of an important relationship).

Then there are therapists who can best be described as BPD enablers and apologists. They tell the BPD individual and her or his significant other, who is often on the receiving end of tremendous emotional, psychological, financial and/or physical abuse, that the BPD's partner must learn to practice "radical acceptance" because the individual with BPD can't control themselves and doesn't know what they're doing. They insist that the BPD’s victims need to be more understanding and empathetic of their abuser's pain.

Unfortunately, a lot of these therapists provide services to those seeking marriage and family therapy, and it appears the bad ones far outnumber the good ones.

This attitude toward BPD individuals as victims, even when they're perpetrating egregious abuse, is also rampant on a number of support sites that supposedly exist as resources for men and women who are being abused by spouses, boyfriends/girlfriends, friends and family members with BPD.

They are quite literally sending the message that the victims of personality disordered abusers need to react that that abuse by making themselves vulnerable to more of the same.

There is very little open discussion of just how dangerous these therapists and “support groups” are to the victims of personality disordered abusers. It is important for people to know how to spot this problem in professionals, and in supposed support groups. It is the only chance they have of obtaining help from people who are actually interested in ending abuse rather than perpetuating it.

Join co-hosts Dr. Tara Palmatier, PsyD and AVFM’s Paul Elam on Wednesday, July 30, 2014 at 4pm EDT, 3pm CDT and 1pm PDT when they will discuss the problem of therapy that feeds psychopathology.

Date: 2014-07-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=8d1EKc8SjhM
Description: Human beings are social, pair-bonding creatures. In so many words, that is what we do.

Many men, on the other hand, take impulse to pair bond and turn it into a willingness to be a doormat with a wallet, often in exchange for what appears to be a small amount of acceptance from a woman.

Even worse, more than a few men accept abusive, opportunistic leeches disguised as women and hang on to them for dear life, even as it leads to their own destruction.

And yes, of course, not all men are like that. But there is enough of them to keep a steady stream of victims rolling straight into family court hell, year after year.

Please join your hosts Dr. Tara Palmatier, Paul Elam and special guest Tom Golden today at 3 PM Central, 4 Eastern for another edition of Going Mental, where we will bend over backwards to figure out why men just keep bending over for women.

Title: Intelligence Report: #womenagainstfeminism, Man Stabs Watermelon. Ricin, Shoot or be Shot
Date: 2014-07-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NNWOMKTaEHk
Description: Intelligence Report is back (though we sometimes wonder why we chose that name for the show.)

Today, feminists male and female alike and around the world are horrified by the trending #womenagainstfeminism hashtag. All are trying to mansplain or femsplain away the fact that the vast majority of women do not identify as feminists.

Also, a man gets arrested for stabbing a watermelon, a woman gets arrested and sentenced to 18 years in prison for sending president Obama, among other people letters laced with the poison ricin.

Finally, a man did not ejaculate enough to make his girlfriend happy, so she shot him.

On today's show, Paul Elam, Dr. Tara Palmatier and Dean Esmay will explore why the watermelon had it coming, why it was really a man who made the woman try to kill the president and since he would not shoot, she had every right to.

The carnage starts at 3:00 pm Central time 4 Eastern

Description: Michael Volpe is an investigative journalist, a trade he defines as "someone who inserts themselves in a situation someone somewhere wants kept hidden, and they report on that."'

Volpe is not new to the job description. He has written two books and is working on a third. This one involves men who have committed suicide or come near it after being sent through the meat grinder of family court.

This latest effort put him squarely in the path of Chris Mackney, a Virginia man who took his own life at the end of last year after a particularly nasty dose of what that court system could do with the wrong people pulling strings and spending money.

Join us tonight at 7:00 PM Central as Paul Elam interviews Michael Volpe and we dig a little deeper into the story behind the story that ended in Chris's untimely death, and the forces that were at work behind it.

Title: Going Mental: Guerrilla Divorce Strategies and Administrative Violence for Men Divorcing Crazy
Date: 2014-07-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=C8y0DMWhhb0
Description: Please join co-hosts Dr. Tara Palmatier and Paul Elam with special guest Sergeant First Class Terrence Popp this Thursday, July 17, 2014 at 8pm EDT, 7pm CDT, and 5pm PDT.

Divorcing an abusive, high-conflict, pathologically entitled woman (i.e., Crazy) can be a brutal experience. This type of personality will use any means necessary to "win," including false allegations of domestic violence and sexual violence, restraining order abuse, smear campaigns, delay tactics to drive up legal costs and to avoid consequences for their own malfeasance, parental alienation, child abuse, financial fraud, and a host of other predations.

Make no mistake; you're at war with an individual who wants to destroy you emotionally, psychologically, financially, socially, professionally and physically. She most likely wants total control over the children and may even wish to see you imprisoned. Many men have a difficult time accepting this and resist using maximalist legal means to neutralize the threat their exes pose to them and their children.

But she's the muther mother of my children.

She'll get angry with me if I expose her or hold her accountable.

I want to keep things as amicable as possible.

But I'm a nice guy.

The judge will be fair.

But she's the mother of my children. What kind of mother tries to destroy the children's father? What kind of mother depicts the children's father as a violent monster for a fatter child or spousal support check or just out of pure malice? What kind of mother teaches the children to hate and fear their father because she either doesn't value the importance of having a loving, involved father and/or is so insecure that she believes the children loving and having a relationship with their father means the kids love her less? Birthing children does not automatically bestow virtue. This kind of mother eats her young. You need to get over the sentimental veneration of "motherhood."

She'll get angry with me if I expose her or hold her accountable. And that would be different from what you experienced in your marriage how? Crazy uses her anger as a control mechanism. You're afraid of taking care of yourself and your children. You're afraid of looking after your best interests and the children's interests. This is what Crazy wants because it makes you an easier target. She's going to be angry no matter what you do because that is her nature, so you may as well do what's good for you.

I want to keep things as amicable as possible. Not possible if you are dealing with Crazy. Treating this kind of individual kindly and generously usually just makes them greedier and crueler. They view kindness as a weakness to be exploited.

But I'm a nice guy. Being a nice guy is not synonymous with being a doormat. When divorcing Crazy, it's time to stop being the nice guy and become the smart guy.

The judge will be fair. If you're a man who believes this, we have some land to sell you in Florida. If you're a man in family court, you begin with a severe handicap and you will need to figure out how to minimize it.

If you're divorcing an abusive, entitled, high-conflict and/or personality disordered woman and have any of the above mindsets, you are the proverbial lamb to the slaughter. You need to check your chivalry, put away your white steed and white hat, disabuse yourself of any notion of fairness in family court and do what you need to do within the bounds of the law. And that means being willing to expose your ex for the horrible person and parent she is.

These are just some of the topics we'll be covering on this week's Going Mental. Our guest, Sgt. Popp, will discuss specific divorce strategies he has seen men use and the practice of administrative violence as a way to combat the disadvantage many men face in Family Court.

Sgt. Popp is the founder of SecondClassCitizen.org, a non-profit promoting equal rights for non-custodial parents and children, and Redonkulas.com, a video site that offers off-color, in-your-face comedy on a range of topics including divorce, the dangers of dating and marrying crazy, feminism, female narcissism and entitlement, and stupid male relationship behaviors.

Sgt. Popp has produced two videos on this topic. If you're at work, you may want to turn down the volume or plug in your headset as some of the language isn't exactly office appropriate.

Title: Intelligence Report: Woven Digital Media Weaving Lies
Date: 2014-07-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=TJ6DPGWo3Os
Description: Perhaps the most humorous event in recent history was in watching members of the mainstream media short circuit their tiny little brains as they attempted to gather in and process the collective lifetimes of thoughtful counter-theory on gender and power at the First International Conference on Men's Issues.

The aftermath was reminiscent of the movie Tombstone. when Val Kilmer, playing Doc Holiday, stood over the body of Johnny Ringo (Michael Bein) after shooting him in the head in a duel. He uttered softly, "The strain was more than he could bayah."

We similarly look now over the carcass that so many writers across the mainstream media made of journalistic integrity after taking dead aim and blowing its brains out.

The First International Conference on Men's Issues was an astounding, groundbreaking success, history in the making. In its wake is promise for the future and, we think, and the day that journalism officially died.

Oh, we know the death rattle for the MSM has been sounding for some time. Still there has been no other example in recent history where so many members of the mainstream press simultaneously, and we think without conscious collusion, lied themselves straight into a pine coffin.

Join Paul Elam, Dr. Tara Palmatier, Dean Esmay (or is it John Ribner?) today at 1 Pacific, 3 Central and 4 Eastern for the post conference return of Intelligence Report, brought to you by A Voice for Men and Shrink 4 Men.

Description: http://www.avoiceformen.com/misandry/sycophants/on-journalism-and-bucky-turco/ Bucky Turco of Animal New York (a property of Woven Digital - http://woven.com/company.php ) , with his thoughts on "badly behaved" autistic kids and supposedly subservient women and other crack reporting. Now with improved sound quality for those who couldn't hear! (Still no editing, first few seconds chopped off by recording software not us, but that's old Bucky.) Turns out Bucky is the founder of Animal New York. Wonder if the other editors and contributors are embarrassed to work with him now?

We searched the world for an honest reporter, and finally found one when Bucky Turco of Animal New York, called Dean Esmay in response to a few tweets where he got made fun of for making a few basic errors we asked him to correct that he wouldn't. We must assume Dean had to immediately bathe after having the conversation with this yellow piece of shit.

Title: Paul Elam Debates Matt Binder

Description: On July 4, Matt Binder broadcast some commentary in a video entitled "The Insane Things Said at the 1st Annual Men's Rights Conference" on Sam Seder's video channel.

Doubtetree Letter http://www.avoiceformen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/07/AVFM-Security-Letter.pdf

Paul Elam took exception to what Binder had to say and issued a challenge for him to support his commentary in a debate.

Mr. Binder accepted.

Tomorrow, July 10, 2014 at 6 PM Eastern Time, Matt Binder and Paul Elam will square off in a debate here on the AVFM platform. The exchange should be brisk and interesting, with each participant being given brief, uninterrupted blocks of time, to assert and support their ideas.

It will be moderated by AVFM operations manager Dean Esmay, who has committed to fully impartial management of the debate. He will offer no opinions of his own, and indeed will be there simply to introduce the debate, the speakers and keep time. He is expected, and we are sure he will follow through, to moderate the debate and enforce rules without passion or prejudice.

We want to acknowledge that Mr. Binder has made quite a concession to agree to do this debate in a venue that has the potential for bias. AVFM management is pledged to ensuring that he gets fair treatment, exactly according to the promises we made him when arranging the debate.

Title: Going Mental: What is a Healthy Relationship?
Date: 2014-07-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=KNPANO_2VMA
Description: OK, so most guys by now actually know what crazy looks like. It can project blame at the speed of light. It wrinkles its brow and scratches its head at any request for personal accountability. It thinks good communication is defined by you shutting up and listening. It is insulted by your boundaries and will make you pay for trying to have any.

It does a lot of other stuff, too, that makes crazy, well, crazy.

But what does healthy look like? What, in this day and age, constitutes a healthy relationship between a man and a woman?
It is a big old tough question to handle, but that is just the kind of thing that people like Paul Elam and Dr. Tara Palmatier like to take on. And they will be doing that today on the return of Going Mental.

They have been on break leading up to the First International Conference on Men's Issues, but party time is over. It's time to get your mental on!

Today, 3PM Pacific, 5 Central, 6 Eastern

Title: Angry Harry on the International Conference on Men's Issues
Date: 2014-07-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=GwSarqvFbtk
Description: As I said in the panel discussion that concluded AVFM's First International Conference on Men's Issues, Angry Harry is the one individual who showed us, long before most ever dreamed of it, just how powerful the internet would become in the battle to bring consciousness of men's rights into the public arena.

He was right as rain, and we all owe him a huge debt for his brilliance and forward thinking.

This makes me especially proud to announce that Harry has begun a regular podcast series on the men's movement, which he plans to do about once every fortnight (for us Texans, that's two weeks).

In this inaugural broadcast, Harry considers the significance of the recent International Conference on Men's Issues, some corrective historical perspective on such conference and some invaluable advice for how MRAs can make sure that what happened last week actually becomes a pivotal moment in our history.

I cannot strongly enough suggest that we listen to him, one and all.

Harry's future programs will be available on AVFM's Live 365, our Youtube Channel and on this website.

At this critical point in our history, it is very encouraging to know that Harry's voice will remain at the core of what we do.

People think their soldiers return home to parades. I know better. And it's time you all learn.

This is the reason for veteran suicides. Broken families. Broken homes. Children legally kidnapped from their capable fathers due to bitterness and hatred from a failed marriage. When you rip children away from their parents, you commit the soul murder of two human beings: The child who will never know the true fullness of life, and the parent who loses their deepest connection with their kid.

This is the definitive director's cut of "Purple Heart's Final Beat," color corrected and improved from its original version with a new introduction.

Suicide statistics gathered and verified by CBS.
All end statistics were verified and collected by a 20-year combat veteran sergeant in the US Army. Non-public records were used in the gathering of these statistics.
The federal government does not acknowledge the true numbers and its own statistics do not include Coast Guard, Reserve or National Guard. The public figure of 4.3% veteran divorce rate released is a cover up by the Pentagon. After all, if the standard rate for the population is 50%, how could there be such a drastic difference?

Anger is a valid emotion and part of the spectrum of emotions men should be allowed to express. And we live in a world where blue collar, working men, homeless men, and men in need of help are often invisible. Warren's introduction and Paul's speech.

Our 4th speaker, Mike Buchanan of Justice 4 Men and Boys (& the Women Who Love Them) on how to get political. The counterintuitive strategy? If you're left wing, go after lefties hostile to boys and men, and if you're right wing, go after right wingers hostile to men and boys. In other words, challenge the people who agree with you on other things to take men's and boys' issues seriously!

What does Elliot Rodger, E3 and Harassment at Comic Con have in common? We don't know, probably nothing but we'll explore these topics anyways on Tales From The Infrared.

Eliot Rodger is now being called a nerd and the whole of nerd culture is under attack because of it.

E3 has ended and the amount of news could fill 4 TFTI broadcasts, but we'll go into the most important advancements showcased on stage.

Does comic con have a harassment problem? With so many female nerds willing to cosplay as "sexy" versions of their favorite video game, comic book or anime characters it's hard to say. When a hot dog cooks itself and jumps into the bun it's hard to argue against it.

Today, your hosts Dean Esmay, Tara Palmatier and Paul Elam will be covered another trio of stories falling from the sky of the modern gender zeitgeist.

We start with fathers being the best known antidote to the wacky world of helicopter parenting.

We also have a story on the astronomic increase in incarcerations in the United States and the severe impact this is having on the society at large.

Finally, an overview of the "Raw Story" and their coverage of the men's rights movement, as well as other media players and how they have spun the issues coming out of the starting gate.

The fun starts right here at 1 pm Pacific, 3 Central and 4 Eastern Time.

Date: 2014-05-02

Description: Men's advocates have a very perplexing problem. Many of them are very passionate about justice for everyone in a society that wrongly thinks it is pursuing that very thing; a society that is willing to practice a lot of injustice to prove it.

We literally live in a world that tells us we are nuts and monsters for seeing people in pain and trying to stop it from happening.

It stings even more that many of the men and women (yes, mostly the men) in this movement have had their lives irrevocably harmed because of the very problems they are trying help other people avoid and solve.

Pretty good recipe for anger.

And for a discussion.

It is time for another edition of MANstream Media Monthly, With Dr. Warren Farrell, Tom Golden and Paul Elam.

This month we are tackling the issue of anger, a long alleged problem for too many activists depending on who you are talking to. We will explore whether this is true. And to whatever extent it is, what we can or should do about it.

We start Thursday, May 1, at 7:00 PM Eastern Time.

Title: IR: Teacher Lap Dances, Principal Harrasses and Wendy Williams Cheers Paternity Fraud
Date: 2014-04-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=zssJ2hET6QM
Description: Once more unto the breach, dear friends.

As we do every Monday, your superhero trio of tabby tasters push their way into the muck and mire of mainstream life, bringing you stories and opinion through the red pill lens.

Today, a school teacher gives her underage male student a lap dance for his birthday. Of course she did it in front of the class.

And while that teacher was abusing her position (and her student) another schoolboy found himself in his female principal's office, being interrogated and harangued for "sexual harassment," of another student, which of course he did not do.

Then there is the case of one woman advising another to trick her husband into unknowingly getting her pregnant. Oh yes, the suggestion came from talk show host Wendy Williams, on her program, and was supported by the cheers and claps of almost all the women in the audience.

Yep, another day in the world of gender insanity, and we will walk you through to the other side of it.

Intelligence Report, from AVFM and Shrink4men.com. Today at 1 Pacific, 3 Central and 4 Eastern right here.

Description: Last week, I had the pleasure of interviewing Janet Bloomfield, aka JudgyBitch of judgybitch.com. It was a fun interview that gave Janet's many fans the opportunity to get to know this remarkable person a little better. You can view it here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVjQ1OLTsWk'

Soon after we had that interview Janet came up with the idea that she wanted to interview me, which of course is my honor. In fact, she has decided she wants to do a series of interviews with some of the principle parties involved with the International Conference on Men's Issues.

http://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/avfm-is-hosting-international-conference-on-mens-issues/

Better still, she wants to do these interviews with several prominent people on a regular basis leading up to the conference, which she will be attending.

We are going to kick that off today with her interview of me, here on a Google Hangout.

The fun begins at 1 Pacific, 3 Central and 4 Eastern time. Please join us with your comments and questions.

Title: GM: Even After Death She is Using Court to Silence Him
Date: 2014-04-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=meOY49_4q_0
Description: As has just been reported on AVFM, we have been contacted with a demand to remove information relating to a man who killed himself directly related to his alienation from his children and his abuse by the court and by his former wife.

It is a story that is crazy enough to qualify for an episode of Going Mental.

Your hosts, Dr. Tara Palmatier and AVFM Founder Paul Elam will be discussing this tragedy and the ongoing crisis created by our current system of family law, which clearly contributes to predominately male suicide.

The show airs today at 4 PM Central, 5 Eastern here on AVFM. Please feel free to join us with questions and comments.

Title: IR: Women's Prison, Rapey Lady Lawyer and a Convenient Assault
Date: 2014-04-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=bZD_jubS1HU
Description: Today's Intelligence Report covers a trio of stories from the ever deepening insanity of modern culture.

With a story out of Seattle we will be talking about women in prison and the abusive men who make them do terrible things to get there.

http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2022187282_womensprisonxml.html

We will also talk about a lady lawyer who could not keep her hands off the cabbie, and did not know that no meant no.

http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=010_1397609885#GygiaGXqXBeaYtiY.99

Finally there is Danielle D'Entremont, the Queens University feminist who was mysteriously (and allegedly) attacked by an MRA who is nowhere to be found. Coincidentally, and we know you will not believe this, but her "assault" happened right at the same time that feminists at that university were looking for a way to de-ratify the men's issues group there.

What an amazing coincidence.

Comics

DC Comics next summer blockbuster. Or the death of the New 52?
http://www.newsarama.com/20838-dc-comics-teases-futures-end-and-red-skies.html

Why should we care?

Since the new 52 came out, DC comics has been steadily dropping in sales on their titles. This would be a good opportunity for DC to move back into the previous version of the characters. As a longtime fan, that would be my choice. But as always, DC is very tight lipped on what the whole of the Future's End holds in store, but we do know that there are many signs pointing to some massive shake up of the DC universe. Including the fact that Future's End has talked about trying to avoid a war. Possibly a multiversal war?

What I know for sure is that this is definitely something to watch, especially since it could lead into next summer, which is the 30th anniversary of the original Crisis on Infinite Earths.

Technology

Goggle Glass Targeted as symbol by anti-tech crowd

http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/14/tech/mobile/google-glass-attack/index.html

Why should we care?

In the MHRM, we have a saying: Always be recording. And with Google glass, this would make activism possible on a single person level, because people could record everything, and send it straight to another device. This would make on the ground activism much easier, and safety of activists a lot better. However, this also has some criticisms, due to people not wanting to be recorded. And this has led to attacks of individuals who are wearing the device. Specifically of people stealing the Google Glass right off people's faces, and in one case, smashing them.

Still, at $1500 for the thing, I am pretty sure the average person is going to have to wait to get their hands on them. Of course, my advice about any new technology is to wait at least 8-12 months before purchasing it. Let the company actually work the majority of the bugs out, and hopefully drop the price by quite a bit.



Google buys drone maker Titan Aerospace

http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/14/technology/innovation/google-titan-drone/index.html



Drones in the hands of Google and Facebook? Why does this sound like the plot of a movie from the 80's and 90's? If you don't know what movies I am talking about, I will refer you to The Terminator and Terminator 2. And with Google also purchasing other tech companies, including Nest and Boston Dynamics, it seems rather strange that all these things might be put together in such a fashion.

Normally I wouldn't be one for any type of conspiracy theory, but it really is suspicious as to why a tech company that is so successful, would be investing so heavily in drones, robots, and self-driving cars. It really strikes me as odd, unless they are thinking of trying to do something that goes far beyond something altruistic.

Title: Not So Impromptu MRA Discussion - 2014-04-17

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7OBesYke-nA
Description: A fun night Included Judgy Bitch, Al Martin The Man On The Street, James Huff, Rachel Edwards, Lucian Valsan, Kristal Garcia, Hannah Wallen, and more. Topics of discussion include:

1) Melody Hensley's super scary PTSD and how she damsels to shut down discussion with which one disagrees.

2) Adele Mercier and how she uses biased research, false stats and false claims to promote a feminist agenda, and then uses borrowed credibility (academia) as a means of attempting to marginalize dissenting viewpoints.

3) The segment on the 640AM Oakley show from this morning that starred Susan Cole of the Canadian NOW and how her and her cohorts advocate against free speech and embrace the use of governing authority to silence dissent.

4) Cathy Young and how she continues to use shaming tactics to silence dissent and possibly competition for an audience.

Of course this will be a call in show! MRAs are encouraged to join me tonight on Live365 at 8PM Central Time. The chat room will be open.

Addendum: Well folks, looks like we just got ourselves a bonus round for tonight's show. We are adding a topic of discussion!!

Description: Today at 1 PM Pacific, 3 PM Central and 4 Eastern, Paul Elam will be doing an interview with Janet Bloomfield, much more popularly known as JudgyBitch; blogger, honey badger, mother, wife, doctoral candidate, and all around general badass.

When JudgyBitch speaks, feminists put their fingers in their ears and start screeching because they cannot take the pain of unvarnished truth. So consider that a trigger warning for feminists. DO NOT WATCH THIS INTERVIEW! It will trigger all of your triggers and then leave you with new triggers in places you did not know you could have them.

But for those on the side of reason, intelligence and figuratively slapping around idiots with stupid ideas, today we have for you......entertainment.

Title: MANstream Media: Failure to Launch
Date: 2014-04-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=BlDXDQk302U
Description: For most young men their early twenties is a time when they are expected to move away from home; to individuate and find their way in the world more or less on their own.

There is a trend however, indicating that there is a growing percentage of young men who are experiencing "failure to launch," now a fairly popular cultural term. These young men are staying at home longer, under employed and unemployed, depending on their parents for survival.

There has been a great deal of speculation about the origin this phenomenon, including a bad economy and the ever lessening presence of young men in higher education, but as usual many social commentators and theorists rely on a negative model of men, or some men, to explain what is happening.

As Dr. Mark Banschick said in Psychology Today, "I have come to see the problem of failure to launch as being part of an avoidant generational style, at least in a sizable subgroup." That subgroup, of course, is predominately male. According to Banschick, "...our girls seem to be doing great."

Banschick goes on, of course, to recommend psychotherapy to treat the motivational problems as some sort of psychiatric disorder in young men.

But what is really happening in these young men? What could possibly motivate Banschick's "avoiders" to avoid? What could there possibly be about modern life for young men that makes them more prone to opt out of the normal path to "adulthood."

We invite you to join Dr. Warren Farrell, Tom Golden, LCSW and Paul Elam for a discussion on "failure to launch," on MANstream Media Monthly today, April 17, 2014 at 4 PM Pacific, 6 Central and 7 Eastern Time.

Title: Going Mental: Say Goodbye to Crazy
Date: 2014-04-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ppZ2mZzfPyo
Description: OK, so you just woke up, looked across the bed from you and saw a crazy woman lying there next to you. It is the same woman that had been lying there every morning for quite some time, but this time is different. This time you can clearly see the Crazy in her. You can see it in every line on her face, in each strand of her crazy hair; oozing from the crazy pores in her crazy skin. You can even smell it on her crazy breath each time she softly, crazily exhales.

The question becomes, "What do I do now that I know?"
And that is a question that must be answered carefully. Getting hooked up with Crazy is really, really, easy, especially in today's culture. Getting rid of her without resorting to the use of duct tape, plastic bags and shovels can get a lot more complicated.

Please be sure to join Dr. Tara Palmatier and Paul Elam today for the next episode of Going Mental, where we talk about how you "Say Good-bye to Crazy," hopefully while hanging on to your sanity and your assets.

All the crazy fun begins today at 1 PM Pacific, 3 Central and 4 Eastern Time.

Title: IR: Feminist Rapes her Wife, Boy Busted for Recording Bullies and AVFM Goes to Maine
Date: 2014-04-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=dKeos8zvSl0
Description: Well, it is Monday again, which means it is time for the Intelligence Report from Shrink4Men and A Voice for Men, with Dean Esmay, Paul Elam and Dr. Tara Palmatier.

This week we have a trio of stories that bounced off the rubber walls modern life and into our laps.

There is a boy who recorded his bullies psychologically and physically abusing him in the presence of his teacher. And there were indeed consequences. The victim was charged with illegal wiretapping for recording his abusers!

Next, we have "Teach Feminists Not to Rape," as we cover the story of a transgender feminist activist who has been charged with the rape of her former wife.

Last, AVFM is headed back to Ellsworth, Maine, this time in person to speak at a rally targeting the injustice and corruption that has long been a cottage industry for prosecutors in the Hancock and Washington County Prosecutors office headed by Carletta Bassano.

All this and more will be on the chopping block of truth on today's edition of the Intelligence Report at 1 PM Pacific, 3 Central and 4 Eastern Time.

Title: Paul Elam interviews Alison Tieman

Description: Today at Noon Pacific, 1 PM Mountain, 2 Central and 3 Eastern Time, Paul Elam will be conducting a special interview with writer, artist, videographer and men's advocate Alison Tieman, also known as Typhon Blue.

Tieman has already left an important legacy in the men's human rights movement with her stellar examinations of gender roles, causing many of us, even the old timers, to rethink our approach to the problems we address in this movement with an improved understanding.

Some of her most prominent work has been on debunking both myths and bad research methodology on rape and what is now called "rape culture."

For some time she has been a "go to" source when AVFM has been contacted by Canadian media, serving as a knowledgeable and articulate spokesperson for the men's movement.

Today we will be talking about Alison's work, and about many of the recent events in Canada which have made the news concerning the men's movement and the feminist backlash that has ensued.

Title: Going Mental: Negotiating the Minefield of Mental Health Services
Date: 2014-04-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=OauU81KE6GA
Description: Men have quite a dilemma when it comes to seeking mental health services.

Whether they are going through a life crisis like divorce, trying to salvage a marriage that is falling apart or other personal problems they are faced with a mental health community that is literally crawling with ideologically trained "professionals" who fail to understand men's issues and are more prone to worsen men's plight rather than help.

Often, these practitioners are people steeped in the same bigotry and hateful ideas as we have recently witnessed from academicians like Adele Mercier.

It effectively puts men in trouble in a minefield while they are looking for help.

On today's edition of Going Mental, Paul Elam and Dr. Tara Palmatier will be joined by Licensed Clinical Social Worker Tom Golden, a long time men's advocate with many years of experience counseling men going through life changes and other stress and emotional trauma.

The program will air here, at A Voice for Men, at 4 Pacific Time, 6 Central and 7 Eastern.

Title: IR: Is Ad? Mercier a victim blaming rape and molestation apologist?
Date: 2014-04-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=knAXFv3lc68
Description: To say that Professor Ad? Mercier stumbled into a hotbed of criticism is an understatement. Sure, by outward appearances she tripped over the coffee table and landed face-first on the living room floor completely by accident.

But looks can be deceiving. It may be that Ad? Mercier is a victim of her own hubris.

After making public statements that most MHRAs and other reasonable people equate to rape and molestation apologia, victim blaming and hateful speech, it seems she has set about trying to remove all evidence of her words from the internet, including a formal, written demand to AVFM that remove any opinionating about her beliefs from our pages.

This, of course, just piqued our interest more in the Queen's University Professor of Philosophy and has earned her singular billing as a topic on today's episode of Intelligence Report from AVFM and Shrink4men.com.

Please join us today at 1 PM Pacific, 3 PM Central and 4 PM Eastern Time today for Dean Esmay, Dr. Tara Palmatier and Paul Elam reviewing the case of the modern professor who never heard of male rape victims, or Barbara Streisand.

Date: 2014-04-02

Description: Going Mental with Dr Tara Palmatier and Paul Elam: Recognizing Crazy's Red Flags

Many men are able to avoid becoming involved with unstable, entitled, abusive, empathically challenged, manipulative, emotionally immature, personality disordered and/or sociopathic women. Perhaps they had loving parents who taught them to respect and love themselves enough to not be tempted by the siren song of Crazy.

Then there are men who are less fortunate, plenty of them, who have to learn the hard way how to detect, avoid and break themselves of their attraction to Crazy. Some of these men were parentified and abused by their mothers. From an early age they were groomed to think abuse is normal. Some were raised by loving, well-intentioned but completely clueless parents who taught them men are honor bound to protect women, treat all women with respect (no matter how unwarranted) and to make women happy at all costs.

Today's Going Mental is for the men who are still learning how to spot the good eggs from the bad ones -- recognizing early warning signs and red flags.

The program will begin at 3pm EDT, 2pm CDT, 1pm MDT and 12pm PDT.

Description: Today's Intelligence Report (formerly Monday Roundup) will once again feature Paul Elam, Dr. Tara Palmatier and Dean Esmay. As a special guest, AVFM Director of Collegiate Activism and kindred kitten chomper Sage Gerard will be joining us for another ideology bang sesh, looking at feminist governance and some of the really stupid things it brings with it.

We will be covering, in no particular order, the CAFE sponsored lecture by Janice Fiamengo that turned into a feminist drum circle. Also, Muffpo feminist blogger Anne Theriault explains why the MHRM is a bunch of garbage, by spouting a lot of garbage. In fairness we must add Troy Patterson in Slate saying gentlemen who do not pay attention to things people they trust tell them are awful so he pays no attention to the Men's Rights Movement (like a good puppy).

Also, Judge Cynthia Brim in Chicago was declared legally insane after assaulting a deputy sheriff, and now wants her job back. She might just get it, too.

Finally, the city of Glendale, CA is going to provide sexual assault defense training, but only to the grrls, cause, you know, guys don't get raped.

The fun starts right here at 1PM Pacific, 3:00 Central and 4:00 Eastern Time.

Title: Interview with Julia Wong of Global News

Description: Men's Human Rights Activists recently created a firestorm by parodying misandrist "Don't Be That Guy" campaign. Global News contacted AVfM Operations Manager Dean Esmay on March 25 2014 to ask about the posters. Relevant links below. Note: We are not 100% certain Men's Rights Halifax put up these posters, we just inferred/guessed that it was them or someone associated with them, we do not know this to be true.

NOTE: SAVE in Edmonton is a terrible group of sexist bigots in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. We do not approve of their message. There is another group in the US in Washington DC, SAVE, which stands for Stop Abusive and Violent Environments, which does work which we do support. It's too bad SAVE in Washington has to share a name with this odious group in Edmonton.

Title: Going Mental: Abusive Women, Smart Men, Bad Choices
Date: 2014-03-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=M2KyHtFso0E
Description: Whatever your feelings about relationships, there is no doubt that men's lives with women can be both crazy and comical — sometimes both at the same time, sometimes not.

For a thousand arguable reasons, it is our relationship lives where logic often goes out the window and all things limbic have a way of taking over. That is true for both sexes, and it can have not only a profound impact on mental health, but on the lives of the people involved.

The world spends a nauseating amount of time obsessing on women's experience in this area. But, at the risk of sounding cliché, what about the men?

While more people are becoming aware of men's issues, they still suffer neglect.

Responding to that deficit is the aim of a new Hangout with Dr. Tara Palmatier and Paul Elam, "Going Mental," a program about how men experience modern relationships, good, bad or indifferent.

The show debuts on Wednesday, March 26 at 12 PM Pacific, 2 Central and 3 Eastern Time here on A Voice for Men.

The first program will include a brief discussion about the show, followed by a discussion between Paul and Dr. T on the reasons so many men make themselves unnecessarily vulnerable, emotionally and legally, to women; the failure of many men to establish and hold fast to limits with what they will tolerate, and why all of this happens.

We are also going to focus on what can be done about it.

Please feel free to join us as we explore the side of men that most people know about but few discuss.

Title: Intelligence Report: Feminist Violence, Feminist Lies
Date: 2014-03-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ikpzeXJj2So
Description: A couple of brief announcements about today's Monday Roundup. First, it will be on an hour earlier than usual, at noon Pacific, 2 Central and 3 Eastern Time.

And second, it is no longer the Monday Roundup. After several months of doing the program we decided we did not like the name, probably because roundup reminded non-Texans of where they weren't from, but 'nuff said on that.

Henceforth the weekly program, which will return to its regular time next week, will be called Intelligence Report with AVFM and Shrink4Men.

On today's show, we will be talking about the recent bullying, violence and thievery by a feminist professor at the University of California in Santa Barbara. Also, we have a story on tap out of Queen's College in Kingston, Ontario, where an attempt to de-ratify the school's Men's Issues Awareness Society was shut down cold by the Alma Mater Society Assembly.
Those and other stories will be discussed by Paul Elam, Dean Esmay and Dr. Tara Palmatier.

Join us!

Title: MANstream Media: It is Time to End "Rape Culture" Hysteria
Date: 2014-03-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=zSI1qJY65y0
Description: Rape culture, or the idea that we live in a society where the sexual assault and abuse of women by men is routinely condoned and normalized, has been an overarching concern and cause c?bre for gender ideologues for a number of years.

This is particularly true on our college campuses. So pervasive are the assertions of rape culture proponents, such as one in four female college students being sexually assaulted, that these ideas have emanated everywhere from small internet blogs to the Oval Office.
Valid research has never supported the existence of a rape culture, save perhaps in our penal institutions, but the myth about its larger existence has persisted.
Until now.

The Rape and Incest National Network (RAINN), the largest anti-sexual assault advocacy group in the US, recently issued a report advising the White House that rape is actually a criminal issue caused by a small minority of the population, and asserts that the crime is not a cultural condition.

Taking that even further, they have advised the White House that it needs to change the way it is directing institutions of higher education to handle sexual assault allegations on campus. This would include both increasing the involvement of the criminal justice system and de-emphasizing the use of college "honor courts" which have come under fire for the lack of due process that guides their activity.

Furthermore, they have advised schools to offer risk reduction educations to students in order to lessen the likelihood of a sexual assault to begin with.

All of these recommendations are a direct contradiction of many efforts by gender ideologues who have commandeered the public discourse on sexual assault and who have authored many policies on treatment of alleged incidents in modern academic settings.
The RAINN report signals a major, significant reversal of current trends in handling sexual assault and allegations of it.

Please join us today, March 22, 2014 at 3:00 PM Pacific, 5 Central and 6 Eastern Time for a Special Edition of MANstream Media Monthly, where Dr. Warren Farrell, Tom Golden and Paul Elam will discuss the RAINN report, and what it means to the future of sexual politics.

Title: Hanna Rosin: Autistic Boy Tortured, Mother Most Affected
Date: 2014-03-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=REYA8ZD0i1o
Description: Two young women in Maryland have admitted to torturing a 16 year old mentally disabled boy over a period of months, including putting a knife to his throat on several occasions, kicking him in the groin, forcing him to masturbate and have sex with animals, making him walk across a frozen pond where he fell into the icy water several times, dragging him around by his hair and other acts which they reportedly recorded on camera phones.?r>
Despite the fact that the mother of the autistic boy knew that he was associating with the two (and spending excessive amounts of money on one of them), she admits she had never bothered to meet either of them. Now the mother is afraid people will judge her for that.

So is Hanna Rosin.

Writing for Slate Magazine, Rosin empathizes with the Mother, not so much the tortured boy, crossing the line in writing what amounts to a series of scripted excuses for the maternal cluelessness.

"I feel her pain," says the End of Men author. "From the little we know of the mother, it sounds as if she had to work a full day."

Surely that left her no time at all to get to know anyone her mentally disabled son was spending time and money on.

Please join Dr. Tara Palmatier, Dean Esmay and Paul Elam on Monday, March 17, 2014 at 1 PM Pacific, 3 Central and 4 Eastern Time as we dedicate an entire program to this tragedy.

Title: Roundup: Has Congressman Alan Greyson stopped beating his wife?
Date: 2014-03-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=OXZPxDUaquc
Description: Well, here we are again, rapidly approaching another edition of AVFM Monday Roundup, with Paul Elam, Dr. Tara Palmatier and Dean Esmay.

The last week has delivered another smorgasbord of feminist craziness from which we have to narrow down matters to three items. So much crazy, so little time.

We will start with a bit of near sanity from none other than the New Republic, who serves up a trigger warning about trigger warnings.

From there we head to Kennesaw State University, where they have just finished celebrating "Love Your Body" week as one would expect most feminists to do, by avoiding any consciousness about your body.

Celebrating included covering up mirrors in the women's restrooms and ceremoniously smashing scales. Good to see they incorporated some exercise into their celebration.

We even have the benefit of having AVFM Director of Collegiate Activism, himself a KSU student, who had a conversation with a feminist dietitian who tells us that there is no such thing as good food or bad food. What matters is how you FEEL about what you eat.

Like we said, so much crazy, so little time.

Finally, we will be discussing the story of Congressman Alan Greyson, who slapped with a restraining order and accused by his estranged wife of assault.

Ho-hum. It must be the video of her assaulting him that that is lying, because we all know that women don't make these things up.

Join us Monday, March 10, 2014 at 1PM Pacific, 3 Central and 4 Eastern Time for the next edition of AVFM Monday Roundup!

Title: A Conversation with a Feminist Dietitian (Read Description)
Date: 2014-03-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=HscAWajTluo
Description: Pardon the background music. It could not be helped.

To give you some context, recently the students of Kennesaw State University celebrated "Love Your Body" week in which they made "statements" by covering up mirrors in women's restrooms and ceremoniously smashing scales. Apparently self-reality is just too much for some women to take.

AVFM's Director of Collegiate Activism, Sage Gerard, himself a KSU student, was at the event and encountered a registered dietitian who interpreted events though the feminist lens.

Apparently, according to this nutritional "expert," there is no such thing as good food or bad food. There is only how you FEEL about what you eat.

No, that is not a joke. She really said it. And a lot more.

Hope you get as many laughs listening to this whackaloon as I did. Also, if you have not subbed to Sages channel, it is worth it. His vids are excellent.

Title: MANstream Media: What do you mean "men's" issues?
Date: 2014-03-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=941MCbVg5fc
Description: It almost seems incredible. With a suicide rate of 4:1 vs women, 93% male workplace mortality, men falling out of education and employment at alarming rates, the corruption and anti-male bias of family courts, predominately male homelessness and a number of other problems we still live in a culture in which most people will scratch their heads and ask, "What do you mean men's issues?"

There is a number of reasons for this pervasive cultural ignorance, not the least among them is the mainstream media, which has been hammering in the message for decades now that men are bad and women are good; women important, men not.

MANstream Media is your monthly alternative to this unhealthy, dysfunctional programming, and on the next edition you can join your hosts Dr. Warren Farrell, Tom Golden and Paul Elam for an overview of the varied issues that are faced by modern men and boys.

We will be discussing the release of Dr. Farrell's 21st anniversary edition of the Myth of Male Power in ebook, and the upcoming International Conference on Men's Issues, and how the topics covered by both are among the most important issues faced by our society today.

Please join us on Thursday, March 6 at 4:00 PM Pacific, 6:00 PM Central and 7:00 PM Eastern for MANstream Media Monthly.

Title: New Republic Endorses AVFM, Valenti Explodes, and Yes, Women do Harass
Date: 2014-03-03

Description: Emily Matchar of the New Republic recently did a piece on the Men's Human Rights Movement. She got enough wrong to piss off some MHRAs. She got enough right to piss off Jessica Valenti. So in the end, it certainly was not the worst piece ever done on the movement.

http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116768/latest-target-mens-rights-movement-definition-rape

It was on target enough that it can be considered an endorsement, with qualifications, of course. At least it was one that inspired a tweetsplosion of anger from Valenti.

We will be discussing this story at length on this weeks AVFM Monday Roundup with Dr. Tara Palmatier, Dean Esmay and Paul Elam.

Also being given the red pill treatment will be the firing of a New York PR firm employee after HE made complaints of sexual harassment from a couple of his female bosses.

Title: Roundup: ABC 20/20 Returns to the MHRM, Doping Boys and CA SB 967
Date: 2014-02-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-seE_M1DzC4
Description: Is it Monday again already? Yep! And that means it is time again for AVFMs Monday Roundup with the kitten eating and endlessly oppressive trio of Elam, Esmay and Palmatier. The terrible threesome will each zero in on a current event with relevance to today's men and boys.

First, after a less than scrupulous attempt at "covering" the men's movement, a backlash from that and an online petition urging the media giant to start giving men's issues fairer treatment, ABC News 20/20 is now reaching out again the men's rights community.
This time, 20/20 producer Sean Dooley wants to talk to men who have been in physically abusive relationships. Dooley says they are "looking for a few brave individuals to come forward and discuss their experience."

Also, we have heard for some time the concerns about misdiagnosing ADHD in boys and doping them up at the behest of school counselors as a behavior management tool. Now, from the Wall Street Journal, which seems to be becoming the AVFM of the mainstream media, we have a story about another possible motive for the misuse of psychotropic drugs on school age boys. Test scores. It seems that some of these drugs improve scores, which of course is good for schools, and teachers unions.

http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304275304579392932032900744?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304275304579392932032900744.html

Finally, California, a state that often sets legislative trends for the rest of the nation, is literally trying to turn the "Dear Colleague Letter" into law for California Universities, putting the weight of the State Legislature into the end of due process. If the law is passed, it will effectively put the burden of proof of innocence on the accused, rather than place the burden of proof on school administrators.

SB 967 is poised to make an accusation tantamount to a conviction in every institution of higher education in the State of California.

Title: Roundup: Wellesley College Prude-a-thon, Pay CS Go to Jail and Dartmouth Crosses the Line
Date: 2014-02-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=rdKhLfyYYGo
Description: Today on AVFM's Monday Roundup, join Secret Agenda Editor Dean Esmay, Moderate Extremist Paul Elam and the ever traitorous Dr. Tara Palmatier of shrink4men.com for three different tall but true tales on gender insanity of the times.

First, there is the story of the guy who went to jail AFTER paying all of his child support.

Then there is the matter that even left Pierce Harlan of the Community of the Wrongly Accused nearly speechless. Amanda Childress, Sexual Assault Awareness Program coordinator at Dartmouth College thinks campus policies aren't going far enough to protect [female] students. "Why could we not expel a student based on an allegation?" she asks.

Indeed, Amanda, why should anyone need proof or due process in order to justify ruining a life? It's only men, after all.

And last, as if these first two stories were not enough, a sculpture of a man in his underwear at Wellesley College has hundreds of students at the all-female university of privilege standing on chairs a shrieking for someone to take it away. It feels rapey-creepy to them and should be dispensed with.

Link to image: http://i1.wp.com/www.avoiceformen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/02/Wellesley-college.jpg

Even Amanda Marcotte has stepped forward in brief moment of what appears to be sanity to tell the Wellesley Grrrls that they are being silly. We know, that is kind of like Pee-Wee Herman talking about the strangeness of Tiny Tim, but you get our drift.

Join us today for these three whackaloon offerings from the crazy world of gender justice, right here on AVFM at 1PM Pacific, 3PM Central and 4 Eastern Time.

Description: The New York Times crucified him. Jessica Valenti warns us against defending him because someone whistled at her ass when she was a teenager.

Femmy bloggers across the accuse-o-sphere are all wailing on Woody and screaming rape culture.

False accusation victim Woody Allen's story has exploded all over the news in the last week, so today the AVFM Monday Hangout will focus all of our attention on it.

Please join your hosts AVFM Founder and Evil Overlord Paul Elam, Red-headed labia traitor Dr. Tara Palmatier and ultra left-wing agenda driven right-wing nutcase Dean Esmay for a special AVFM Monday Hangout, Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Lying Personality Disordered Crazies * But Were Afraid to Ask.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=fgxkNtvh8BA
Description: Here we are at the start of another week and it is time for the AVFM Monday Roundup, with Dean Esmay, Tara Palmatier and Paul Elam.

This week a triad of tragic tales from the mainstream media, of course.

First up, a man gets 14 years in prison for sliding his girlfriend the "abortion pill." If she took it on her own, it is a woman's right to choose. He gives it to her without telling her, it's murder. Only in the modern west, folks.

http://www.lifenews.com/2014/01/27/man-who-killed-his-unborn-child-by-tricking-girlfriend-into-taking-abortion-drug-gets-14-years/

Also, Woody Allen's daughter Dylan has given a public account of her alleged sexual abuse at the hands of the Hollywood Icon. He's guilty, right? The media just convicted him.

http://variety.com/2014/film/news/woody-allens-adapted-daughter-dylan-farrow-gives-account-of-alleged-sexual-abuse-1201081907/

Finally, we have Jessica Valenti Back on the Scene with Back the Fuck Up, her new sloganeering effort to get people to get out of feminist's way so that they can get whatever they want.

http://www.thenation.com/blog/178005/back-f-protect-womens-rights-getting-out-way

Damn, and here we were thinking that motherhood might have taught the old dog some new tricks. Like perspective and humility. Wishful thinking: Not recommended.

That and a few other laughs are in store for you tomorrow, Monday, February 3, 2014 at 1 PM Pacific, 3 PM Central and 4 Eastern on AVFM Monday Roundup.

Title: MANstream Media Monthly with Warren Farrell, Tom Golden and Paul Elam: Valentines Day
Date: 2014-02-07

Description: Please like us on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/MANstreammediamonthly

We are proud to announce that on February 6, 2014 AVFM will launch a new monthly program on Google Hangouts. It's called MANstream Media Monthly.

Each month join your hosts Dr. Warren Farrell, Tom Golden, LCSW and AVFM Founder Paul Elam for a discussion of culture, news and current events that are of interest to men and women who care about what is happening to men and boys in this society, and who want to do something about it.

The show will provide honest and hard hitting analysis, as well as exploration of alternatives for men and women longing for something other than the man bad/woman good false paradigm that has dominated our culture for a half century to disastrous results.

Our first program, fittingly, will be a modern day Manstream look at Valentines Day, and why, if we are going to observe it at all, that we need a new idea of what it means. Hint for jewelers, this is not good news for you.

You can join us right here on Thursday, February 6, 2014 at 4:00 PM Pacific, 6:00 PM Central and 7:00 PM Eastern for the very first episode of Manstream Media Monthly, another first from A Voice for Men.

And of course, feminists have coopted the day in order to campaign against domestic violence (against women only)

Title: Anti Male Hysteria: From Nazarian to Obama
Date: 2014-01-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=AdjqKWQnNLA
Description: John Nazarian is a private (and quite frankly public) dick in California who specializes in helping his clients gather and even created dirt on their husbands during the process of a divorce.

He hit the weasel radar of A Voice for Men some time ago because of the Pauley Perrette restraining order scam, and then moved up the ladder of shame even more when we discovered that he was producing videos instructing women how to get their husbands thrown out of the house on false allegations of domestic violence.

Nazarian has now been named in grand jury complaints and in complaints to the licensing agency for California private investigators.

Meanwhile, the President of the United States is conducting business in similar fashion. Even after his administration played to rape hysteria with the scourge of the "Dear Colleague Letter," destroying a couple of centuries of due process principles on college campuses, he is now poised to launch a new Rape Hysteria Campaign.

From the White House website, the President said that we will "keep taking actions like strengthening the criminal justice system, reaching out to survivors, and changing social norms so that all Americans can feel safe and protected as they pursue their own piece of the American dream."

Oh, ya. Safe, safe, safe. All God's children are going to be safe. One way or the other.

Please join Shrink4men.com Leading Labia Traitor Dr. Tara Palmatier, AVFM Managing Kitten Eater Dean Esmay, the Overlord of All That is Unholy, Paul Elam, for AVFM's Monday Roundup, today at 3:00 PM Central, 4 Eastern, right here.

Title: Feminism vs Men's Rights Activism - using magnets
Date: 2014-01-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=A7e_rs-rf9I
Description: by AVfM's own Alison Tieman (Typhonblue)

Men's Rights activists seek to bring awareness to how men are acted upon by society, acted upon by other men and acted upon by women.

They are opposed by feminists who think that bringing attention to how men are acted upon will take something away from women.

Every era has had its mythology of women's weakness and men's strength. Ours is no different and it's not progressive.

How easy is it for you to see Jill as a victim? How hard is it for you to see Jack as vulnerable?

Title: Debate: Is Men's Rights a Left vs Right Issue? -- Paul vs Keyster
Date: 2014-01-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=LEQdSYwazNU
Description: Bernard Chapin has spent years chanting the mantra that "Men's Rights is a Left vs Right Issue," and launching cowardly attacks from the shielded safety of his tightly controlled YouTube channel against those who disagree. Naturally, he refused to engage in open debate about the issue in a live, unedited video format on Youtube with AVFM founder and publisher Paul Elam.

Bernard is not so certain about his ideas in a venue where he cannot censor dissent.

Quelle surprise.

Long time frequenter and sometimes formal contributor to the discussion on men's rights Keyster, however, has agreed to do what Chapin would not, and has picked up the glove that lay neglected and avoided at Bernard's feet (of clay).

He has agreed to participate in a structured, moderated debate with Paul Elam on the question, "Is Men's Rights a Left vs Right Issue?"

The debate will be hosted by AVFM Director of Media Operations James Huff, right here, live and unedited on Friday, January 24, 2014 @ 7 PM Central Time US.

Keyster will take the affirmative position. Elam will take the negative position.

To avoid any credible charge of bias, we are notifying viewers in advance that James Huff has been asked and has agreed to the following terms of his role as moderator.

The moderator will not inject any personal observations or opinions during the course of the debate at all. His function will be to introduce the debate topic, the participants, outline the structure and rules of the debate, and to act impartially as Sergeant at Arms to enforce the parameters of the debate.

He will call to order either participant breaking the rules.

The debate structure will be as follows:

Basic Rules

Both participants are on honor system. Both agree to abide by the pre-determined rules of the debate, and to support the debate process without interruptions or rule violations.

Ten minutes each opening statements. Paul and Keyster have agreed that Paul will go first.

Five minutes each follow up for rebuttals.

Question and Answer Rounds

Each participant will be allowed two questions, one at a time, to pose their opponent. Opponent will have 3 minutes to answer the question.

Questions will not be revealed to either opponent until they are posed in the live debate.

Closing statements, 5 minutes each.

Title: AVFM Monday Roundup: Black Man, Red Pill & Celebrating Martin Luther King, Jr.
Date: 2014-01-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=tFaJbgWaiCE
Description: Do Black men and other minorities get shafted deeper by traditionalist and feminist governance? Why was it rap artists that first came out with true Red Pill lyrics in their work? Why, after murdering her children, did Susan Smith think it would help her cover to claim that men of color were the real culprits?

And why do we see so many subtle forms of racism, including Islamophobia, woven throughout the rhetoric of femifascists?

Today, as we celebrate the life and works of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we will discuss this and more on AVFM's Monday Roundup.

Please join hosts Dr. Tara Palmatier of shrink4men.com, AVFM Managing Editor Dean Esmay and AVFM founder and publisher Paul Elam for a discussion on the Black Man and the Red Pill.

Title: What Part of Feminazi Do You Not Understand?
Date: 2014-01-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=rGlGylLRB3M
Description: Love Rush Limbaugh or hate him, when he coined the term "Feminazi," he hit the center of the bull's eye.

And Feminazi now clearly describes the public voice and actions of mainstream gender feminists. College professors now advocate the legalized murder of men. The Canadian Alliance of Student Associations has levied a prohibition against men's organizations that are not under feminist control. Feminists sought and now have the power of bald censorship of dissent on social media platforms like FaceBook. More recently the feminist assault has launched within the WordPress community, where as we speak "Community Standards" are being drafted that will ultimately tether WordPress sites to a feminist yoke.

Finally, after years of preparation and dedicated effort, the Male Studies initiative that was scheduled to launch in weeks at the University of South Australia, is being torpedoed by feminist ideologues. This involves feminists in academe and in the Australian media who are working in concert to smear the architects of the Male Studies initiative as "woman haters" who have affiliations with "fringe groups."

We have it from reliable sources that the undermining was swift and complete. The University of South Australia folded like a cheap suit and have withdrawn their support of the important initiative.

A historic first, as activists from around North America converged on a park near the Provincial Parliament in Toronto to protest and make the public aware of the growing crisis for boys and men in contemporary society. Multiple speeches were given by multiple parties.

Soon, it will be New Year's Day (even in Canada). We will have 2014 stretched out before us in all its infinite possibilities to enjoy month after month of the ever more nefarious business of treating men and boys like human beings.

It is time for a discussion about what we are sure will be known as the Year of Absolute EVIL.
You are welcome to join the Shit Stirring Superstar of Siamese Slaughter, John Hembling, the Duchess of Doom, Lady of Labia Traitors, Karen Straughan, and the Humongous -- the One and Only Overlord of Awful, Paul Elam, for a special New Year's Day Hangout, where we will undoubtedly be stepping all over each other, perhaps even getting violent, to compete for the position of Highest Evil in our sinister coven.
Either that, or we will have a few laughs and speculate about how far feminists will take stupid in the coming year.

And of course, you are welcome to visit this very page to view it live, tomorrow, January 1, 2014 at 10:00 AM in Vancouver, B.C. , 11:00 AM GWW Time, High Noon in Houston, and Six O'Clock in Hell!

Title: Roundup, Year in Review: MHRM Grows, Feminists Damsel and ABC News Turns Chicken
Date: 2013-12-30

Description: PLEASE LIKE TO HELP SPREAD THE WORD. Thanks!

As we approach the end of 2013 the AVFM Monday Roundup, which usually takes on the news stories of the past week that are of importance to the MRHM, now takes on the task of reviewing the entire year.

And what a year it was for the movement! In fact, 2013 was a banner year for all of sexual politics. It was a time of great expansion for the MRHM. It was a time when feminists perfected the art of damseling for money on the internet. It was a time when media giant ABC News started to attack AVFM, then tucked their tails in and ran away from the story.

We have that and a lot more to discuss in this special edition of Roundup, and of course your comments will be a part of the festivities.

Please join your hosts, Dr. Tara Palmatier, AVFM Managing Editor Dean Esmay and the ever warm and fuzzy founder of AVFM, Paul Elam, tomorrow at 4:00 PM CST, 5 PM EST, 10PM in London and 1:00 AM in Djibouti.

Title: Monday Roundup: Christmas Collegiate Rape Special

Description: The powers that be at Occidental College got their anti-rape panties in a twist, feeling all violated because some 400 internet users decided to flood their anonymous rape reporting mechanism with spam in order to render the useless system even more useless. Poor darlings, it dampened their holiday cheer.

More here: http://www.avoiceformen.com/hangouts/avfm-monday-hangout-christmas-collegiate-rape-special/
So now they are trying to conjure up plans to make another anonymous finger-pointing application that is less vulnerable to interference from outsiders. We guess no one told them that 911 has been in business for a long time.

In the spirit of the holidays, managing editor Dean Esmay of AVFM, Dr. Tara Palmatier of Shrink4Men.com and Evil Overlord Paul Elam will gather on Monday, December 23, 2013 at 4PM CST, 5 Eastern to give Occidental the Christmas gift of every feminist dreams, their top suggestions on how to manufacture as many rape claims as possible in the shortest period of time, with the least amount of effort.

And of course, YOU will be able to offer your ideas in the comments, which we will read aloud during the hangout! So c'mon MHRAs! People are always saying we need to work with feminists. What better way to do it than to help them manufacture damaging lies for the sake of profit and ideology?

Get your warm, holiday, social justice fuzzy on and show up for this important Hangout!

http://www.blogtalkradio.com/avoiceformen/2013/09/13/feminisms-pimp-hand

"Are the Vagina's in the house!" Eve Elsner screams to a cheering audience of feminists.

Yep. All us women? We're just vaginas.

And that's all that we are.

You know who else reduces women down to their genitals?

Pimps.

Specifically pimps reduce women down to what the pimp can extract in terms of benefit from their vaginas.

Sorta like feminists.

Except for feminists it's not the vagina's use that's of interest, but it's abuse. And whatever can be twisted into abuse of vaginas.

Make no mistake, like the pimp, all they care about is your vagina. If you didn't have a vagina, they wouldn't really care what happened to you.

You're a whore in their stable, pimped out for their benefit. And if you refuse to be feminsim's whore, watch out for their pimp hand!

The instant you say no, you'll see just how deep sisterhood goes.

Title: AVFM's Honey Badger Radio: A Witch Hunt in Atheism?
Date: 2013-08-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kI1-TGRO7OU
Description: The people of Salem, Massachusetts in the 1600s lived in a culture that accepted the existence of the devil, assorted demons and other evil spirits, including witches, and which encouraged them to blame all misfortune and conflict in the community on these supernatural causes.

The people of the modern day West live in a culture that largely accepts the existence the Patriarchy, Rape Culture, and Cultural Misogyny, and which encourages them to blame all misfortune and conflict in the community--from rape to domestic violence to the pay gap to male-only conscription--on these ethereal and unfalsifiable "social constructs".

The Salem witch trials began with accusations against an opposing camp--a rival family in the community engaged in a long-standing feud with the family of the accused.

The flurry of recent sexual misconduct accusations in the Atheist/sceptic community essentially began with an invitation to continue a conversation over coffee, proffered by an unnamed man in an elevator. That invitation was ground zero for the splintering of that community into two rival camps--one which embraced scepticism and the rejection of any notion of an invisible, unmeasurable superior power that rules all our lives, and one which embraced dogmatism.

A witch hunt has begun in the sceptic community--one side asking for evidence, and the other demanding blind faith. Who will prevail? God knows...

Title: Honeybadger Radio on AVFM RE: Cathy Young
Date: 2013-08-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=YKwNpeI34fM
Description: "Why can't we all get along?" is the war cry of the immoderate moderate. You know the one, she tries to sell a softened extremism and chastises us for not adopting it.

She's existed throughout the ages. Always trying to keep the peace by selling out someone's civil rights and saying "wow, how ungrateful, how rude, how outrageous" when that they catch on to the immoderate moderate's schtick. "Don't they understand that they have to behave themselves before they get to speak?"

The immoderate moderate loves the idea of "behaving yourself". Who decides what "behaving yourself" entails? They do of course.

What gave them the privileged position of deciding acceptable discourse? Well... the very control the oppressed group is fighting to end.

Which is why the immoderate moderate isn't a moderate at all. They're extremists with an agenda to silence.

Join Karen Straughan(Girl Writes What), Alison Tieman(Typhonblue) and Della Burton(Oneiorosgrip) 7 pm Central Standard time on August 15th 2013 for the inaugural episode of AVfM's honey badger radio. We'll be discussing the immoderate moderate and her latest incarnation, Cathy Young.

Title: On the Death of Sung Jae-gi
Date: 2013-08-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=jXpo6XT-bu8
Description: On July 25th, 2013, Activist Sung Jae-gi, head of men's rights advocacy group, Man of Korea, jumped from the Mapo Bridge which crosses the Han River in South Korea. It was intended to be a simple publicity stunt that would bring attention to the group and raise money for its activities. Tragically, Mr. Sung did not survive the jump from which he intended to walk away.

During the following three weeks AVFM has reached out to Man of Korea and we have received many emails from members and interested parties. However, it was only yesterday that we were able to interview someone who spoke English fluently.

The young man, who wishes to be known only as Wayne, is not a member of Man of Korea and does not speak for them per se. But he did give us vital information on the group as well as the state of men in Korea and the influence of feminism in that country.

Our deeply felt condolences go out to Mr. Sung's family and friends and we look forward to developing a relationship with Man of Korea as soon as they recover from this terrible loss.

Description: Shortly after the news broke that Julia Gillard was fired, AVFM's Dean Esmay contacted Barry Williams, Australia's only registered Federal lobbyist for men's and family issues and founder of the Lone Fathers Association for his reaction to the news. As usual, Barry had a lot to say; The news has him optimistic about the future, and about efforts he's spearheading with the Australian Parliament as wellas the Australian courts. Barry's a true Australian hero, and we hope this helps him kick some ass there in the Australian Capitol Territory.

Date: 2013-05-28

Description: This is an interview I just had for the student newspaper of Amherst College. I challenged several of his contentions, e.g. rape culture (1 in 4 rape claim), wage gap, domestic violence statistics.

Here is the data that debunks

1. The feminist domestic violence paradigm that only recognizes male perpetrators and female victims.

Title: Toronto Star Interview with Paul
Date: 2013-04-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=wcEEHLvw9Kw
Description: The video here does not need any real explanation. It is business as usual with the mainstream media. This time the Toronto Star sent a young reporter, Carys Mills, to speak with me.

During the discussion, she indicated that the University of Toronto had elected to employ special measures to protect students, perhaps in response to their vandals and thugs being profiled on this site. As promised, she did provide me a link to that information.

http://www.provost.utoronto.ca/office/Provostial_Statements/Provost_s_Statement_on_Recent_Controversial_Events_on_Campus__December_2012_.htm

Here is my response to her via email:

Thank you for sending this. It is unfortunately hard to respond in a comprehensive way. There is no direct mention from U of T admin about the abuse of students trying to enter the Farrell lecture. Nor is there any proof provided of the threats they mentioned, which they seem to indirectly attribute to AVFM. I suppose if you think that video evidence and public confession online of the acts that we addressed do not constitute sufficient proof, then perhaps you may also have questions for U of T admin regarding proof that any threats were made.

Personally, I am not buying it. I am 100% certain that no individual associated with AVFM would condone or tolerate any type of threat made against anyone. If I found out that anyone was, their connection with AVFM would be quickly severed. I am also 100% certain that the individuals who orchestrated the harassment, bullying, door blockading and vandalism that happened on November 16, have already spread a great deal of disinformation about AVFM, CAFE, Warren Farrell, Janice Fiamengo and others.

I can sympathize that in the face of complaints that students are being harassed, real, imagined or concocted, U of T admin would likely feel obligated to issue a statement condemning such actions. I condemn them too, but I am not convinced they ever happened.

Description: http://www.blogtalkradio.com/avoiceformen/2012/11/09/hypergamy

Did you ever notice the tendency in most women to constantly crave something a little, uh, better when it comes to the men in their lives?

Do women stand on the lookout for men with more money, power, prestige, social standing or sex appeal than the men they already have?

Yes, as a matter of fact most of them do.

Tonight,, Join Girl Writes What, TyphonBlue and Robert O'hara, who is standing in for regular host John the Other for all the hype on hypergamy, that dirty little secret that seems to catch most men blindside because they don't know what they are looking for or why they should.

The show starts tonight, November 8, 2012 at 9 PM Eastern Time, 8 Central, which is 2:00 AM Nov 9 in London and 11 AM Nov. 9 in Brisbane.

The call in number for the show is 310-388-9709.

Title: AVfM Radio: The Toxic Victim
Date: 2012-09-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=jOMiJEDnljs
Description: The power of victimhood is something which victims, particularly self selecting victims, understand. However, this is becoming increasingly easy for everyone else to understand because self selecting victims are a growing demographic with increasing dominance of the social landscape, and their power is to control everybody else through the most ancient and noblest of human instincts, our compassion.

Without directly passing through the pain and damage normally associated with victimhood, the predatory victim is emerging as a new class of tyrant, trashing the human rights of others and masterfully manipulating the use of proxy violence against their victims.

Tonight on AVfM Radio, John the Other, Typhon Blue and Girl Writes What examine the most toxic elements of the current social landscape, and The Predatory Victim.

6 PM Pacific time, 8 PM Mountain time

Title: Those Who Oppose Us
Date: 2012-05-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=qG_Jxt6N-Ek
Description: Those Who Oppose Us

The rift between men and women has widened throughout recorded history
In today's free world there are those that seek to widen that rift even further
Some widen it with claims of men's oppression of women
They widen it with claims that masculinity is evil
That men are born oppressors that need to be fixed
Others widen it with dehumanizing standards of chivalry and self sacrifice
They call themselves feminists and traditionalists
Democrats and republicans
Feminists trivialize the discrimination men face
To them, men have no issues, men can't face discrimination
Because men are privileged
Men's problems are insignificant
Underserving of attention until all of their demands for women are satisfied

In the face of this hatred, there's only one logical response

FUCK EM
Fuck feminists
Fuck the left
Fuck the right
Fuck anyone in between who feels men don't deserve rights
Fuck everyone who claims men need to be fixed
Fuck everyone who ignores that men suffer right along side women
Fuck anyone who thinks they can define men or masculinity

I'm the only one that can define me you fucking bigots
My status as human doesn't depend on what I can do for women or society
The time for silence is fucking over
It's time to raise your voice
Because the truth is out
And Those who oppose us can't stop it now
The truth is set free and hatemongers don't wanna listen
But the jig is up bigots, so fuckin' pay attention

There's a message been growin' for years and now it's seen the light
In defense of masculinity
Men's rights
Those who oppose us with your hateful ideology
It's time for men to get their fair share of the equality

Equal rights for men
Those who oppose us want none of it
Men oppressed women for years
At least that's how they spun it
Men are privileged
The rulers of the world
Why care about them when you can care about girls?
Well Take a look around as you walkin' through the streets
At the men scrapin' for the change shinin' at your feet
A second thought about em' never crossed your mind
Because a man needin' help doesn't fall in line
With the free world's view of the issues that need action

When it's men on the bottom the issue looses traction
The majority of the homeless got a dick
But you wouldn't know
According to the media men just run the show
And the family courts?
Don't even them started
When the process is over men are nothin' but a wallet
When his pockets are empty they stack him on a prison shelf
Only option left in his mind?
Fuckin' kill himself

Suicide rates overflow among men
But they ain't the right gender so they garner no attention
Only thing you'll hear is bout some deadbeat dad
Vanished from the world money left on his tab

And you bigots wonder why men are angry?
Want the message toned down?
Quiter?
More friendly?

I'm not standin' at the back of your line or your bus
Nah
I'm here to fuck your shit up

It's time to raise your voice
Because the truth is out
And
Those who oppose us can't stop it now

The truth is set free and hatemongers don't wanna listen
But the jig is up bigots, so fuckin' pay attention
There's a message been growin' for years and now it's seen the light
In defense of masculinity
Men's rights
Those who oppose us with your hateful ideology
It's time for men to get their fair share of the equality

I'm just gettin started and your time is coming to an end
Like I said in the hook fuckin' pay attention

Discrimination holds no bars against a young man
Even when its got its claws wrapped around a boy's hand
Put a man with a girl
They call it statuatory rape
But when a woman's with a boy?
They call that shit a date

Lock the evil dick up and throw away the key
But give that poor oppressed woman all the fuckin' sympathy
And don't forget that little boy has got responsbilities

This the part about it all that really fuckin kills me
When a woman gets pregnant and her victim can't escape it
Now a boy has to pay his strong independent rapist
Those who oppose us don't want you to know
About the pain men endure all around the globe
When we show them facts
They just scream in indignation
Women are the only ones who face discrimination

Fuck that bullshit your reign is over
Men are done just lyin' down and rollin' over
For every lie that you told we got the media's attention
And we ringing in the truth twice as hard as your ommitions

Our voices are finally being heard
No longer silenced by some muthafuckin 'empty words
And if you bigots got a problem here's a tip
Cry me a river
Build a bridge
And get the fuck over it

It's time to raise your voice
Because the truth is out
And
Those who oppose us can't stop it now

The truth is set free and hatemongers don't wanna listen
But the jig is up bigots, so fuckin' pay attention
There's a message been growin' for years and now it's seen the light
In defense of masculinity
Men's rights
Those who oppose us with your hateful ideology
It's time for men to get their fair share of the equality

Description: Jade Michael and the FTSU Crew

Lyrics

Go my Own Way
Words and Music by Jade Michael

VERSE 1:
We're through with being bred on blame
Used to wipe out all your pain
And we're through with holding doors
Entitlements abound
You say that we still hold you down
And you cop that attitude
No remorse or gratitude

PreChorus:
Cos' the time has come to fuck your shit up
The time has come to fuck your shit up
The time has come to fuck your shit up
Brother don't you ever give up

CHORUS :
Go My Own Way! (Repeat)

Verse 2:
You're obsessed with my ability
I won't be your utility
I'll never carry you
And I sure won't marry you
You allege that you're abused
Stories told when you know you'll lose
But the truth is calling me
And it's all I need...

Pre Chorus:
Cos the time has come to fuck your shit up
Yeah the time has come to fuck your shit up
Well the time has come to fuck your shit up
Giving rise to all that's right, now

Solo & Bass Break

Newscast Sample:

Yeah, the time has come to fuck your shit up
The time has come to fuck your shit up
The time has come to fuck your shit up
Brother don't you ever give up
