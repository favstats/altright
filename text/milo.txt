Title: A message to UC Berkeley from MILO and the Berkeley Patriots
Date: 2017-09-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=rn5Xgak1zzA
Description: Berkeley “Free Speech Week,” an event organized by student group the Berkeley Patriot and underwritten by MILO Inc., will occur as scheduled, running from September 24 to September 27 on the campus of UC Berkeley, despite attempts by the university to use bureaucratic maneuvers and strategic media leaks to disrupt the event and dissuade headline speakers from attending.

The paperwork was filed on deadline, and MILO, Inc. transferred the required $65,758.76 to UC Berkeley to arrive at 8 AM ET Monday. Nevertheless, the University has not yet indicated it will grant access to Wheeler and Zellerbach. This move represents the latest in a stream of administrative efforts by UC Berkeley officials to shut down or damage Free Speech Week. 

A paper trail of dozens of emails (available to journalists upon request) shows that questions about security, refunds, and insurance policies from the student group were ignored by the administration of UC Berkeley for more than three weeks.

“On the advice of our attorney, we had asked the University to amend the contracts for Wheeler and Zellerbach to provide for a partial refund if the University cancelled the event,” said a member of the Berkeley Patriot familiar with the situation. “Given the University’s history of cancelling conservative events, this was an entirely reasonable request, but they evaded our question for weeks. 

“When the University’s Interim Vice Chancellor finally did email us a contract at 3:30PM ET last Friday, the contract lacked the refund provision entirely. Instead it came with a 90-minute deadline that we had to sign and pay $65,000 that day. We signed and returned it immediately, but the Interim Vice Chancellor refused to accept it anyway.”

“It’s quite simple: The University didn’t want the event to happen, but they couldn’t cancel outright, so they needed to make it look like it was our own fault,” said Pranav Jandhyala, News Editor for the Berkeley Patriot. “What we’ve experienced throughout this entire four months has been bureaucratic stonewalling. 

While the administrators were ignoring over 20 calls and emails from the student group between Wednesday and Friday of last week, they were making calls to journalists, attempting to sow fear, uncertainty and doubt about whether Free Speech Week would proceed. UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof told the Los Angeles Times that the Berkeley Patriots had not filed the appropriate paperwork and maliciously hinted that the entire event might be cancelled, in a story published hours before the university’s abrupt and arbitrary deadline. 

The University’s attempt to deny the Berkeley Patriot access to Wheeler and Zellerbach is not the only bureaucratic obstacle the University has thrown in front of the event. Earlier this month, UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof leaked a preliminary speaker list, which included author Ann Coulter and former chief strategist to the President Stephen K Bannon, to the Chronicle of Higher Education. 

“The most charitable explanation is that UC Berkeley was trying to drum up opposition to the event. Actually, the university deliberately gave a heads-up to domestic terrorist organizations like Antifa, which got a month-long head start on Berkeley police,” said MILO. 

According to students, the Interim Vice Chancellor earlier rescinded at the last minute an agreement with the Berkeley Patriot regarding the number of security applications required for the event. When it first booked Free Speech Week, the Berkeley Patriot had been told that only one security application was required, but Sutton altered the deal, informing the students they needed to file 12 separate security applications and criticizing them for not having done so already.

The University also waited until the last possible moment before informing the Berkeley Patriot that its insurance would not cover the event, forcing the student group to get a certificate of insurance from the event’s underwriter on short notice.

“Since it got sued last year for restricting its students’ free speech rights, Berkeley has been trying to virtue signal its support for free speech by hosting establishment-friendly conservatives like Ben Shapiro, even giving them massive discounts on fees,” said Milo Yiannopoulos, founder and Chief Creative Officer of MILO Inc. “But we represent the true frontier of free speech, and when it comes to genuine free expression UC Berkeley is terrified of leftist violence that the university has either quietly ignored or actively cultivated for years. Antifa thugs cannot be allowed to censor free expression, so we are going to Berkeley, and Free Speech Week is happening, whether they like it or not.”

Title: ANGEL MOM (2016)
Date: 2016-10-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Xp0DaFEioBo
Description: ANGEL MOM??r>MILO, 2016 
Ceramic bathtub and pig's blood 

In this installation, MILO pays tribute to the suffering of those who have lost loved ones at the hands of illegal aliens and Islamic terrorists. Many violent criminals have been deported multiple times only to return to the United States to commit more crime. 

Drenched in the blood of innocents, MILO urges the viewer to consider the suffering wrought by globalist, Left-wing immigration policies, lax policing and the obsessive pandering and mollycoddling of Islam by progressive social justice warriors. 

MILO is a warning from Europe. He urges the viewer to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN in November.

Description: I was asked for a better path forward in race relations and I gave a really good answer. I mean I always do, but this one was particularly good. Black Lives Matter is not the answer, it's attacking a problem with a new, different problem. It's foolish to make a point by ruining your own things.

Title: The Shaun King Stream with Milo Yiannopoulos
Date: 2015-12-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=V-PQDJj0LuU
Description: This Tuesday at 2pm ET, join Breitbart editors Alex Marlow, Milo Yiannopoulos and Lee Stranahan, Breitbart writer Allum Bokhari and guests from other media organisations to discuss the unfolding Shaun King controversy.

We’ll discuss the race scandal that engulfed Black Lives Matter activist and New York Daily News senior justice writer King in August this year, when Breitbart published explosive allegations from investigative blogger Vicki Pate that King might have been fudging essential biographical information in order to ingratiate himself with the Black Lives Matter movement. The story was an international sensation.

From there, journalists and bloggers unearthed more disturbing allegations from King’s own supporters: accusations that King had mismanaged his charity, Justice Together, and questions black activists still have about how King handled donations from his supporters.

We’ll cover King’s bizarre public meltdown after he was publicly booted from the Black Lives Matter movement by other activists, including his Twitter deletion spree, peculiar emails to multiple media outlets and his refusal to answer questions even now about Justice Together’s finances.

Finally, we’ll discuss where the Black Lives Matter movement goes next, and what’s in store for King himself.

HOUR 1: RACE

1400 START
1410 VICKI PATE – RE-NEWSIT!
1420 LEE STRANAHAN – BREITBART
1440 SONNIE JOHNSON – BREITBART

HOUR 2: FINANCES, EMAILS, TWITTER

Title: #FreedomofTweets with Lauren Southern and Guests: The Gregory Allen Elliot Stream
Date: 2015-11-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ViiAiHW0OiQ
Description: His name is Gregory Alan Elliott. He has been on trial for three years, in a costly Canadian court battle with drastic implications for free speech. For two years, he was banned from the internet, where he previously earned much of his income. His artwork, hanging in a local coffee shop in Toronto, was recently defaced by a mob of enraged activists.

Crippled by loss of work and the ongoing court case, Elliott and his family have been forced to turn to an online crowdfunding campaign to cover their legal costs. What did he do to bring about such persecution? Did he kill someone? IS he a virulent white supremacist? A campaigner for pedophile rights? No. Elliott criticised feminists on the internet.
