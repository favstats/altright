Title: The Black Pill (Kingmaker Podcast)
Date: 2017-11-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ebJ1nXu1LV4
Description: In this podcast, I examine the "black pill," a frame of thinking that focuses on inaction and acceptance. After examining its core tenets, I describe the most common signs you are getting black pilled and why it's inevitable if you happen to live in a declining society. I address the important connection between our internal emotional states and the external environment and also tackle the argument that inaction is a sign of weakness or cowardice. Lastly, I talk about where to draw the line in the sand when it comes to fighting back against wrongs that you encounter.

Title: The Girls Of Brazil (Kingmaker Podcast)
Date: 2017-04-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=RVmW5D78NNY
Description: Quintus Curtius joins me to discuss Brazilian girls and what they can offer men. We describe their general appearance, their demeanor, and what type of game will lead to successful intimacy with them. We share what you can reasonably expect from a 1-2 week trip there, including how much you will spend per day and how to stay safe in a country that has become more dangerous over the past decade. We also discuss if Brazilian girls are worthy for long-term relationships and marriage. Lastly, we analyze the direction Brazilian culture is headed, and if we expect a future decline in the women that puts them on par with American girls.

Title: Warning Signs A Girl Isn't Worth Your Time (Kingmaker Podcast)
Date: 2017-04-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=RwVF_T_E1rk
Description: This podcast contains more than a dozen warning signs when a girl is damaged goods or is not worth pursuing. The warning signs are categorized according to appearance, day game approaches, night game approaches, setting dates, going on dates, and relationships. They have held true for me across multiple continents to help save both time and energy while focusing on girls who are more likely to please me in short-term and long-term relationships.

Title: The Death Of Western Culture (Kingmaker Podcast)
Date: 2017-03-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=uebI8N7CoSU
Description: A healthy culture allows people to create families, pursue prosperity, and experience fulfillment. A culture that is in the process of collapsing promotes sterility, hedonism, materialism, degeneracy, and mental insanity. In this podcast, I trace the seven steps of how a culture can decline, applying each step to what we see in the Western world. Because it's so difficult to reverse a culture's descent into sterility, our best option is to identity seeds of resistance and allow them to grow into a new healthy culture that brushes the broken culture aside.

We focus on sharing the ideal type of game that is necessary to succeed for both casual encounters and long-term relationships that could lead to marriage and family creation.

Title: The Danger Of Hedonic Adaptation (Kingmaker Podcast)
Date: 2017-02-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=yDrt0Pba5n8
Description: This podcast explores the hedonic treadmill, which states that people will adapt to pleasure over time, making its pursuit a marginal endeavor. Through four life examples, I show how this adaptation affects your perceptions of both pleasure and pain, before discussing the implication that we will eventually adapt to anything encountered in the material world. I share my thoughts on how to deal with this awareness and how I used it to make a recent decision that came after a negative event in my life.

Title: How The Manosphere Crushed Feminism (Kingmaker Podcast)
Date: 2017-01-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-WgAn6GFU0E
Description: Donald Trump's ascendance, aided by masculine men who vehemently deny political correctness, is evidence that the manosphere has had a monumental effect on Western culture. I trace the history of the manosphere from 1999 onward with special guest Samseau, a long-time Return Of Kings contributor, to lay out exactly how the manosphere came to impact the world of men through game, feminist critiques, and political activism, all while affecting other movements like men's rights and the alt right. We discuss how manosphere teachings have become normalized in the minds of those who don't even know what the manosphere is, and also how its power will continue to grow.

Title: The Death Of Night Game (Kingmaker Podcast)
Date: 2017-01-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=nEzD98VA8q0
Description: This podcast explores the decline of nightlife (bars and clubs) from 2001 to 2017. I first establish a baseline of the absurdly low level of game you needed in the past to succeed compared to what you need now, followed by an analysis of 15 observations that show how we have objectively suffered a decline. I close out the podcast by discussing how to solve the problems posed by a declining nightlife to still maintain a healthy sex life, which include being industrious and open-minded to alternate forms of game.

Title: 8 Productivity Tips I Use Daily (Kingmaker Podcast)
Date: 2017-01-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ODuTJdrRfqI
Description: In this podcast, I explain eight productivity tips that I use every day to create the work that you enjoy from me. They include how to prepare for a day's work the night before, how to approach a work session, how to minimize distractions, and how to handle excessive noise in your environment. These tips all seem like common sense to me now, but there was a time that I didn't use any of them and experienced less concentration and efficiency as a result.

Title: The Political Nature Of Man (Kingmaker Podcast)
Date: 2016-12-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=hasnLvveWAg
Description: How involved should a man get with politics? Should he become an activist who is eternally politically aware or should he forget about politics entirely? In this podcast, I explain both the benefits and costs of getting involved with politics and how my inclusion on a "hate list" in 2012 caused me to dedicate much of my life to the political, with little to show for it in the end. I describe the threat of social justice to a heterosexual man's existence and what I believe is the ideal strategy for balancing a well-lived life with avoiding oppression. I also share my rules of engagement for when there is no other option but to fight back.

Title: The Serenity Of Stoicism (Kingmaker Podcast)
Date: 2016-11-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Do-H1ipgoyQ
Description: Stoicism is a philosophy for your mind that helps you deal with suffering and misfortune. In this podcast, I review stoicism's strongest points as presented by three powerful thinkers (Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius) by using direct quotes from their most important works. I also share how I've used stoicism to reduce pain in my own life and how you can do the same through an effectively four-point strategy.

Title: What Travel Can Do For A Man (Kingmaker Podcast)
Date: 2016-10-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=suofKwkjLWg
Description: This podcast discusses the role of modern travel on the development of men. After reviewing how travel is most commonly used, I share the specific benefits travel can offer along with the mistaken ideas of what naive people think travel can accomplish. I discuss seven of my favorite travel rules for men and also take an aside to discuss the growing phenomenon of finding a foreign wife, which is harder than many men think. I close out the podcast by prescribing a strategy of using travel to maximum your strength and potential.

Title: The Making Of A Modern Man (Kingmaker Podcast)
Date: 2016-09-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=f_pxyYhzN70
Description: In this debut podcast, I discuss the importance of a man's environment on shaping him because of how it acts as a mirror to his existence. I propose that modern Western civilization, with its ideas of individualism, materialism, and hedonism, have created a toxic environment that is hurting its inhabitants more severely than had they been raised in a traditional society, using my own life path as a case study. I also discuss what we have gained and lost by moving from a traditional society to a modern one.

Title: Roosh Q&A: American Politics
Date: 2016-07-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=uv0nCsZJguI
Description: QUESTION INDEX:

0:13
If you were a president or a influential congressional member, how would you encourage nationalism without neglecting minority groups such as blacks, latinos, asians, etc? Since those groups do have political and financial power. Also how would you keep nationalism in check to prevent another world war since keep in mind that nationalism and militarism were the primary causes of WWI and a factor (not the primary cause) of WWII. (JANE PETERSON)

6:52
If Trump fails to deliver on what you expect and/or is a disappointment, what do you recommend we do? (MERCENARY)

10:21
If you became president, what executive orders would you make the first day in office? (SAGETTAURUS)

15:17
What is the actual end goal of causing division and chaos with BLM/Islamic "refugees" etc? Cause enough fear that they can implement martial law? What is the point? I see that the point of global trading, immigration, and feminism is economic due to cheap labor and increased tax revenue, but what is the point of causing racial division in the US? What is the end game of having sharia in Europe? Or are the powers-that-be just naive? (SLIM SHADY)

20:26
Cops quite readily violate probable cause and other such statutes, and lie to get their way - often supported by other cops and courts to charge especially young people with frivolous yet serious crimes. Yet, after the BLM bullshit we have forgotten about these violations and become "pro-cop". How do you reconcile the real infringements on freedom by officers while not giving ground to race-baiting terrorists? (SLIM SHADY)

24:44
While organizations such as Black Lives Matter are dangerous and need to be stopped, it has become obvious in their inaction that the police are handcuffed by bureaucrats, while average citizens are being jailed for ludicrous offenses on a daily basis. What are your feelings on holding police accountable for 1) Their inaction when groups like BLM disrupt peaceful meetings (like the Young Republicans gathering at Depaul) and 2) Continuing to enforce immoral and unconstitutional laws that enable gun confiscation, seizure of assets, false rape accusations, and unfairly targeting and arresting men during domestic violence encounters? (DJDJDJ)

28:23
Do you think that any American leader (Trump or anybody else) can reverse this third-wave, toxic feminism or is America simply too far gone? Another way of asking this is: after the meetup outrage in Feb, have you given up on America? (JOHN QUINCY)

33:30
I have alleged that bringing men into the RoK-sphere is a step-by-step process. First we convince mainstream Republicans to the anti-feminist side, then expose them more and more to the RoK. I seriously doubt mainstream America will go from embracing the gender equality message to Roosh V overnight. And we need mainstream America to convert. Why do you antagonize female anti-feminists? (JOHN QUINCY)

36:20
What should be the #1 medium-term strategic goal of the nationalist/patriot wave? In my mind, it's destroying the media. Do you have a different assessment? (LIBERTAS)

39:11
As a man on a college campus, how can I fight against feminism? (JUSTIN)

READER REVIEW:

Free Speech isn’t Free is a watershed work detailing the (mis)adventures of Roosh and his followers during his book tour of 2015 and the February 2016 RoK meet ups. Being a part of the forum during both of these events only revealed a quarter of what was going on to the man himself. Getting a glimpse of Roosh’s inner world during these harrowing events showed us that even under great stress and pressure, a strategic win is never impossible.

Unlike Roosh’s previous works that i’ve read (Bang & Day Bang), Free Speech isn’t Free departs from the older scientifically detached writing that we’re used to and changes into something that spoke from a more emotional place.

Being so close to these events made this a nail biter. Much to my shame I wasn’t able to attend, but now knowing what was going on in the background made me disappointed with myself for not being more focused during the war time measures. How can Roosh fight effectively if we’re all just being misfocused kittens over here?

The beginning took a bit of time to get into. It almost felt like the beginning of Bang with that familiar analytic approach. Once Reggie hit the scene, things started to get real. Roosh was no longer an internet blogger but a full on media sensation.

This fails to mention the spiritual journey we also find Roosh embarking on as he attempts to hold a private discussion with a few of his followers. I’m a casual reader of Roosh’s blog, but some of the things revealed in the book show a deeply spiritual man who has worked hard to learn about himself and seek the truth. In that quest, he found meaning in the strangest of places.

This story has the potential to be one of those books for a generation like The Diary of Anne Frank and The Catcher and the Rye that others in the future can read to get a cultural cross section of what life was like for men in the early part of the 21st century.

By far the strongest book Roosh has written to date. Highly recommended.

I shot this during a night walk through the center of Odessa in September 2014, mostly to test the low light video capability of the Nikon D5200. Camera settings: 1/50 shutter, 24 fps, 6400 ISO, maximum aperture on 18-55mm kit lens. The camera has higher ISO settings in Hi1 (12800 ISO) and Hi2 (25600 ISO) but they introduce too much noise.
