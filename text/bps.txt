Lyrics to the song


I don't think I'll read the paper today
All of these bombings and killings fill me with a bitter taste
In my mouth..

Something feels wrong on the streets of Manchester
The drawn sullen faces of passersby tell me this isn't the end
It will happen again..

And a new day has broke over Buckingham palace
A unit of Royal Guards solemnly lower their Union Jack
To fly at half mast..

And on London bridge they're falling down
Let the bodies hit the ground
London bridge they're falling down
My dear lady..

Father please tell me of when you were little?
How you could walk on the street where you live
Without having to fear
dark men with dark beards..

What the f*** happened to Britain my country?
Why are there women in veils on the streets speaking foreign tongues?
Where once there were none?

On London bridge they're falling down
Let the bodies hit the ground
London bridge they were cut down
My dear lady..

Something is coming just stop and you'll hear it
A strong cup of tea and a stiff upper lip is no match for a fist
And so I enlist..

So to all of you traitors and all of you cuckolds
A ballot or bullet we'll retake our homes bit by bit till we've won
And all the ballots are gone..

Cause on London bridge they were cut down
See the bodies on the ground
London bridge they were cut down
My dear lady..

I don't think I'll read the paper today
All of these bombings and killings fill me a white hot hatred
In my heart..

On London bridge they were cut down
See the bodies on the ground
London bridge they were cut down
My dear lady..

Title: PewDiePie's Media Contrived Anti-Semitism
Date: 2017-02-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kwPRH_u2rl8
Description: I'm not adopting a personal opinion about the matter of the holocaust death toll, I'm talking about how the Jewish Telegraph Agency and multiple press outlets with an audience of predominantly jewish people came out with the story that Simon Wiesenthal admitted to making up the 5 million gentile holocaust victims out of nowhere.

The point of the video was to show the phenomenon of fake news in action whereby the entire mainstream media completely ignored a radical change in the scope of the holocaust while also acting in unison to make a mountain out of a molehill over some youtube vlogger's inconsequential jokes.

That is why the thumbnail has the title: FAKE NEWS

Title: Black Lives Matter: The Rise of the "DINDU"
Date: 2016-03-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=dm_Vv3Q24uQ
Description: Michael Brown was a man, who robbed a liquor store and at the same time assaulted its clerk. He then went on to attack a police officer and attempted to hijack his weapon and was shot in the ensuing scuffle. 
And to top it all off, Black Lives Matter (BLM) got its start and first martyr. Also many in his community and then nationwide tried to claim him to be an innocent "gentle giant." 

The term "dindu," became popular in the aftermath of Michael Brown's death and the Ferguson, Missouri riots to describe a certain class of criminal. The term is a pejorative for criminals and gang members (and their families) who feign innocence and never take responsibility for their actions (when caught in the commission of a crime by the police). It is used, in the title to explain the rise of criminals and their supporters who believe they are not required to be responsible for their actions and now have movements like BLM who will support them against "the system" no matter what they do. 

The media / government and those that fund them: The corporations. The well funded (George Soros) along with academia is pushing to divide peoples everywhere. They use events like this to enrage people. Resist with knowledge. 

This whole video was inspired by someone who sent me the article on the former Marine being assaulted by BLM supporters.

Title: How Face Shape EXPOSES — White RACISM (fWHR)
Date: 2016-01-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-Kv_VmSizrA
Description: Recent research by Social Scientists indicates that men with high levels of testosterone have certain facial characteristics that set them apart from men with less testosterone. 

In particular, they have what researchers call a higher facial Width-to-Height Ratio (fWHR) which compares the distance between cheekbones to the distance between the upper lip and mid brow. Men with a higher ratio have faces that appear a bit wider horizontally and bit compressed vertically.


Men with greater width-to-height ratios, the study found, had a greater urge to be socially dominant and cared less what others thought of them. They are also supposedly more prone to share their racist thoughts in public as well.

Description: In this video we will not be focusing on the migrant crime and rape waves currently engulfing Europe but on what the next few years will entail should the current political and de-facto plans being carried out go unchanged. 

We will trying and explain why, in our view, this seemingly mad undertaking is being carried out and also why the populations of the West are for the most part, are currently accepting *whether grudgingly or not -this massive and unalterable change to their countries.

Title: Mass RAPE in Cologne Germany : Refugees STILL Welcome!
Date: 2016-01-07

Description: New Year's Eve 2016. 
The Mass Rape of German women by the Muslim invaders has begun. It is only going to get worse. 

Europe is now a dusty collection of dead empires. These new arrivals are the maggots in the corpses.

Soon, only bones shall remain. Rusted and gnarled fingers of twisted steel glittering with broken glass reaching skyward to an absentee God.

Title: MIGRANT EUROPE: Suicide Via Self-Congratulatory ALTRUISM.
Date: 2015-12-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=bDFARl2b_4Y
Description: Germany is going about trying to destroy Europe for the third time in a hundred years. 

So part of the rational behind opening Germany’s borders is that their economy needs new workers. They have been whining about the lack of skilled people for years, it started before the ongoing invasion. But it’s obvious that people arriving there won’t be able to fill the positions a modern, high tech economy offers, these require skills (I guess mostly STEM). What the migrants are going to fill though is available housing. They won’t leave any room for skilled, educated people – whom the Germans actually want to move there. These (middle class) people won’t be willing to live in ghettos even if there’s enough room for them. Only the desperate will move there from now on, and the Germans can kiss good bye to any economic growth. 

When you see every argument that is postulated shot to peices, you begin to realize that this entire crisis is a Western mental illness, born out of shame and of the racism of lower expectations plus a feminized state.
