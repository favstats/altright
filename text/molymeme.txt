Title: Will President Donald Trump Grant DACA Amnesty?

Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3958-will-president-donald-trump-grant-daca-amnesty

On June 15, 2012, President Barack Obama announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals [DACA] - an executive order which bypassed lawmakers and offered similar legal status to an estimated 1.7 million illegal immigrants. 

In June 2017, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and others announced plans to challenge DACA in court if the Trump administration has not agreed to phase out the program by September 5th, 2017. 

On September 5, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA was being repealed – and that implementation will be suspended for six months.

With President Donald Trump’s seeming willingness to betray a central campaign promise and give amnesty to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals [DACA] applicants, many within his base feel betrayed and angry. Stefan Molyneux looks at the consequences of a potential DACA amnesty and how President Trump’s decision will impact the future of the United States of America.

On June 15, 2012, President Barack Obama announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals [DACA] - an executive order which bypassed lawmakers and offered similar legal status to an estimated 1.7 million illegal immigrants. 

In June 2017, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and others announced plans to challenge DACA in court if the Trump administration has not agreed to phase out the program by September 5th, 2017. 

On September 5, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA was being repealed – and that implementation will be suspended for six months. 

What will happen next?

Question: “I'm a 26-year-old man who has been working in the video game industry for the past three years. In this time, I have seen the lengths that most mobile developers go to in order to re-wire the neurological reward systems of their player's brains. By carefully gauging and systemizing the level of achievement needed for dopamine release, most mobile developers profit off of this carefully constructed addiction. Is engineering a voluntary experience (playing video games) to be addictive, moral?”

Question: “I've been living a false life as a woman in an online game and I'm ready come clean, but I fear I will lose a dear friend if I do so, thereby terminating the positive influences he and I have in each other's lives. Can truly moral relationships ever be built on a base of dishonesty? Can lies grow to a point where the revelation of the truth would be so damaging that we're better off living the lie? If my online masquerade has changed me from a lying scoundrel to an honest man in every other aspect of my life, might the lie not be a moral good for the world in general, at the expense of my friend's awareness of the truth?”

Question: “Since heroism is not inherently bad - hero simply means "defender" or "protector", but can be distorted by abuse or manipulated by other's personal motives, what thoughts do you have on how to balance confronting real issues in the world that may require our heroism vs. adopting heroism as a mask, or coping mechanism, for previous trauma or abuse? Conversely, how does one balance withdrawing sanction of an abusive society without "shrugging" out of sheer despair?”

Question: “The Mainstream Media's audiences are dwindling nowadays. However, there has been an uptick in comedians pushing propaganda. I call this ‘comeganda’. In the category of ‘comegandists’ I include Jon Stewart and his pupils like John Oliver as well as others like Bill Maher and Jimmy Kimmel. These people have become the brain of the liberal millennial. Countering these comegandists has been tricky. Whenever questioned the ‘comegandists’ play the ‘I'm just a comedian card. Also their watchers are often stubborn, snarky, and unable to engage in debate. In addition, comeganda is short and uses comedy so it lures in low attention span millennials like a creepy old man offering kids candy. How can we counter this? Should we debunk their arguments? Should we ridicule them? Or should we make ‘comeganda’ of our own by blending humor and politics?”

Question: "My younger sister is 21, identifies as a feminist, enjoys partying, has casual sex, and has a group of friends who I think are bad influences. She's been struggling with depression on and off for the past five or so years. I worry that she is becoming dependent on therapy. There was a time when I reprimanded her and she kept her distance from me for a good six to twelve months. I am afraid of rejection from her. I want to be able to get through to her without her cutting me off. While trying to help her, I asked her to make a five-year plan. She said she'd like to be moved out of our parents home and in a long-term relationship. I worry that as a feminist and as someone who constantly needs to have her feelings affirmed, she is not going to be able to find a high-quality partner. How can I be a good influence on my younger sister?”

On December 12th, 2017, The Department of Justice turned over about 375 text messages to Congress ahead of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s committee appearance the following day. These text messages were uncovered during a Justice Department inspector general investigation into whether political influence affected DOJ decisions during the campaign.

The texts detailed alarming bias and involved FBI Agent Lisa Page and Peter Strzok – who led the Hillary Clinton email investigation including interviewed Clinton aides Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills and Hillary Clinton. Strzok was responsible for changing James Comey’s statement verbiage from “grossly negligent” to extremely careless” – federal law carries penalties for gross negligence in the handling of classified material. Strzok also helped launch the Trump/Russia collusion investigation and interviewed former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn leading to his eventual guilty plea for lying to the FBI under dubious circumstances.

As the future of the United States of America hangs in the balance, the Republicans predictably cowered to the latest Democrat smear attempts in the Alabama Senate election. After being politically abandoned by the Republican party and many mainstream pundits, Judge Roy Moore lost the Alabama Senate election in an upset to Democrat Doug Jones.

She is Mexican American with some of her family being here illegally. I am a Trump supporting ancap born to MAGA, while she is an open border hard ancap Trump skeptic. Should I follow through with my threat to call ICE on her step father who is here illegally and who sexually abused her as a child giving her major depression?”

Question: “I'm trying to create awareness about something I've been witnessing take place lately and I was hoping I could perhaps speak to you about these issues concerning my university, my community and the perception of Cuban Americans, such as my family. Essentially fellow students, as well as other Miamians, have started widely referring to the Cubans of my Grandfather's generation, those who fled the Castro regime, and their children as 'gusanos' (Gusano meaning worm in English). They have also referred to their experience as 'immigrant light' because their immigration to this country was legal and that they weren't on the receiving end of 'racism.' The reason this is so appalling to me is that the term 'gusano' is actually the communist propaganda of the Castro Regime meant to create a divide among Cubans and discredit those who left. I have had my family attacked on social media for being educated, hard-working immigrants and told that they were most likely Batista sympathizers or worse. The authenticity of Cubans, especially ones who originally fled the Castro regime, as latinos and as immigrants is being questioned more and more which I believe to be mainly because they are widely Conservative. I am proud of my family and their achievements, accomplished despite their many obstacles, so I refuse to have their good name tarnished by today's community that is hell bent against those who are conservative. However, I worry that if I were to go on the offensive on this issue I could lose the scholarships I've worked so hard to earn if my University found out. What can I do to fight this intelligently and without bringing myself down to the whining, complaining nature of the left?”

Question: “After listening to your show with Dr. Adam Perkins, it seems to me that my daughter may fall into the category of people who have an employment-resistance personality. She is 16 years old, and throughout her life I've struggled with how to parent her affectively. Now that she's quickly approaching age 18, I worry that all my efforts will be for naught, and she will inevitably end up like her father's side of the family, dependent on others or the state. (she seems to share a lot of their genetic traits) Can you lend me some insight/advice about how to combat or curb these personality traits before it's too late?”

The already abysmal mainstream media has had a very rough start to the month. ABC’s Brian Ross reported that Gen. Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that candidate Donald Trump ordered him to make contact with the Russians - but that was fake news! Reuters reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for President Trump’s bank records – but that was fake news! CNN reported that the Trump Campaign was sent eventual Wikileaks documents before they were actually released – but that was fake news! On top of it, Beverly Nelson also admitted that she forged a portion of the infamous high school yearbook used as proof of her accusations against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore.

Question: “I work for a supplier that deals in electronics selling to large manufacturers. Recently this year I was told by a corporate purchasing manager that there is nothing she can do to maintain our business relationship as my company is not woman owned or classified as a diversity supplier. My contacts with this company run into the thousands worldwide, and the director who I was speaking with has a great deal of unchecked power. The company is a technology company, and I have worked with many women over my 23-year career all of whom are professional and have not harbored the least scrap of negativity toward me in my work, and I assume are assets to their teams. This perhaps is the greatest challenge to me in my career, we can always get a new customer and shame on me for creating a living off a multi-million-dollar account having kept most of my eggs in one basket. What does a man who works for a white male owned company do when his best fortune 50 customer says we no longer want to work with you because the company you work for is not classified as a diversity source?”

After many Republicans smeared Donald Trump, suggesting he was not a “real Republican” they were later revealed as Republicans in name only. When the mainstream media and Hollywood smeared Donald Trump as a sexual predator, they were later revealed to be hiding and protecting sexual predators. The FBI is investigating Donald Trump for corruption and collusion, and now have been revealed to be completely corrupt itself.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump/Russia collusion investigation came under criticism recently when FBI agent Peter Strzok was removed from duty due to fiercely anti-Trump text messages between him and his alleged lover FBI attorney Lisa Page. Peter Strzok previously changed former FBI Director James Comey's description of Hillary Clinton's actions from "grossly negligent" to "extremely careless,” interviewed Gen. Michael Fynn leading to eventual charges and also was heavily involved in the entire Hillary Clinton email scandal investigation.

Democrats and the modern left are melting down over the advancement of President Donald Trump's tax plan. Is President Donald Trump's tax plan a "scam" as liberals claim, or do they have other reasons for opposing it?

With hundreds of thousands estimated to be held in concentration camps, rampant starvation, endless threats of violence and cradle to grave propaganda, the North Korean people are living the equivalent of hell on earth.

With the emergence of Donald Trump, the reality of demographic displacement and voting patterns - the necessity and importance of the nation state in the battle against globalism is indisputable.

Question: “I was born in 1951, and that entitles me to the Boomer label, I am told. I am mystified as to why you speak so scathingly about this demographic. Could you expand on this for me, just so I understand this bias for my own future reference when it comes at me personally? I bring this up because, like many free-thinkers, I do not own what others assume about me, and it might be fun to talk with you, as a voice from outside the categories and statistics which you may or may not be referring to. I am also aware that your childhood traumas come from a mother who is probably a Boomer, so that explains the emotions I hear in your voice when you blame the Boomers for most of the ills of the world. For this, I have compassion. You are free to ask me anything about my childhood, my birthing and raising of children, my marriage, my post-menopausal reality, my livelihood(s), my political, spiritual, philosophical views. Perhaps you would agree that I am not really worthy of the Boomer label, except for my age, which I can do nothing about, nor feel ashamed of. A conversation about being old might be helpful for you too!”

In early November, the totalitarian regime of Nicolás Maduro issued a “decree” demanding “the refinancing and restructuring of the debt.” For those unaware as to the terms of economic obfuscation, that signaled a complete economic default which was unsurprising for anybody truly paying attention.

In the aftermath of Hillary Clinton’s State Department destroying Libya and the ensuing migrant crisis, there are currently open-slave markets ongoing in the middle-eastern country. The United Nations-backed Libyan Government of National Accord, or GNA, said Libya "is going through difficult times which affected its own citizens as well. It is, therefore, not fair to assume responsibility for the consequences of this immigration, which everyone unanimously agreed that addressing this phenomenon exceeds the national capacities. We affirm again that the practical solution is to address the real reasons that drive people to leave their home countries, treat them and develop final solutions for them.” Where is the outrage over modern-day slavery?

On November 19th, 2017, the infamous Manson family cult leader Charles Manson died at the age of 83. While discussing the Manson Family provokes flashbacks to the gruesome murders in August 1969 by Manson’s followers, very few people examine the backstory which leads to these types of tragedies. You cannot understand Charles Manson as an adult without understanding what happened to him in his childhood. What is the truth about Charles Manson?

John Conyers settled a wrongful dismissal complaint with a former employee who alleged she was fired because she would not “succumb to [his] sexual advances.” 

Mike Cernovich: "According to data released to Reid Wilson of The Hill, Congress has paid out as much as $4 million per fiscal year to women abused by Congressmen. Although these settlements are paid with taxpayer funds, the settlements are kept secret from the public."

If you are a human being with any conscientiousness, you’ve had an “oh s&!t” moment after realizing that you’ve made a mistake or created a problem. Stefan Molyneux describes a personal “oh s&!t” moment and wonders that how on a civilizational level, more individuals and leaders ignore the dangerous long-term consequences of their actions without any regard for other people.

In the wake of sexual assault scandals rocking Hollywood and the accusations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, Senator Al Franken has been accused of fondling Leeann Tweeden’s breasts while she was asleep and shoving his tongue down her throat during a “skit” without her consent. Unlike the Roy Moore allegations, Tweeden provided photographic proof of the then 55-year old Franken grabbing her breasts while she slept during a December 2006 USO tour.

Watch Tommy Robinson: http://www.tommyrobinson.com/watch

Over the weekend, Tommy Robinson was in Warsaw, Poland to attend the country's Independence Day march - a celebration of Poland's 99 years of independence from Russia. While the mainstream media claimed that 60,000 far-right Nazis took to the streets preaching racism and division, the reality of the march was much different. Tommy Robinson joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss his firsthand experience in Poland, the mainstream media’s distortion of the independence celebration, the suffering of communism producing a gratitude for freedom and the state of the European Union. 

Tommy Robinson is the Founder and ex Leader of the English Defence League (EDL), the author of the bestselling books “Enemy of the State” and “Mohammed's Koran” and the host of The Tommy Robinson Show on Rebel Media.

"Scott Adams was one of the earliest public figures to predict Trump’s win, doing so a week after Nate Silver put Trump’s odds at 2 percent in his FiveThirtyEight.com blog. The mainstream media regarded Trump as a novelty and a sideshow. But Adams recognized in Trump a level of persuasion you only see once in a generation."

"Trump triggered massive cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias on both the left and the right. We’re hardwired to respond to emotion, not reason. We might listen to 10 percent of a speech—a hand gesture here, a phrase there—and if the right buttons are pushed, we decide we agree with the speaker and invent reasons to justify that decision after the fact. The point isn’t whether Trump was right or wrong, good or bad. Win Bigly goes beyond politics to look at persuasion tools that can work in any setting—the same ones Adams saw in Steve Jobs when he invested in Apple decades ago."

Scott Adams is the creator of the widely popular Dilbert comic strip that is published daily in thousands of newspapers across the world, he is the author of many bestselling books including “How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life” and "Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don't Matter." Adams is also a trained hypnotist and an expert in the field of persuasion.

Question: "Being someone on the far right who consumes a lot of information on a daily basis, how do I prevent having a constant feeling of anxiety about the future of my people, when every day I am either bombarded by news of European people suffering from the effects of the migrant crisis (grooming rings, unsafe schools, working class families being pushed into poverty etc.) or have to reconcile myself with our inevitable demographic decline and the abandonment of our European homelands to invaders from the Third World? I already moved from Germany to Eastern Europe, to at least have some peace of mind by not having to live in the midst of all this degeneration and civilizational decay. Yet I can't opt out of seeing the Sword of Damocles above so many things I love and care for. This feeling often prevents me from enjoying my daily life, which actually isn't bad, and makes most of my conversations with friends inevitably turn political. Stefan and I might not have the exact same world view, but I would like to know how he, as a professional political commentator who does see some of the same dangers looming on the horizon, would recommend to deal with this kind of anxiety?"

Question: “I am an Australian, Christian, currently in university. My question is on the hot topics in our society is for last 13 years, marriage equality. It has been a long at times pointless roundabout debate which often devolves into name calling and accusations of bigotry. Now my alternative to this is removing marriage altogether as a government institution, that it becomes a tradition done within the community; this historically and religiously was its original intent. The alternative way of circumventing this issue is civil unions. This is legally similar to marriage without the load religious undertone; if the individuals want the marriage ceremony, they can then do this in what ever manner they want. Put plainly rather than a debate about marriage equality; the third alternative is the removal of government from marriage eliminating the issue altogether. When I discuss this as an option to people, it is either side step, ignored, or they don't seem to understand this as a conceptual way of approaching the issue. I am wondering is this a valid option I can campaign for in my community? If so what is the best way to construct it as a concrete argument, not as a much as moral one but a logical way of approaching the issue?”

Question: “I am an engineering student and am required to take a class about social advocacy and ethics. My instructor has been pushing a lot of anti-capitalism sentiments and pro-Marxist arguments and I was wondering if you could help me understand these arguments as they don't make a lot of sense to me; since I study engineering I don't have much of a background in philosophy or economics. 1) The idea that capitalism operates under exploitation, such as how a wage earner must produce more than they are paid and the employer gets to keep the excess, thus the laborer is exploited. There's a sort of subservience, my instructor argues, that is inherent in wages which is part of this exploitative system. 2) There's this idea of a Repressive State Apparatus (RSA), that the state uses various institutions to reinforce the ideas of exploitation on its populace. This is accompanied by the idea that the population has to be compliant and subservient to the capitalist system that exploits them.”

As a nation prepared to celebrate Halloween with fun costumes and delicious treats, 29-year-old Uzbekistan immigrant Sayfullo Saipov plowed a rented truck into countless pedestrians and rammed a school bus in New York City. Having entered the United States through the Diversity Visa Lottery, Saipov screamed ‘Allahu Akbar’ during the terrorist attack and carried a note pledging allegiance to the Islamic State.

"No Go Zones. That's what they're called. And while the politically correct try to deny their existence, the shocking reality of these "No Go Zones"—where Sharia law can prevail and local police stay away—can be attested to by its many victims."

"Now Raheem Kassam, a courageous reporter and editor at Breitbart.com, takes us where few journalists have dared to tread—inside the No Go Zones, revealing areas that Western governments, including the United States, don't want to admit exist within their own borders."

"With compelling reporting, Kassam takes you into Islamic areas you might not even know existed—communities, neighborhoods, and whole city districts from San Bernardino, California, (a No Go Zone of the mind) to Hamtramck, Michigan (essentially an Islamic colony in the Midwest); from Malmö, Sweden, to the heart of London, England—where infidels are unwelcome, Islamic law is king, and extremism grows."

Raheem Kassam is the Editor in Chief of Breitbart London, a senior distinguished fellow at the Gatestone Institute and the author of “No Go Zones: How Sharia Law Is Coming to a Neighborhood Near You.”

The now-infamous “Golden Showers” dossier has Fusion GPS in the spotlight as serious questions are raised about who funded the largely discredited or unverified allegations against Donald Trump and his campaign associates. 

In April 2016, the Hillary Clinton Campaign and the Democratic National Committee used lawyer Marc Elias to retain and fund Fusion GPS for opposition research, leading to the “Golden Showers” dossier.

In June 2016, former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and his company Orbis Business Intelligence are hired by Fusion GPS to specifically investigate Trump’s possible connections to Russia. What is the truth about the Fusion GPS dossier collusion scandal?

Question: “It seems an inevitable trend in culture for men and women to continue to separate into what looks like a clear fact/value split. This complicates and most likely prevents the potential for healing between the sexes. I have been working to understand the history and reasoning behind feminism and discouraged to find men and women growing more distant from one another. In light of these facts, how likely do you see a return for men to their traditional roles, where they are 'drawn back into family life...convinced that being a good husband and father is a manly thing to do; that parental duty and sacrifice are masculine virtues; that marital love and fidelity are not female standards imposed upon men externally, but an integral part of the male character--something inherent and original?' What would it take for men to realize and live out this truth?”

Question: “I have had my reservations about child abuse, and for those who have heard too many euphemisms, I am referring to, “inducement of pain in children to correct behavior”. On one side, I have: Common American culture which has been working, for the most part, for quite a while which includes what they like to call corporal punishment. On the other side I have: 1) All of the people who study it saying that it causes actual brain damage 2) The ever-awesome Freedomain Radio which makes an extraordinarily compelling case.”

“When I read once that child abuse causes loss in IQ, I immediately sided against it due to my own beliefs about IQ. When I talk about child abuse with someone who does have a child, I have a clear disadvantage and my views are immediately discounted because I do not yet have children. Honestly, it is not my goal to convince them to stop beating their children, it is my goal to come to a clear conclusion myself. What can we say to those many parents who dismiss me when I speak against child abuse?”

After threats of leftist domestic terrorism due to a pro-President Donald Trump Facebook post, an Arizona restaurant was essentially forced to close its doors and fold the business. The owners of Cup it Up American Grill in Tucson, Christopher Smith and Jay Warren, took the controversial positions of supporting standing for the National Anthem, first responders, the United States Armed Forces and the Bill of Rights – and faced a severe backlash.

Recently the New York Times published an expose on Harvey Weinstein alleging sexual harassment and assault allegations from multiple women over a significant period of time. In the days following the article's publication, additional allegations, including rape, emerged causing Weinstein to be fired from the Weinstein Company and disavowed by many in Hollywood and politics.

Over a year after the United Kingdom's European Union Referendum where the democratic vote proved that citizens wanted their country to regain their sovereignty - it appears that a massive betrayal has occurred. As Brexiteers and Remainers debate about leaving the single market, it appears open borders immigration policy will continue far into the future.

On October 1st, 2017 at approximately 10pm, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock used a hammer-like implement to smash two windows in his 32nd floor suite at of the Mandalay Bay casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Outside the smashed windows, a crowd of approximately 22,000 had gathered for the Route 91 Harvest country music festival – inside were several gun tripods, 23 different firearms - some with scopes, others with bump-stock devices - and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Bump stocks are legal accessories that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire at rates approaching that of fully automatic weapons.

At 10:08pm, Police reported receiving the first call of shots fired at the country music festival and 72 minutes later Paddock was found dead in his room by the responding SWAT team. 

During those 72 minutes, 58 people were murdered, 489 were injured and the lives of thousands were irreparably damaged forever as a result of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.

On October 1st, 2017, the territorial unity of Spain faced a challenge as the Catalan regional government staged its promised and controversial independence referendum. Despite the referendum being “suspended” by Spain’s constitutional court and fiercely opposed by the central government.

Out of a possible 5.3 million voters in the region, 2,262,424 people voted in the referendum for a turnout of 42%. An estimated 770,000 votes were lost due to disruption or seizure by the Spanish police, and 79 of the 2,315 polling stations were closed. With 2,020,144 “YES” votes, or 90% of the total, and 176,565 “NO” votes – the Catalan voters overwhelmingly supported independence. 

The regional government previously promised to officially declare independence within 48 hours of the referendum, with the results of the election being sent to the parliament.

Question: “I am a 39-year-old small town attorney. I have been practicing for a little less than four years. As both a law student and legal practitioner I have become increasingly aware and fascinated by the interplay between law and freedom. In the interest of full disclosure, I am not an anarchist. I believe some laws are necessary to protect the citizens’ freedom however I am opposed to the growing number of civil and criminal laws aimed at penalizing and curbing self-injurious behaviors by adults. While I would acknowledge that most of these laws are certainly within the scope of constitutional authority granted to the States and the Federal government I maintain that these types of laws represent bad policy and a growing infringement on the citizens’ personal liberty. What are your thoughts on this subject?”

Question: “I am a 21-year-old girl who is in college studying to be a civil engineer. However, I do not wish to be in college, nor do I wish to have such a demanding career. Everyone tells me that I need to go to college and get a good job; but why? Ever since I was 3 years old, all I have ever wanted to be was a mother; a stay at home mother. The man I am with now is 37 and does not believe he makes enough money to support me and the 4 children I want to have. We have been, and lived, together for 2 years now, but I am considering breaking up with him because it doesn’t seem likely that he will give me the life I want. He also doesn’t believe in God and that really bothers me. Am I being shallow by thinking this? Should these factors be deciding factors in the future of my life?”

Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3840-the-truth-about-the-sen-bob-menendez-corruption-trial

New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez and Dominican Republic born ophthalmologist Dr. Salomon Melgen were indicted on public corruption and bribery charges on April 1, 2015. Only two weeks later on April 15, Melgen was also indicted on Medicare fraud charges. At the center of the corruption trial is the long-standing mutually-beneficial relationship between Menendez and Melgen.

Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez is the first United States senator on trial for corruption in 36 years and faces six counts of bribery, three counts of honest services fraud, one count of conspiracy, one count of interstate travel to carry out bribery, and one count of making false statements on his congressional financial disclosures to conceal the criminal activity. Melgen faces the same charges, except for the charge related to congressional financial disclosures.

If Menendez is convicted and forced out of office before January, current New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie would be responsible for picking his replacement – likely meaning another temporary GOP vote from a state which has not elected a Republican Senator since 1972.

Congressman Steve King was elected to Congress in 2002 and currently represents Iowa’s Fourth Congressional District. Rep. King serves on many committees – including the Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee.

While it is commonly understood that various personality traits are largely genetic - many are unwilling to examine how this influences culture and sexual market value. Stefan Molyneux puts the biological nature of culture in perspective and how it ultimately leads to the spread of ideas in the sexual marketplace.

Stefan Molyneux and Steven Crowder sit down to debate this controversial topic in the latest of our ongoing mock debate series.

Question: “I am having a crisis of what to do about my relationship with the black community. While my family are certainly not full of Michael Browns and Trayvon Martins, they are excruciatingly liberal and completely intolerant of any other viewpoints. I know there is no real future with this type of thinking and it reminds me of Dr. Ben Carson recently saying that poor people are poor because they think poor.”

“I have on one hand Dr. Walter Williams, Thomas Sowell, Larry Elder and Jesse Lee Peterson telling me that the problem is cultural and can be fixed and Jared Taylor on the other hand telling me that the IQ level for blacks makes blacks more prone to criminality and that the culture cannot be mended across racial lines. In the meanwhile the dramatic reduction of price of DNA testing combined with extremely hostile foreigners introduced to our population has finally given rise to race being a reality and not a social construct.

“The black community that rejected me long ago for ‘speaking and acting white’ now rebukes me for leaving the black community once I started making good money and reminds me that it is the responsibility of people like me to fix everything. It is time (way past time) for me to start creating children and what am I giving them? What society am I giving my black children? What burdens am I forcing upon them?”

On September 24th, 2017 at approximately 11:15 am, 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson targeted the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, Tennessee. Wearing a neoprene ski mask and carrying two pistols, Samson fatally wounded Melanie Smith Crow, 39, in the church parking lot, before entering the church and opening fire into the crowd of 42 patrons - wounding 6 others between the ages of 60 and 83. 

Church Usher Robert Engle confronted the shooter and was pistol-whipped before Samson shot himself during the skirmish. With the suspect disabled, Engle is reported to have retrieved a legal firearm from his vehicle and guarded the shooter until police arrived on scene. Originally from Sudan, Emanuel Kidega Samson was brought to the United States in 1996 when he was only 5 years old. Samson is a legal United States resident, but not necessarily a U.S. citizen. Samson will be charged with both murder and multiple counts of attempted murder.

Question: “Given the amount of income inequality in the United States today, critics almost always cite the ever-nefarious force behind it all: corporate greed. After a debate I recently had, I began to question whether or not ‘greed’ was even a valid concept or simply something subjectively ascribed to those with - from those without. How can we establish what and how much people ‘need’ and when/if that consumption becomes ‘greed?’”

Question: "Years ago I was in an abusive relationship and now I struggle with anxiety and depression. Then, in the last few years the SJW era began, which I feel essentially compounded my post-abuse condition due to its key feature of bullying and hating. I’m always so wrapped up in how I’m viewed and I'm hyper critical of myself all the time. I take everything personally and always worry whether I'm doing something wrong. It's also left me feeling jaded and bitter about the world. How can I stop criticizing myself so much and stop all these unproductive feelings?"

Question: “I had a debate with my Pastor a few days ago -- about Capitalism, the free market and the poor. As Christians we are supposed to be concerned about the weakest among us and help them. I see a free market as a way to helping people -- and as the ultimate in ‘free will’ but he can't see past his belief that Capitalism exploits the poor. How do you convince another Christian that it is immoral to support a large government - because if takes away our ‘God Given’ free will? And what arguments can I use to show that a free society will not only restore ‘free will’ but will benefit the poor as well?”

Question: "I’m an ex-muslim middle eastern immigrant, I’ve noticed a lot of parallels in the rise of tyranny back home and the rise of tyranny in the west. Obviously, as I chose to be in the west now, this concerns me but not for my own sake. After attempting to relate these thoughts with others, whether those back home or my new neighbours, people are often skeptical of my observations. Despite watching things regress in the last few years to an obvious, almost painful, degree I feel like my observations are only getting more validated despite not earning legitimacy in the public sphere. A big aspect of this is having both the left and the right perceiving me as the other, the far right viewing me no different from those that seek to destroy the west and the far left viewing me no different than those that seek to discriminate against muslims, how do I reconcile this and earn my place in this shaky society? Is there no more room for nuance?"

"Over this time I’ve also come to realize the importance of balancing tradition but maintaining an open mind and I think both forms of societies have pros and cons. How can we redirect the conversation from eliminating the other side into synthesizing? The biggest catastrophe that has hit the west since WW2 in my estimation is the death of (and on-going war on) the family and it genuinely sadness me, on the other hand things are far too rigid back home and the concept of family can almost be suffocating."

The DREAM Act was originally introduced [and actually passed the House] in 2001 and different versions of the bill have been regularly reintroduced in the Senate and House. 

This heavily pushed amnesty bill would legalize illegal aliens brought - or claiming to be brought - to the United States as minors and provide them with a path to permanent legal status. A path to outright citizenship is also being discussed.

The DREAM Act very different from DACA – and pro-amnesty sophists purposefully conflate the two for propaganda purposes.
There are two active versions of the DREAM Act right now – one in the Senate and another in the House. While very similar in language, they contain different criteria for eligibility. 

According to the most recent numbers, approximately 690,000 illegal aliens are protected under DACA. Another 100,000 or so qualified for DACA previously, but failed to renew, were deported due to criminal activity or used an immigration law loophole to gain a green card. How do these numbers compare to what is proposed under the DREAM Act?

President Donald Trump's controversial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals [DACA] repeal has lead to significant fallout across the political spectrum. The decision to phase out the unconstitutional executive order came as U.S. States planned to challenge DACA in court if the Trump administration had not acted.

Stefan Molyneux is joined by Styxhexenhammer666 to debate President Trump's decision, the push for Congress to pass The DREAM Act to replace DACA, the reality of demographic change in the United States and what this means for the Trump administration moving forward.

The mere mention of South Africa in a discussion provokes deep images of institutional racism, discrimination and horrific violence.

"The welfare state has a problem: each generation living under its protection has lower work motivation than the previous one. In order to fix this problem we need to understand its causes, lest the welfare state ends up undermining its own economic and social foundations."

"In The Welfare Trait, award-winning personality researcher Dr Adam Perkins argues that welfare-induced personality mis-development is a significant part of the problem. In support of his theory, Dr Perkins presents data showing that the welfare state can boost the number of children born into disadvantaged households, and that childhood disadvantage promotes the development of an employment-resistant personality profile, characterised by aggressive, antisocial and rule-breaking tendencies."

"The book concludes by recommending that policy should be altered so that the welfare state no longer increases the number of children born into disadvantaged households. It suggests that, without this change, the welfare state will erode the nation's work ethic by increasing the proportion of individuals in the population who possess an employment-resistant personality profile, due to exposure to the environmental influence of disadvantage in childhood."

Dr. Adam Perkins is a Lecturer in the Neurobiology of Personality at King's College London and the author of “The Welfare Trait: How State Benefits Affect Personality.”

On May 11, 2011, then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reintroduced the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors [DREAM] Act into the Senate. The DREAM Act would have given conditional residency and more to non-adult illegal immigrants – but it failed to pass. On June 15, 2012, President Barack Obama announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals [DACA] - an executive order which bypassed lawmakers and offered similar legal status to an estimated 1.7 million illegal immigrants. 

In June 2017, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and others announced plans to challenge DACA in court if the Trump administration has not agreed to phase out the program by September 5th, 2017. On September 5, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA was being repealed – and that implementation will be suspended for six months.

Following an a meeting at the White House, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi jointly announced that “We agreed to enshrine the protections of DACA into law quickly, and to work out a package of border security, excluding the wall, that’s acceptable to both sides.”

After an immediate uproar from the conservative base following the Schumer/Pelosi announcement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted that “While DACA and border security were both discussed, excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to.” Will President Donald Trump betray those who elected him and support DACA amnesty?

Question: “I have been listening to your podcasts for about 1 year and my husband has listened to some of them recently. I have started reading real time relationships and am about half way through. I have already been hit with many truths most of which are physically painful. I am contacting you because I feel time is running short for our marriage and I cannot pretend anymore. I have tried to speak with my husband many times about this but he avoids it and or doesn't understand what I mean. I don't want to break up our children's home and damage them even more. I have many regrets about the kind of mother I have been even though I swore I wouldn't be like mine. My objective with contacting you is to try and minimize any further damage to my children and to survive my marriage. There is no physical or verbal abuse in our marriage but we avoid everything that may bring a conflict. It is fake. To sum up our relationship you can substitute our names for ‘Bruce and Sheila’ in Real Time Relationships. I know you can't tell us what to do but I feel you could give us or even just myself the kick in the ass we need. I know that we avoid any conflict because if we were really honest with each other and our families, everything we have would come crashing down. This terrifies me.”

Question: “I can't stand my sister's boyfriend. He's 27 and my sister is 20. We have the same ethnic background and I've known his parents for over 10 years. Initially I was alright with him, I found him a bit weird but I felt relief because I knew his parents well. As it currently stands, they've been in a relationship for 1 year. Throughout this time I've found him to be a very impulsive, superficial and fake person. I think he is a negative influence on my sister and dread contact with him. A virtue I value strongly is that of being a genuine and honest person. It's very easy for me to fake being friendly with him and avoid conflict but I don't like acting contrary to my true feelings. I was hoping you can give some insight on how one should behave with someone they dislike that they can't avoid.”

Question: “I’m 28 years old, divorced, musician and a serial fixer. Over the past decade I have had several long relationships with broken women. Somehow I've always knew that it would be a challenge but I dove deep nonetheless hoping that it would work. Now the next ‘victim’ is a hooker living 4000 miles away from me. I don’t know if I'm stupid or a masochist. What drives me to put so much energy and time into those relationships?”

Question: "Will we eventually have to go back in, with boots on the ground, to the countries - or failed states - in the Middle East, Afghanistan and elsewhere, whose problems we may not have created entirely but have certainly contributed to, in order to avert the existential threat we face in the West and also to deliver safe, civilized, worthwhile lives to the people living in these countries? In short - and I know this is an Oxymoron - should we be planning to impose freedom and civilization on these people for their own good and for our security in the long term?"

Question: "I am a former Antifa-style anarchist. In 2011, I was part of the Occupy movement, but in 2016 I voted for Trump after a long and difficult intellectual journey from radical Leftism to Conservatism. My hope now is to help other people trapped in the Radical Left to de-hypnotize themselves. Do you have any thoughts on how to do this, or any advice on how to transition back into society?”

On August 20th at an America First rally in Laguna Beach, California, President Trump supporter R.C. Maxwell was violently assaulted by Alt-Left Antifa counter-protesters. Maxwell - who had his red Make America Great Again hat - believes that he was targeted simply for being a “black conservative.”

Are we better in a state of nature, before authority brings down the hammer on "misbehavior"? Do you ever yearn for a simple life, deep in the woods, free of social constraints? What do you think would happen to us all in the absence of the rule of law? Would we learn to cooperate, or end up fighting endlessly? Dr. Duke Pesta joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss the ancient idea of an earthly paradise that existed before the fall of man. What was it really like? Better, or worse? Where would you prefer to live?

Question: “On September 6th, 1996, my mother was murdered. To this day the case remains unsolved. The same goes for every day of my life since then. For the past 20 years I have felt like I have been wandering the earth aimlessly. I have managed to do the ‘normal’ things like marriage (and subsequent divorce) and children but I have lacked the drive and focus needed to achieve the goals I had once set for myself. Throughout my adult life I have always felt like no matter what I do I can never seem to outrun my past. It's like I can feel, and I believe in my heart, that there is something great out there for me and that hope alone is what has kept me motivated to keep going through all of the things that seem to get dumped on my plate on what seems like a daily basis. How much truth is there to the idea that my past is controlling my future and what thought processes can I use to overcome the things that have happened to me and shed these chains?”

Question: “I am a Christian who believes in God and has had several very deep and profound spiritual experiences including speaking in tongues, involuntary shaking, feeling ‘the love of God’ pulsate throughout my body in waves, strangers speaking things to me as if it were God speaking to me, etc. I fully acknowledge that I am unable to reasonably defend my faith against arguments such as ‘there is no empirical evidence of God’, ‘the bible is full of contradictions’, etc. but I find myself still drawn to the faith and have no desire to leave it. With everything else in my life, I look to evidence, reason, and data except for this one thing which oddly enough is the one thing that gives me a deep sense of peace, comfort, and joy. Am I, therefore, unreasonable to hold these seemingly contradictory positions?”

Question: “I am a 21-year old jazz musician and play music at a very high level for my age. However, I happen to hold a number of political views which run counter to the mainstream ideology of the jazz community. The community is rather small, interconnected, and for the most part politically homogenous, so if word got out that I don't support Black Lives Matter for example, my future as a musician could be permanently ruined. Inevitably I will be forced to either lie about my views, or tell the truth and forever become an evil racist in the eyes of my peers. Is telling the truth always the best option, even at the expense of a lifetime of career opportunities?”

Showing the lack of respect they have for the intelligence of their audience, the mainstream media often attaches "bucket" labels to criticize individuals instead of using actual arguments. Stefan Molyneux looks at a recent Business Insider article which called Ann Coulter, Mike Cernovich, Steve Bannon's Breitbart and himself "Far-Right" while describing their opposition to the war in Afghanistan. Who knew that opposing war and western imperialism was a far-right position!

One of the most important discussions taking place in the world today relates to human inequality. While many people view outcome inequality as a problem in need of solving, others strive to increase the equality of opportunity instead. Stefan Molyneux breaks down the struggle between equality of outcome and equality of opportunity.

“Is it possible for Atheism to explain the existence of objective morality: subject-independent - things are right or wrong independently of whether anyone believes them to be so? How is your morality (Universally Preferable Behavior) objective - obligatory to all - for all people at all times? How would UPB apply to, say, Genghis Khan? It strikes me that UPB morality does not address the personal ethics internal to a single moral agent, only transactional ethics between a plurality of moral agents in most cases.”

Afghanistan is an expensive disaster for the United States of America.

A rented truck was driven through a popular tourist street in Barcelona - leaving over ten people dead and approximately one-hundred injured - in the latest terrorist attack to hit Europe. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack with one suspect dead and another two in custody. In the shadows of Charlottesville - which saw James Fields drive his Dodge Challenger through a crowd of protesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring 19 others – Stefan Molyneux makes a plea for conversation, de-escalation and non-violence.

Book Summary: "Dinesh D'Souza explodes the Left's big lie. He expertly exonerates President Trump and his supporters, then uncovers the Democratic Left's long, cozy relationship with Nazism: how the racist and genocidal acts of early Democrats inspired Adolf Hitler's campaign of death; how fascist philosophers influenced the great 20th century lions of the American Left; and how today's anti-free speech, anti-capitalist, anti-religious liberty, pro-violence Democratic Party is a frightening simulacrum of the Nazi Party."

Dinesh D'Souza is the author of the #1 New York Times bestsellers Hillary's America and America: Imagine a World Without Her. His other best-selling books include Obama's America, The Roots of Obama's Rage, What's So Great About America, What's So Great About Christianity, Life After Death, Illiberal Education and now “The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left.”

When people stop talking, inevitably, unfortunately and predictably violence escalates. Virginia Gov. Terry McAullife declared a state of emergency leading to riot police shutting down the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The violence escalated from there with many being pepper sprayed, hit with rocks, physically assaulted and most shockingly - event attendee James Alex Fields, Jr. drove a vehicle into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing at least one person and leaving countless more injured.

"When high speed internet became widely available a few years ago, growing numbers of people began to worry that their porn use was running out of control. Far from preparing them for fulfilling relationships, viewing an endless stream of porn videos led to unexpected symptoms. Perhaps most surprisingly, for the first time in history erectile dysfunction was becoming a significant problem for young men."

"This led to one of the largest informal experiments in the history of science. Tens of thousands of people have tried abstaining from sexually stimulating material in a process they call ‘rebooting’. Many of them reported startling changes, from improved concentration and elevated mood to a greater capacity for real-life intimacy. Gary Wilson has listened to the stories of those who have tried giving up internet porn and related them to an account of how the reward system of the brain interacts with its environment. And now a growing body of research in neuroscience is confirming what these pioneers have discovered for themselves – internet pornography can be seriously addictive and damaging."

"In Your Brain on Porn Wilson provides a concise introduction to the phenomenon of internet porn addiction that draws on both first-person accounts and the findings of cognitive neuroscience. In a voice that is generous and humane, he also offers advice for those who want to stop using internet pornography."

Gary Wilson is the author of “Your Brain on Porn: Internet Pornography and the Emerging Science of Addiction.”

Former Google employee James Damore describes the intense media backlash to his Google diversity memo, intolerance shown towards political diversity in the company, the importance of discussing gender differences and why he wrote the memo in the first place.

Question: “Though I'm fairly self-aware, in my relationship there are issues that are rooted in my own insecurities, the biggest issue being jealousy. I feel so jealous all the time because I feel inferior to other women (mostly physically), and this stresses me out in every way it possibly could. Not only do I already feel bad about myself because of how I am, but I also feel bad about the way that I treat my partner, because I never want him to stress about anything. I've gone so far as to avoid going out and participating in certain activities with him because I don't want to risk him being around a woman that would be more attractive than myself. Although I've listened in and gotten a few ideas as to why my mind functions this way, I can't feel confident enough in my reasoning to move forward and properly handle the issue. So, for the sake of my partnership, what is causing these insecurities and how do I use this knowledge to prevent the downfall of my love life?”

McMaster is purging Trump supporters from the National Security Committee while rubber stamping unmasking Susan Rice's future security clearance.

President Donald Trump has ended a long-standing CIA program supported by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain which funded anti-Assad rebels in Syria. These United States government funded, armed and trained rebels were recorded beheading a young child in 2016, but until Donald Trump came along, nobody had the decency to end the terrorist funding.

Non-Cultural Appropriated Film Synopsis: "In May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, 330,000 French, British, Belgian and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated."

I watched my parents, especially my dad struggle with how to reach her. I tried to help her when I could, but she often rejected my help. I have an 8-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter. I am demonstrating my love for my wife and building my relationship with my son and daughter. I am leading my family so that they understand what a good husband and father looks like. I am teaching my daughter to set expectations for her curfew so that she knows it is for her benefit. At around 16 I expect her to bring her date home so that I can have a conversation with him, my bat and shotgun in hand, and set ground rules for their time together. There are lines in our society that have changed and yet I believe like you that we must be the village elders that protect our family and other women from aggressive men and their own poor choices.”

On February 2nd, 2017, Democrat-hired informational technology workers Abid Awan, Imran Awan, Jamal Awan, Hina Alvi and Natalia Sova were barred from the House of Representatives computer networks. The Awan family members are currently under criminal investigation by U.S. Capitol Police after it was discovered that congressional information was being “funneled” to an off-site server and various equipment had been stolen. Due to the nature of their work, the suspects had full access to the emails and sensitive documents of dozens of congressional members who employed them - including multiple members of the homeland security, foreign affairs and intelligence committees.

Christians are being ethnically cleansed throughout the Middle East, but the mainstream media simply isn’t interested in covering this horrific story. Ezra Levant joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss his recent trip to Northern Iraq to visit with Christian refugees, terrorists destroying Christian towns, why Christians cannot go to United Nations refugee camps and what can be done to help save Middle Eastern Christians from this onslaught. 

Ezra Levant is a journalist and the founder of TheRebel Media, Canada’s largest independent news network. He is the author of “Shakedown: How Our Government is Undermining Democracy in the Name of Human Rights” and “Trumping Trudeau: How Donald Trump will change Canada even if Justin Trudeau doesn't know it yet.”

While the Trump administration and conservative media talk about decreasing unemployment and the addition of new jobs - it's important to remember that there is another less optimistic side to the story. While the official unemployment rate is very low - many 
healthy working age people have simply left the workforce and quit looking for jobs.

A recent Pew Research survey showed that 47% of liberal Democrats said that a friend's support for President Donald Trump would put a strain on the relationship compared to only 13% of Republicans related to a friend's support of Hillary Clinton. While many people use this survey to chastise leftists about their "intolerance," this only shows their true commitment to their beliefs and the winning side is often populated by those who are the most committed.

Description: MP3: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3754/objective-ethics-in-15-minutes-universally-preferable-behaviour-upb
Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3754-objective-ethics-in-15-minutes-universally-preferable-behaviour-upb

For thousands of years, humanity has attempted to enforce ethics through supernatural and secular punishments; this rabid aggression has been both necessary and ridiculous. It has been necessary because a rational proof of secular ethics has never been achieved; it has been ridiculous because it is impossible to imagine any scientific or mathematical argument being advanced in such a hysterical and violent manner.

“Ethics” has been one of the great government programs of history; since kings and priests ruled mankind, only those philosophers who served their interests tended to get promoted to prominence, rather than imprisoned, poisoned or burned. Thus, over 2,500 years since its inception, the discipline of ethics remains largely subjectivist, relativist and cultural – and was not only unable to restrain, but may have played a part in promoting the horrors, wars and genocides of the 20th century, the bloodiest hundred years of history of our species.

Stefan Molyneux has written "Universally Preferable Behavior: A Rational Proof of Secular Ethics,” which presents radical and rational arguments for a nonreligious, non-statist, entirely secular set ethical standards which validate the nonaggression principle – thou shalt not initiate force against thy fellow human – and the fundamental logic for respecting property rights.

Rigorous, analytical and challenging, “Universally Preferable Behavior” provides a solid foundation for secular ethics. This book solves the ancient philosopher Petrarch’s dichotomy, which is that it is better to will the good than know the truth. Armed with the arguments in “Universally Preferable Behavior,” you can both know the truth and will the good.

The Wrath of the Awakened Saxon by Rudyard Kipling

It was not part of their blood,
It came to them very late,
With long arrears to make good,
When the Saxon began to hate.

They were not easily moved,
They were icy -- willing to wait
Till every count should be proved,
Ere the Saxon began to hate.

Their voices were even and low.
Their eyes were level and straight.
There was neither sign nor show
When the Saxon began to hate.

It was not preached to the crowd.
It was not taught by the state.
No man spoke it aloud
When the Saxon began to hate.

It was not suddently bred.
It will not swiftly abate.
Through the chilled years ahead,
When Time shall count from the date
That the Saxon began to hate.

Over a year after the United Kingdom's European Union Referendum where the democratic vote proved that citizens wanted their country to regain their sovereignty - it appears that a massive betrayal has occurred. As Brexiteers and Remainers debate about leaving the single market, it appears open borders immigration policy will continue far into the future.

One of the oldest problems of philosophy is proving the validity of objective reality - how do you know that your waking life is not also a dream? Hundreds of years ago, René Descartes wrestled with this problem – that we might just be a "brain in a tank" being manipulated by some demon for his own devilish fun!

If you've ever been told that "nothing is objective" and "truth is relative" and "everything is subjective" - or ever doubted the validity of your senses, you desperately need arguments against this mad perspective! Take 10 minutes, gain a lifetime of sanity and defense against the dark arts of sophistry!

While many are unaware of the coming demographic winter in the United States, the future of freedom in the country will be decided by President Donald Trump's immigration policy. With 11-30+ million illegal immigrants in the United States, an endless flow of refugees and unskilled legal immigrants, who are statistically shown to favor larger government, unless things change, this will prevent small government ideas from being politically viable for the far and foreseeable future.

Peter Brimelow is the founder and editor of VDARE.com and the author of several books including “Alien Nation: Common Sense About America’s Immigration Disaster” and “The Worm in the Apple: How the Teacher Unions Are Destroying American Education.”

Question: “I was recently suspended from my university for a joke I made back in January with my fraternity brothers. I not only lost a full ride scholarship, but also any chance I had of getting into law school because of this. I understand why people adhere to PC culture passively, but why, when it is clear that it causes direct harm, do people (university staff, in my case) still act as though it is the moral high ground?”

Description: Many Democrats believe that Russian hackers targeted the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, providing private information about Hillary Clinton to Wikileaks which ultimately swung the U.S. Presidential election to Donald Trump. If we accept this theory as true, Stefan Molyneux puts it into the proper perspective and highlights it's outright absurdity.

The New York Times recently reported on a meeting Donald Trump, Jr. had with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016 – alleging that this shows proof of collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign to “hack” the U.S. Presidential election. The allegations revolve around an email exchange between publicist Rob Goldstone and Donald Trump, Jr. related to Veselnitskaya having opposition research on Hillary Clinton, suggesting that Russian individuals were illegally funding the Democratic National Committee. Is this the smoking gun the Democrats have been waiting for which proves their Trump/Russia collusion narrative?

Question: "Many young people, including myself, have run into the issue of choice paralysis when it comes to a long term career. This, combined with the lie of 'just follow your dreams' they spoon feed to students in schools and the breakdown of the nuclear family support system, leaves many teenagers and young adults an array of paths with little to no direction. The issue seems to be more present in the modern day than in generations long since past. Is it caution or coddling by our parents that has stunted our ability to be successful? Is it the lack of training or knowledge of the adult world? Is it the habitual or addictive nature of present day entertainment that we pour hours upon hours into? Or is it something simpler than it appears? What can we as millennials do to cure, or stunt the growth of, our choice paralysis in the modern day, and prevent it from greatly affecting our future children?"

Question: “What does it mean to be an evil person, and how do you distinguish an evil person from someone reacting to a traumatic past? For most of my life I grew up believing no one was really evil, but rather it was the harsh circumstances of one’s life that cornered people into evil actions. I believe this moral relativism is something our culture and government embeds into our beliefs at a young age because if we cannot recognize evil we cannot begin to fight against it.”

Question: “My parents were divorced 2 years ago, and in the process I witnessed my father become a shadow of his former self. Now, all around me I see what appear to be broken men and emasculated young boys. Anyone listening to your show should know the causes of this ‘Fall of Man’, the consequences of which are deep, personal, and far-reaching. In this era, what can a youth like myself do to be a ‘real man’ amid such hostility towards masculinity and animosity towards the traditional concept of manliness?”

Question: "On this 150th Canadian anniversary, I asked myself the following question: what is Canada? It may be because I am from Québec, but I am unable to provide an answer. I concluded that Canada is, in essence, legal fiction. It seems to me to be a country that exists on paper, but lacks any truly identifiable culture or people that unmistakably separates it from the rest of the western world. As nationalism is currently gaining strength throughout the world, how will this affect Canada? Will it lead to our country gaining some sort of identity of its own? Or will it lead to a splintering as regional identities take precedence? What will be the result of Canada's status of ‘first post-national state’ as the world goes through what will most likely be a major geopolitical shake-up in the coming decades?"

We Initially started out with a very intense relationship that he very quickly ended which ended in disillusionment, anxiety, and a pregnancy scare.

As America celebrated Independence Day, the Internet exploded following allegations that CNN threatened and coerced the Reddit user behind the popular Donald Trump/CNN Wrestling meme into silence for exercising his first amendment rights. In an article by CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski, it is detailed how Reddit user HanA**holeSolo “apologized for calls for violence against the press,” took down all his social media posts, begged for his identity not to be released an promised he wouldn’t engage in any similar behavior. The article noted that CNN agreed not to release his name, but “reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.”

On July 4th, 1776, the Continental Congress declared that the thirteen American colonies now regarded themselves as a new nation, the United States of America, and were no longer part of the British Empire. As Americans celebrate Independence Day with cookouts, fireworks and friendly gatherings, Stefan Molyneux aims to remind them as to the cost of their freedom.

After President Donald Trump shared a meme of him tackling and thrashing a CNN corporate logo - the mainstream media have absolutely lost their minds. Given the excuses made by the fake news media for the political violence directed towards Trump and his supporters - the pearl clutching is as hypocritical as it is precious. 

President Donald J. Trump on Twitter: “The FAKE & FRAUDULENT NEWS MEDIA is working hard to convince Republicans and others I should not use social media - but remember, I won the 2016 election with interviews, speeches and social media. I had to beat #FakeNews, and did. We will continue to WIN! … My use of social media is not Presidential - it’s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL. Make America Great Again!”

"The Strange Death of Europe is a highly personal account of a continent and culture caught in the act of suicide. Declining birth rates, mass immigration, and cultivated self-distrust and self-hatred have come together to make Europeans unable to argue for themselves and incapable of resisting their own comprehensive alteration as a society and an eventual end."

"This is not just an analysis of demographic and political realities, it is also an eyewitness account of a continent in self-destruct mode. It includes accounts based on travels across the entire continent, from the places where migrants land to the places they end up, from the people who pretend they want them to the places which cannot accept them."

Douglas Murray is Associate Editor of the Spectator and the Associate Director of the Henry Jackson Society. His is the author of many books including “Bloody Sunday: Truths, Lies and the Saville Inquiry” and “The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam.”

After the New York Times issued a retraction to the often repeated claim that 17 U.S. Intelligence agencies claim that the Russian government "Hacked The Election" - the Russia narrative is dead. 

New York Times Retraction: "A White House Memo article on Monday about President Trump's deflections and denials about Russia referred incorrectly to the source of an intelligence assessment that said Russia orchestrated hacking attacks during last year's presidential election. The assessment was made by four intelligence agencies — the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. The assessment was not approved by all 17 organizations in the American intelligence community."

Project Veritas and James O’Keefe have recently published undercover video exposing CNN’s coverage of the “Russia Hacked The Election” narrative to be dishonest, biased and motivated by a desire to attract ratings. James O’Keefe joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss the importance of exposing fake news, media unwillingness to issue legitimate retractions, why the non-stop use of anonymous sources is illegitimate, the role postmodernism plays in modern journalism, the left’s false monopoly on virtue and what is coming next from Project Veritas. 

James O’Keefe is an award-winning journalist and the founder and President of both Project Veritas and Project Veritas Action, non-profit organizations dedicated to investigating corruption, dishonesty, waste and fraud in both public and private institutions.

Now with James O’Keefe and Project Veritas publishing another undercover video with a CNN Producer acknowledging that the Trump/Russia collusion narrative is nonsense used to drive television ratings – nobody should ever take them seriously again.

On September 11th, 1973, Augusto Pinochet assumed power in Chile by overthrowing the democratically elected socialist government of President Salvador Allende – starting his controversial 17-years of rule. While many leftists point to the clear human rights abuses which occurred under Pinochet, they often omit the equally relevant backstory, the Chilean economic miracle, and the surprising willingness of Pinochet to give up power and transition the country back to democracy. What is the untold story of Augusto Pinochet?

Question: “An old friend of mine has been on a self-destructive path for the better part of a decade, with no signs of stopping. While I have no longer have any desire to help her out of her hole, I do think I have an obligation to and have acted upon a perceived obligation to help my other friend deal with the problem, which more or less makes me an accessory to an intervention. Do you think there is any way to avoid being dragged into the main conflict by choosing this route, or will I inevitably be sucked into the gravity well? By extension, do you think that there is any merit in my friend attempting to intervene at all?”

An estimated 1.5 million Armenian people were extinguished by the Turkish government ruling the Ottoman Empire in a centrally planned and administered slaughter known as the Armenian Genocide. Under the cloud of World War I, between 1915 and 1918, the mostly Christian Armenian population were subjected to deportation, expropriation, abduction, torture, massacre, and starvation as they were forcibly removed from Armenia and Anatolia to Syria and marched through the desert to die. 

Following the end of World War I, the atrocities resumed between 1920 and 1923, and the remaining Armenian population was subjected to further violence, slaughter and expulsion. In 1915, thirty-three years before UN Genocide Convention was adopted, the Armenian Genocide was condemned by the international community as a crime against humanity.

Dr. Rouben Adalian is the Director of the Armenian National Institute and a specialist on the Caucasus and the Middle East. In 1993, Dr. Adalian completed a project to document the Armenian Genocide in the United States National Archives.

Question: “As a manager in a global Financial Services business that employees over 200k people and has revenues of over $29bn US Dollars, I have seen a huge focus develop on ‘Gender Equality’, meaning that there are a number of initiatives and programs aimed at getting more women into senior positions in the firm, where they are statistically under represented. Do you think that such initiatives are valuable and, if so, what role can / should men play in supporting them? I ask as I while I am very ‘pro-equality’, through my work with the Women’s Network, I have increasingly heard phrases like “white men just don’t get it” and ‘there are too many pale, male and stale decision makers’ which makes me ask – is there an enormous double standard developing?”

Question: “Why should I spend my life trying to do any good, even if we can recognize a simply material-mutualistic benefit to it? When people are so clearly insane they can't recognize great threats to society and their own lives and livelihoods, can't see evil staring them in the face, and you get no rapport but either perplexity or hostility thrown back in your teeth when you dare to mention it, and it would be easy enough to abuse their folly... What more fundamental reason then to try to do good to one and all rather than exploit the wankers and leave them by the side of the road?"

Question: “I work for the largest employer in a western state with an employee base of over 40,000 people. Recently, the entire web development department was told that they will be losing their jobs within the next two weeks and being replaced by a consultant company. The employees who are losing their jobs are being forced to participate in ‘knowledge transfer’ meetings each day with their replacements of this consultant company, most of which are offshore in India. This is a growing trend among companies with large IT staffs as developers, architects, database admins and analysts are expensive components of the payroll. With Trump's focus on keeping American jobs in America, why is there little or no coverage of the intellectual exodus of technical positions offshore?”

Question: “When I watched the video you posted titled 'why democracy always fails', I nearly lost faith in you! I think I can demonstrate to you that what you think is democracy is not a democracy at all, but an elected oligarchy disguised as one. A genuine democracy would function very differently. Not only can I demonstrate that; I can present a relatively simple fix to change our elected oligarchy into a democracy that will transfer power out of the hands of political parties and into the hands of voters, where it should be.”

Title: Rep. Steve Scalise Shot By Radicalized Leftist, Anti-Trump Violence Continues
Date: 2017-06-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PLYJnEM-xdQ
Description: Early this morning, a 66 year old shot at U.S. Republican members of Congress. The politicians were practicing for a baseball game when the shooter asked someone if it was Republicans or Democrats playing – when he was told they were Republicans, he took up position and started shooting them.

Representative Steve Scalise was shot in the hip, and is currently undergoing surgery for his wound. The death toll would likely have been far higher, except for the fact that Scalise is the Republican House Majority Whip, and so had a permanent security detail with him. At least four individuals were shot by the assailant: Scalise, two police officers, and a congressional staffer.

Representative Mark Walker (R-NC) told a reporter the shooter “was there to kill as many Republican members as possible.”

Naturally, the left in general is going to focus on gun control, the race and gender of the shooter, his murderous spree as a “tragic expression of a legitimate grievance” and so on.

Don’t let them.

On June 11th, 2017, Puerto Rico held a non-binding referendum on whether to become an actual state or stay an American territory. 

While 97% of those who participated in the referendum vote favored statehood, only 23% of the territory's population participated in the process. It was the lowest level of participation in any election in Puerto Rico since 1967.

U.S. Congress makes the sole determination regarding any changes to Puerto Rico's political status. Puerto Rico is currently seeking the bankruptcy protections that statehood would likely provide – with $74 billion in debt and $49 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.

Question: “The first time I ever listened to your podcast, and many times since, you've shut down a caller when they use the phrase: ‘I feel that...’ by telling them how that isn't an argument. You're right, of course, feelings aren't arguments. However, my limited knowledge of psychology is that the unconscious mind is doing a lot of work in the background crunching through data at a much higher speed than the conscious mind is able to. And, when the unconscious arrives at a conclusion, this may be presented as a feeling or an intuition. This could be an experienced electrician who can just point at a wall and know that the problem is behind it, or a football quarterback that knows he has to throw the ball right now. I've always pictured your unconscious as a savant who is hogtied and gagged in the trunk of your car and his only way of getting a message to you is to bump his head on the back of the seats.”

Question: “I had a really great childhood, and I think I've made it to adulthood pretty successfully. I am happily married to a wonderful man and have extremely high hopes for our future. However, in the first months of my marriage, I was so frustrated during an argument with my husband that I scratched his face and left a mark. I haven't done it again, but I don't ever want a repeat. Can you help me uncover where this propensity for violence is coming from, before we bring children into this house?”

Book Summary: “Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, in an attempt to defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.”

Vox Day is a multiple-time Hugo Award nominee who writes epic fantasy as well as non-fiction including “SJWs Always Lie: Taking Down the Thought Police” and “Cuckservative: How "Conservatives" Betrayed America.”

Question: “I was very disappointed to hear your hard stance on illegal immigrants, generalizing them as dishonest moochers on tax-payers dollars who shouldn't be given sanctuary or the chance to naturalize, work, receive an education or benefit from government assistance. Most illegal immigrants are from impoverished, war-torn, dangerous countries simply seeking better lives for their families but are rejected because they lack the education or the financial means. Immigrants - legal or otherwise - contribute greatly to the economies of countries receiving them, working the fields and farm lands locals refuse to work, understanding the value of education and social services in ways many first world locals do not. If, hypothetically, Canada became war torn, dangerous and access to essential resources were difficult, Stefan wouldn't you do everything necessary to get your wife and daughter to a country of safety even if that meant illegal means if other options weren't available?”

Women are great warriors. 3. the hot Amazon supermodel librarian. 4. The incomprehensibly jealous and angry villain.

On June 3rd, 2017, London Metropolitan Police responded to reports of a white van mounting the pavement and plowing through a crowd of pedestrians on London Bridge. The van then continued from London Bridge to nearby Borough Market where three terrorists exited the vehicle and began stabbing civilians with what were described “12-inch butcher knives.”

The three attackers were shot and killed by police within eight minutes of the first call, seven innocent people died at the scene of the attack and another 48 injured were taken to five different hospitals. With the recent attacks in Westminster and Manchester, this incident marked the third major United Kingdom terrorist attack in less than three months.

While CNN has refused to disavow their special host, anybody not infected with a terminal case of Trump Derangement Syndrome was appalled by Griffin’s behavior. If the regressive left will not listen to reason – then social and economic ostracism is all that stands between us and a continued escalation of violence.

Question: “I'm a 29-year-old woman, single, no kids, and a homeowner. I have done 10 years of therapy and have not been successful at attracting mentally healthy friends or men, which has lead me to live a relatively isolated life. When I listen to your work and the work of other conservative thinkers, I am afraid that I will be miserable living a life alone. I am also keenly aware of my age in terms of attracting a mate. Do you think a woman can live a fulfilling life without a family? And, if so, what advice would you have to create that life?”

As I ponder fatherhood, I get so scared that my kids might feel the same darkness and loneliness I felt when I grew up. I’m afraid that because I haven't really addressed the pain of my childhood, that history will repeat itself and I’ll be like my father and my kids will cry as I did. What can I do, to make sure that if my kids feel pain, it’s not cause their father? How do I break the chains of bitterness so that it doesn't affect my children? How can I keep my emotional baggage from affecting my children's development?”"

On February 14th, 2017, President Donald Trump had a meeting with then FBI Director James Comey at the White House in the Oval office. At the time, The New York Times described the meeting as taking “place just a day after Mr. Flynn was forced out of his job after it was revealed he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of phone conversations he had had with the Russian ambassador to the United States.”

The New York Times on May 16th, 2017: “President Trump asked the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to shut down the federal investigation into Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in an Oval Office meeting in February, according to a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the meeting.”

What is the Truth About The James Comey Memo? Was President Donald Trump obstructing justice or is this just another mainstream media smear campaign?

Less than 24 hours after Private Investigator Rod Wheeler claimed that “investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” the story has changed. Wheeler is now claiming that he had no additional evidence to suggest that Seth Rich contacted WikiLeaks prior to his murder.

On July 10th, 2016, Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Rich was shot twice and killed near his home in Northwest Washington’s Bloomingdale neighborhood. In August 2016, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange strongly implied that Seth Rich was the source of the Democratic National Committee email leak. Recent reports by Private Investigator Rod Wheeler and Fox News have reignited significant interest in the Seth Rich investigation.

The mere mention of South Africa in a discussion provokes deep images of institutional racism, discrimination and horrific violence. Stefan Molyneux is joined by Simon Roche for an in-depth look at the controversial history of South Africa, the untold story of Apartheid, rising criminality, an astronomical murder rate, President Jacob Zuma's reign of terror, the epidemic slaughter of white farmers, Afrikaner boer land confiscation and the growing possibility of civil war. 

Simon Roche is Head of the Office of the HQ of the world’s largest non-state civil defense organization, Suidlanders of South Africa. Once an ANC activist, Simon Roche now works with Suidlanders to prepare for impending catastrophe in the Rainbow Nation.

I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.”

“While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgement of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.

Approximately nine gigabytes of data from French Presidential Candidate Emmanuel Macron's campaign and various associates was posted online by an anonymous user. While Macron disputes the legitimacy of some of the materials, this follows the trend we've seen with emails released by Wikileaks from the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, combined with the incredible detective work by 4chan's /pol/ related to masked Antifa criminals. The investigative journalism responsibilities of the pro-globalist mainstream media are being done by many independent sources and the impact is far reaching.

We are confronted with a jarring reality that the Left has succeeded in growing the power of the courts. President Barack Obama was successful in replacing roughly 30 percent of the district and appellate judges on the federal benches. The United States of America is now facing an unprecedented judicial time bomb, the likes of which the country has never previously witnessed. Daniel Horowitz joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss rising judicial activism in the United States, how President Donald Trump has been thwarted by unelected judges and what can be done to restore sovereignty from the tyrannical court system. 

Daniel Horowitz is Senior Editor at Conservative Review and the author of “Stolen Sovereignty: How to Stop Unelected Judges from Transforming America.”

The New York Times recently published an “opinion piece” from radical feminist Vivian Gornick where she spoke glowingly of communism, describing it as “inspirational” ideology despite it being responsible for the deaths of 100,000,000+ people. Why does the mainstream media continually publish vapid articles like “When Communism Inspired Americans” which only serve to whitewash the bloody history of a murderous ideology?

Question: “I am in a relationship with an incredible woman. She is beautiful, intelligent, virtuous, fun and passionate. She embraces her femininity and respects my masculinity. She supports me in all my endeavors, and relishes being a perfect homemaker. The only problem is that she wants to get married and have children. As soon as I realized that this desire wouldn't go away, I told her that she must proceed with our relationship knowing that those things will never happen. It was very hard for her to accept, but she stayed. The only thing she asked in return was that I keep an open mind."

"It's been about a year since that conversation, and my opinion regarding children hasn't changed yet I feel her maternal instinct intensifying. It increasingly manifests itself in conversations and daily affairs, and sometimes I can't help but seriously consider letting her go. She's young, but nevertheless she is still on the clock. I love her enough to not deprive her of what I can now see is her greatest value, which is being a mother one day. How can I clear my thinking so I can make the right decision?”

Question: “Given that energy cannot be created or destroyed, does it not make sense that our essence or soul continues after physical death, and can reincarnate to continue the necessary learning process to advance our understanding of the universe and what might be outside of it? In short: Do you believe in reincarnation? And, would you please elaborate on why you do or do not?”

Question: “I'm a young guy in my twenties and am currently developing a real estate project in South America. It's my first development and has been a hell of a ride thus far but now we're entering a phase of the project where I find myself having to push my limits even more than before. The time has come for a serious marketing and sales push and even though I enjoy it overall, I think I might be getting in my own way. 

"I'm a mellow, polite, Canadian so the pushy salesman thing doesn't come naturally to me. So far, we've been able to employ a more relaxed and organic approach but it's crunch time and I think I have to grow beyond my comfort zone again. As an experienced entrepreneur, how did you get results in this area without becoming pushy or dishonest? I value my credibility and reputation as an honest and genuine person so I would hate to become "that guy" that's probably just trying to sell you something.”

Question: “I am a 27-year-old quadriplegic man living in the States. My question is how can I move forward in life with the restrictions I have and other elements like government, that tend to push one's life back into the hole that one has almost appeared from? I am very fearful of moving forward, for me to just fail or worst fall. How can I move pass this fear in a direction that would most likely give me the chance for success and what could be causing this fear?”

Question: “Over the past, it's obvious there has been a co-opting, distortion and abuse of what we call mysticism or religion, both in its exoteric forms (i.e. Christianity, Islam, Judaism) and in its somewhat more esoteric traditions (i.e. Yoga traditions, Buddhism, psychedelics, shamanism, Kabbalah, etc). If we denounce mysticism altogether because of its recent co-opting and inversion by largely nefarious, anti-individual forces, would that perhaps be like a woman denouncing all men because of prior bad relationships or a poor father figure or because Stalin was a man? Do you think that reason/rational and mysticism/irrational need and complete each other? Wouldn't reason without mysticism be like masturbating vs making love? With reason alone, you might get a few thrills, but ultimately, wouldn't you die alone with your dick in your hand?”

Question: “My family illegally emigrated from Mexico to the United States when I was 6 years old. At the age of 21 I decided to come back to my home country, ignorant as I was of its culture, after concluding I would rather be free in my third world country than live a life of shame and illegality in someone else’s. It has taken me nearly ten years to accept and start to understand the shock and far reaching consequences this transition had on my life and spirit."

"Far from integrating into this new culture, I recoiled from it and tried to maintain my American mindset and ideals... The issue I’m struggling with now is my newfound sympathy towards nationalist ideas, and the tricky position it puts me in. I identify as neither American nor Mexican, but the hard fact of my citizenship leads me to conclude that I should fight in the interests of my homeland against the corruption of its leaders and the larger globalist agenda.”

The possibility of a United States led conflict with North Korea has put a spotlight on the shocking history of the “Great Leader” Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong-un and the DPRK: Democratic People's Republic of Korea. With hundreds of thousands estimated to be held in concentration camps, rampant starvation, endless threats of violence and cradle to grave propaganda, the North Korean people are living the equivalent of hell on earth.

The Syrian Democratic Forces fighting President Bashar al-Assad requested air support from the U.S.-led coalition to bomb Islamic State Forces in Northern Syria. They gave the wrong coordinates.

On April 7th, 2017, Central Stockholm in Sweden saw a bloody terrorist attack at the hands of a 39-year-old from Uzbekistan. Stockholm truck attacker Rakhmat Akilov hijacked a truck and drove into a crowded area killing four people and injuring 15 others. The Swedish newspaper “Aftonbladet” reported that Akilov said he was “pleased with what he had done. … I mowed down the infidels… The bombings in Syria have to end.”

Akilov was a construction worker who originally applied for asylum in Sweden in 2014, but was refused permanent residency in June 2016. Swedish police attempted to deport the Akilov in February 2017 but found he was not at his registered address.

Description: White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has found himself under fire for comments made during an April 11th, 2017 press briefing: “You look -- we didn't use chemical weapons in World War II. You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn't even sink to using chemical weapons. So you have to, if you're Russia, ask yourself is this a country that you and a regime that you want to align yourself with? You have previously signed on to international agreements rightfully acknowledging that the use of chemical weapons should be out of bounds by every country. To not stand up to not only Assad, but your own word, should be troubling.”

This week there is only one story to talk about – the Syria Chemical Attack and President Donald Trump’s military response on the 100th anniversary of the United States entry into World War I. Infuriating many of his supporters who oppose foreign wars and nation building, President Trump’s decision to launch 50+ Tomahawk cruise missiles into Syria has sparked a significant debate across the nation. Will the United States aim to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and add Syria to the list of failed nation-building military interventions? Only time will tell.

Did Barack Obama spy on President Donald Trump, his political campaign and his transition team? A recent bombshell report by Mike Cernovich confirms former National Security Adviser Susan Rice to be responsible for the intelligence "unmasking" of Trump officials. Will there be any legal accountability for this unethical banana republic style behavior?

“We started delving into your work. When covering your arguments regarding Atheism, we found issues with parts of your logic. We have built an argument which we hope clearly establishes a framework which highlights a distinction between ‘that which we can relate to’ and ‘that which is unrelatable.’ In the light of this distinction, the contradictions of your arguments are manifest. Below you will find our argument, your arguments, our understanding of your argument, and a succinct articulation of the contradiction. We are very interested to start a dialogue in the hopes of contributing to the general progression of philosophy as a whole.” 

“Relation vs Non-Relation Argument : 1) Truth is derived from necessity. 2) Necessity is coherent. 3) Coherence is meaning. 4) Meaning is knowledge. 5) We can know something to be true if and only if it is necessarily true. 6) Humans relate to that which is discrete. 7) Humans faculties can directly process and derive meaning from that which is discrete. 8) Humans have direct access to true knowledge about that which they can relate utilizing their faculties. 9) That which is not discrete, humans can not relate. 10) Truth is not contingent upon relatability. 11) Humans can abstract about that which they cannot relate. 12) Humans have indirect access to true knowledge about that which they cannot relate utilizing necessary truths about abstractions.”

Question: “I’ve been called racist 3 times within the last year. As a black guy, this is very strange because it’s technically against the liberal rules. However, I have started to see myself become increasingly xenophobic for lack of a better word. This is what I want for an immigration plan: Immediate expulsion of illegal immigrants, end of birthright citizenship, revocation of citizenship to those born to illegal parents, change of immigration to Japanese system, and an oath of allegiance to receive right to vote and government benefits.” 

“I feel like at worst, the immigrants want to annihilate us and at best they want to change our culture by coming here and changing our lives slowly. Someone asked me what composition I would like for the United States to be and I immediately answered ‘80% white, 20% black and make space for 1% other.’ Have I gone too far? Has moving to Texas made me ….?”

In Disney's remake of the classic tale Beauty and the Beast, Emma Watson plays Belle, a "bright, beautiful and independent young woman, is taken prisoner by a beast in its castle." Is Beauty and the Beast filled with the anti-male female vanity stoking tropes that has become commonplace in modern Disney films? What is the truth about Emma Watson's rendition of Beauty and the Beast - is it a fun children's story, or vile and dangerous propaganda?

The history of left-wing violence, forced labor camps and mass murder is often obscured by traditional media and modern academia. The body-count left in the wake of Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong illustrated the dangers of communism, socialism and totalitarian leftist ideology overall. Mike Cernovich joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago and the important historical lessons which much be learned to prevent the spread of violence in modern times. 

Mike Cernovich is a lawyer, filmmaker and the bestselling author of “Gorilla Mindset: How to Control Your Thoughts and Emotions to Live Life on Your Terms” and “MAGA Mindset: How to Make You and America Great Again.” Cernovich is also the producer of the film documentary “Silenced.

Question: “With all the race bating rhetoric the media uses to reinforce white guilt and the over criminalization of blacks, which further divides us. How can we make race relationships better when people are scared to speak their minds without feeling guilty for it?”

Peter Schiff joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss the state of the United States economy, the nature of the U.S. debt ceiling limit, why Paul Ryan's Obamacare replacement won't work, how to solve the American health care crisis and why many are salivating at the opportunity to blame President Trump for long existing economic problems.

Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3621-shakespeares-king-lear-revealed-duke-pesta-and-stefan-molyneux

One of the most powerful stories in the world, King Lear magnificently describes the destruction of a kingdom through greed, vanity, manipulation - and a bottomless thirst for political power. William Shakespeare is the undisputed master of describing intergenerational conflicts, but many other themes run through this magnificent story. Join Stefan Molyneux - a former Shakespearean actor - and Dr. Duke Pesta, a tenured professor of literature, as they discuss the deep meaning and existential themes buried in one of the greatest tragedies ever penned.

Title: Rachel Maddow Reports Donald Trump Paid Taxes | True News
Date: 2017-03-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=fEwUGhJr3eY
Description: On March 14th at 8:36pm, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow tweeted: “BREAKING: We've got Trump tax returns. Tonight, 9pm ET. MSNBC. (Seriously). … What we've got is from 2005... the President's 1040 form... details to come tonight 9PM ET, MSNBC.”

White House Statement: “You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago. Before being elected President, Mr. Trump was one of the most successful businessmen in the world with a responsibility to his company, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required.”

“That being said, Mr. Trump paid $38 million dollars even after taking into account large scale depreciation for construction, on an income of more than $150 million dollars, as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that.”

“Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns. The dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the President will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.”

On April 16th, 2017, Turkey will hold a referendum on “constitutional changes” which would grant Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan additional authority. The Netherlands and many European countries have significant Turkish populations who are eligible to vote in the referendum and Erdogan’s design to campaign in those countries has led to a significant diplomatic crisis. 

After Turkish riots overtook Dutch streets, the Netherlands government has withdrawn permission for Turkish officials to campaign in the country, citing “risks to public order and security.” Erdogan has threatened harsh sanctions and even alluded to war over these measures – all mere days away from the Netherlands own parliamentary election.

On March 4th, 2016, President Donald Trump published a series of tweets alleging that former President Barack Obama and his administration spied on him during his presidential campaign. President Barack Obama's carefully worded statement to President Trump's accusations have only added fuel to the political fire engulfing the highest office in the United States.

“Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my “wires tapped” in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! … Is it legal for a sitting President to be 'wire tapping' a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW! … I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election! … How low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!”

In light of rising political tensions, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch claimed that “our rights” are “being assailed, being trampled on and even being rolled back.” Lynch didn't elaborate what rights were apparently being rolled back, but did make a desperate plea seemingly calling for leftists to band together, march in the streets and engage in political violence to achieve their political goals. 

Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch: “I know that this is a time of great fear and uncertainty for so many people. I know it’s a time of concern for people, who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on and even being rolled back. I know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our Founding Fathers. ... It has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals who have made the difference. They’ve marched, they’ve bled and yes, some of them died. This is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before. We can do this again.”

With the French Presidential election upcoming, the topic of Immigration and the impact of the European Migrant Crisis remains an incredibly important campaign issue. 

On July 17th, 2016, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls made a startling claim: "Terrorism will be a part of our daily lives for a long time. Let's be clear: Times have changed.“ Is terrorism, violence and economic migration something the French people will truly accept as the new normal?

On April 23rd, 2017, France will hold their Presidential election featuring National Front leader Marine Le Pen, Independent Candidate Emmanuel Macron, the Socialist Party’s Benoit Hamon, Left Party’s Jean-Luc Melenchon and Conservative candidate Francois Fillon. What future will the French people choose?

Question: “Most Latinos escape to the USA from their homeland for a better life but instead of assimilating and adopting the American Spirit, they stay in their Latino communities and recreate their countries conditions in the USA. Look at the marches in the last couple of days--they are carrying their countries flags?! If immigrants escape the hardships in their homeland, why do they -when they are in the U.S.- crave to be back in their homeland and do not adopt the U.S. spirit of self-reliance and ingenuity?”

Question: “I am a 21-year-old university student. I have a girlfriend of about 6 months. When I first met her, I was committed to having as much casual sex with as many different girls as possible. I still feel a strong compulsion to do this, despite the moral doubt I have about it since following your show."

"Upon meeting this girl, it became apparent that she was amazing and a candidate for marriage. So I dropped my decadent approach to sex and I am now 6 months in to a monogamous relationship. I still have a drive to be single and have sex with as many girls as possible."

"I feel like a liar and deceiver because everyday I assure her of my commitment to her and that I plan to marry her, but I am not sure. I lie about my feelings. I took her virginity and assured her of long-term commitment when I wasn't sure about it. I really wanted to take a virginity to appease my ego."

"I feel terrible about it. I feel like I am the problem. I am the one contributing to the moral decay in romantic relationships in the West. I am the creator of women who create MGTOW guys.”

Milo Yiannopoulos stood tall for free speech, and against the puritanical language fascism of political correctness. As a good-looking, ridiculously articulate gay man, he could have found a comfortable place to nestle in leftist cliches, and would have been welcomed by the establishment with open arms. Instead, he turned his considerable charm, talents, humor and intellect on the enemies of free thought and free speech - helping to provoke and reveal the violence and hatefulness of dangerous and powerful elements within Western society.

And now, he stands on a precipice, which we really need to examine in detail.

In the span of 48 hours, Milo Yiannopoulos has fallen from grace in the eyes of many. He has lost his quarter million dollar book deal, he has resigned from his influential position at Breitbart, and been disinvited from his prestigious speaking engagement at CPAC.

The political correctness police has recently attacked YouTube sensation PewDiePie for making "inappropriate jokes" in several of his recent videos. Stefan Molyneux contrasts the failures of the older generation with their finger-wagging virtue-signaling moralizing - and highlights why they lack credibility with young people.

Question: “I've spent the majority of my adult life devoted to my career, considering myself a 'fiercely independent' feminist and not allowing men to have much control in a relationship. However, a few years ago I started dating someone who didn't accept this behavior and I found myself slowly taking on a traditional girlfriend role, now as a wife and mother. Things have gone really well between us and I'm happy, but still find myself missing my old life. I've heard you talk an awful lot about how women are wired to want men to provide resources while they take care of the young, but I don't feel it's coming natural to me. Am I broken? What can I do to ensure that I don't fall into old patterns? Do you think there's enough space for a woman to balance being a great wife and mom, yet also continue to stay in charge of her career without sacrificing family?”

Question: “I have a few questions concerning addiction. I am a recovering heroin addict who is having a hard time dealing with the compulsion to use again. I was curious to your stance on 12 steps programs, one of which I attend regularly. Do you think these programs are less beneficial than they seem? Does it hinder my recovery to get into a mindset that I cannot recover without the program? Furthermore, why do you think that young people are using hard drugs, and drugs in general, in higher numbers than any other time in history? Is it because of the ease of access of substances, the coddling of my generation, or a combination of both?”

No Campus for White Men shines a bright light on the growing obsession with diversity, victimization and identity politics on today's college campuses, and shows how it is creating an intensely hostile and fearful atmosphere that can only lead, ultimately, to ever greater polarization in American society.

Civilization is a conversation, and moral progress is always the most shocking part of that conversation. Every great moral advance in human history has been met with shocked revulsion by significant existing power groups.

The great abolitionist Wilberforce spend more than three decades making the case for ending slavery, before the British Parliament finally voted to outlaw the hideous practice on the third of the globe ruled by Great Britain. John Milton wrote his passionate defense of free speech in 1644 – freedom of the press was not achieved in England until 1695, more than half a century later.

Equal rights for women and minorities, freedom of trade, separation of church and state, the right to divorce – each of these advances was considered an appalling break with virtuous traditions – and they all have one thing in common. One thing. In the absence of free speech, these advances would never have occurred.

Question: “Why do you not take a more active stance in telling your listeners about the effectiveness of the virtues of patience and tolerance when conducting a debate with people? This is important because in todays society we encounter people who argue based on feelings and propaganda but why should we take what they say so personal? In my own experience, remaining calm when for example being called a racist and staying with my argument or maybe presenting it in a different way is more effective for actually changing people’s minds than correcting their morality. I know that you have no responsibility over your audiences decisions but I think it would be smart to show them a more effective way of getting the message of reason and truth across.”

Many are still hopeful for a change, but I don't see it happening any time soon because of the level of entrenchment of the regime against an ineffectual opposition. Additionally, most people don't even care to understand why we reached this sorry state. Do you really think the creative, intelligent Venezuelans should remain here to waste their lives?”

Question: "My girlfriend of 8 months recently left me. I since have felt confused and anxious. It seems to affect me more than I see it affect others. I feel spite for the woman I loved and have ill will towards her. This is a recurring theme throughout my past relationships. Why? Why is it so difficult for me to do the grown up thing and hope my ex does well and is happy?”

Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3585-hamlet-revealed-the-truth-behind-shakespeares-greatest-play

Hamlet is the greatest play in world literature – listen to a trained actor and Professor of Shakespeare talk in depth about what the play means, why its power endures, and what it reveals about the deepest parts of each of us. The glory of this tragedy is how it wakes us up to death, reminds us of the power - and danger - of passion, and brings to life the potential and paralysis of our own thoughts. 

Philosophy, nihilism, god, heaven, hell, revenge, love and life and death – Hamlet has it all! Dr. Duke Pesta, tenured professor, and Stefan Molyneux, trained actor, delve deep into the themes and meanings of the greatest secular story ever told.

Dr. Duke Pesta is a tenured university professor, author and the Academic Director of FreedomProject Academy, a Live Online School offering individual classes and complete curricula for students in Kindergarten through High School.

Why is skepticism important? What methodology do you use to determine the difference between truth and falsehood? Dr. Michael Shermer joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss the nature of human belief, removing the intensity from the climate change discussion, the disembowelment of religion without constructing a new system of ethics, replacing god with large government, delaying gratification, the importance of impulse control, ending poverty worldwide, why determinism fails and much much more!

Dr. Michael Shermer is the Founding Publisher of Skeptic magazine, a monthly columnist for Scientific American and Presidential Fellow at Chapman University. He is the author of many popular books, including his most recent “Skeptic: Viewing the World with a Rational Eye.”

I watch Hollywood awards ceremonies where a supposed artist screams out for punching people in the face for political disagreements, and the entire horde of Botoxed brain zombies leaps to their feet in an ungodly and unholy howl of rampant bloodlust approval.

There is a storm coming, it is being summoned by the words of the vicious and ignorant, of the hateful and horrifying – it is a time-storm, it will throw us back through history – and that is if we are lucky. If we are unlucky, it will throw us back through history to prehistory, perhaps even to the history before we were here as a species.

This is the storm.

The mainstream media spent the weekend lying about President Donald Trump instituting a Muslim ban, lying about the contents of the recent executive order, lying about those impacted by the new guidelines and lying about why seven specific countries were included in the travel restrictions.

President Trump was painted as a monster for placing a temporary ban on accepting Syrian refugees - while other world leaders bent over backwards to virtue signal and express their willingness to destabilize their countries.

While the mainstream media, politicians, corporations and Hollywood celebrities were virtue signaling - President Trump made a few phone calls and may have just saved Western Civilization.

President Donald Trump’s recent immigration related executive orders temporarily ban visitors from Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Libya, and Sudan from entering the United States without “extreme vetting” and stop the intake refugees from these countries for at least 30 days. Is this a "Muslim Ban" as is being reported - or is the mainstream media lying to you once again?

Newspapers worldwide are failing in spectacular fashion.

Yes, really!

Buried in the sordid and socialized mess of the Women’s March is an essential truth that is worth evaluating and understanding. It is a cliché that feminists are physically unattractive, but there is solid science and research behind it. 

One study of American women indicated that women generally pursue careers because they fear they are too unattractive to land a man. In another study, the more attractive a woman thought she was, the less feminist she was. Whenever there is a clear pattern that is almost never discussed, it is worth pursuing to the end.

With the Inauguration of President Donald Trump, leftists have taken to the street, not in peaceful protest, but with violent confrontations and riots. Property damage, physical assaults, shootings, and more have all been done in the name of “the high road” and “love trumping hate.” Stefan Molyneux is pissed off and wants to discuss his now complicated relationship with hatred.

Question: “I was wondering if you have any advice for the millennials who have been screwed by excessive student loan debt and a tough job market. I accept full responsibility for the fact that I went to college at 18 (on a full academic scholarship) and chose basket-weaving majors that I found interesting, history and film, which amounted to nothing for me."

"I tried teaching, and had to go through another crushing debt cycle to do that, only to find out that I would rather dig ditches than be a high school teacher. For those of us feeling left out of the economy of good jobs, do you have any advice on how to get out of a crappy cycle of entry level job hell, feelings of failure, and find something both profitable and meaningful?”

I had to listen to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I have a dream” speech when I was in government schools – repeatedly, every year, it seemed. Unfortunately, I was already reading real philosophy, so I immediately pegged it for the dangerous sophistry that it was, and remains.

I know, I know, it is considered one of the crowning achievements of American oratory – but now, so many decades later, aiming at a dream seems to have landed us all in a nightmare, and perhaps we should take a little bit of time to figure out what the hell went so wrong. Here’s the first clue: Dr. King’s speech is called “I have a dream,” not “I have a plan.”

The mainstream narrative would tell you that from 1950 to 1954, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy unjustly accused a wide variety of Americans of being communist spies, creating a hysterical witch-hunt that destroyed the lives of innocent people. What is the truth about Sen. Joseph McCarthy and McCarthyism? What are the modern parallels between mid-1950s McCarthyism and the events of today?

On Tuesday, Buzzfeed published an "article" titled "These Reports Allege Trump Has Deep Ties To Russia" which included a completely unsubstantiated and error filled document supposedly from a former British Intelligence officer. When it comes to modern "journalism" this publication drops standards to a new low - even for an outlet like Buzzfeed.

Question: “It is my assessment that the left has destroyed at the very least the nuclear family and consequently gender roles by creating a nanny state. However, it seems that my dear group, the atheists have destroyed any sense of community that extends beyond family and are pushing a sort of hedonistic anarchy. It seems more and more that we need something but being an atheist, the idea of going back is akin to being asked to believe in Santa Claus again. What can we (as atheists) use as a long-term supplement?”

Question: “During my final school years, my Literature teacher told me that I was full of potential, which I was not using. At that time I disregarded the comment, since I had little interest in wasting more time on school than necessary. Now, years later, I have finished my university abroad and took a year break, using welfare from the unemployment fund."

"Two months into it, I realized that I am nothing else but a NEET, something I never aspired to be. Moreover, the time off I intended to spend self-studying and developing, is spent procrastinating."

"Even though I really want to, I rarely feel compelled to do anything. Sometimes, I can’t even force myself out of bed, but I am not depressed, I am alarmingly content. All of that made me reflect on the teachers remark and question my decision. How does one know and fulfill his potential?”

"And, of course, the Western nations will pay for the support of all these immigrants, many of whom are illiterate, have few if any employable skills, are ignorant of law and order, and bring with them totalitarian ideologies. Could you discuss this redistribution of the global population as it relates to our Western values of self-determination and individual liberties?”

"I am an evil demon, I mean straight white Trump voting man currently living in Chicago. As a student, comedian, entrepreneur and child care worker I've had nearly the full range of experiences the liberal haven has to offer, dealing with the DePaul Milo riot, watching my pro Trump comedian friend get banned from comedy shows and bullied, I've been paid under minimum wage to watch abused children with employers who refuse to do anything to help the kids. My girlfriend's brother and our friend have been mugged just outside where we live, and our college tries to push the social justice agenda frequently. I've had more negative experiences with this city than I can count. The recent torture incident was sickening and I've seen college radicals from all around, but especially young black Chicagoans continue to push white privilege as a cause of the insanity.” 

“I would like to discuss how to make a difference in these environments both at a cultural or grass roots level and how Trump can help these cities who don't even seem to want his help. I am trying to start a business and continue to debate and speak up whenever I reasonably can, what else can be done?"

In Chicago, four black suspects were arrested in connection with the kidnapping and 24-48 hour torture of an eighteen year old special needs white male. The suspects streamed the assault live on Facebook, shouting "F@&k White People" and "F@&k Donald Trump" multiple times - even cutting the victim's scalp with a knife and forcing him to drink water from a toilet.

On December 19th, 2016, twelve people were killed and nearly fifty injured when a truck plowed through a Christmas market in Berlin, Germany. In the latest example of a true war on the Christmas holiday and Christians everywhere, the Islamic State quickly claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack. The terrorist suspect has also been reported to be a refugee - one of well over a million refugees allowed into Germany by Angela Merkel through her disastrous open-border policy.

A steadily increasing number of millennials are finally beginning to wake up to the choices they face within civilization. Lauren Southern's new book "Barbarians: How the Baby Boomers, Immigration and Islam Screwed My Generation" details the fall of the academic, moral and cultural standards which have lead civilization down an increasingly dark road, and the new bright light at the end of the tunnel. 

Lauren Southern is the host of "Stand Off" on TheRebel media and the author of "Barbarians: How the Baby Boomers, Immigration and Islam Screwed My Generation."

The idea of a universal basic income (also called citizen's income, basic income guarantee or universal demogrant) is a form of welfare or social security where all residents of a country regularly receive an unconditional sum of money from the government. 

While the idea of a universal basic income has gained popularity in recent years, Stefan Molyneux breaks down the problems with the proposition and explains why it, like all other forms of socialism, would end is disaster.

The Washington Post and New York Times drove the news cycle publishing claims based on “high level” sources with access to a recent intelligence security briefing involving the allegations of Russian involvement in attempting to influence the United States election. Stefan Molyneux looks at the facts behind the latest mainstream media assertions, the logical holes in the argument presented from sources privy to the high level CIA briefings, claims that the Republican National Committee (RNC) was also hacked, the weaponized IRS targeting conservative groups, Portman-Murphy Counter-Propaganda Bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, Hillary Clinton takes donations in congestion with approving Russia's accusation of Uranium One, Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos undisclosed $600 million contract with the Central Intelligence Agency, Operation Mockingbird and much much more!

Question: “Is acknowledging our specific deficiencies and differences as people divisive or helpful? From anecdotal experience, I find myself questioning whether or not it helps to know the truth especially when we're talking about genetic trends. To give a less touchy example, does it help a young girl growing up without a father to make better decisions if she knows that there's a strong likelihood she will make bad decisions due to his absence (in most cases)? Or are you accepting the behavior/likelihood by acknowledging the trend?”

Question: “I’ve worked for one year at a care home for unaccompanied minors in Sweden. How do I prepare my family for growing up in this environment and how can I help provide answers to helping these kids when they themselves identify these refugee homes as negative and hate their situation? I see multi-culturalism failing around Europe and the US, but these problems have been around so long. Shouldn’t there be a way for each culture to find their own way in each society? The crime is so high for foreigners in Sweden, and not mentioning what these immigrants do to the host population by hiding their nationality. It seems people are waking up to these false narratives. What else can we do to reverse the damage of the past 40 plus years of multiculturalism?"

Question: “After watching your video titled ‘Evidence for God?’, I reached a dilemma that I cannot solve. I am considering the possibly that there are some truths that are better left unknown. I have come to believe that atheism by itself is legitimate, however I fear for a world full of atheists because vanity and arrogance can so easily take over when one rejects the notion of a divine supervisor. With the liability inherent in atheism, how do I reconcile truth with morality?”

Question: “The founders of the United States claimed that we have natural rights and that they come from God. Atheists reject this logic because they reject God's existence. As you have stated, most atheists lean towards socialist ideologies and against the ‘noble lie.’ However, perhaps it's not a lie.”

“You have stated that Rights do not exist. But, aren't rights just those human properties - derived from biology - in which one person claims and exercises in exclusion of every other individual? These properties include vocal cords, thumbs, and brains. Do we not have a just-claim (a.k.a. natural right) to use our properties to communicate, use tools, Collaborate and think? Are not our natural Rights written in our DNA?”

Title: Stefan Molyneux: An "Inconsistency" Explained

Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3426-black-wives-matter-call-in-show-september-21-2016#t=0:0

Question: “What are the characteristics of human nature? Are those characteristics changeable? If so, how can they be changed? You have spoken on this topic a couple times, and I think I've noticed some inconsistency."

"Take the video ‘Shocking Misogynist Attacks Feminism, Defends Rape Culture,’ for example. At 15:47, you pose a mental exercise to the audience to explore the roots of human violence. At 16:14 you preface the exercise by saying that you don't 'buy the human nature argument,' and follow with: ‘saying, 'What is human nature?' is like saying 'what is the shape of water?' Well, it depends what you pour it into.’” 

“But in a later video, ‘Why The Regressive Left Has Already Lost,’ you suggest an alternative description of human nature: At 8:54, you ridicule leftists for viewing human beings as water and implying that human nature is infinitely malleable (specifically, you were criticizing the idea that immigrants can easily adapt to the culture of their new host country). I have wrestled with this issue myself, and I was wondering if you could clarify your thoughts.”

Question: “My daughter is three years old and we are following the non-aggression principle and using gentle parenting techniques. We try to be honest and forthcoming in all of our discussions and it seems cruel to me to be lying to her about Santa. I don't want to deprive her of the magic and fun of the holiday but I also do not want to impair or damage the trust we have been working so hard to maintain.” 

“I should make note that we also attend church services. I would not say we are overly religious--our discussions are very superficial. My husband and I have our beliefs but neither of us have wanted to force them upon her. I realize that just by taking her to church that is precisely what we are doing.” 

“I have conflicting thoughts on this Santa situation. I do not know with certainty that God does not exist--I would like to believe that he does. But with Santa--we all know he doesn't really exist--how can I justify one but not the other? Am I a hypocrite for allowing her to believe in Jesus but not Santa? I never want to tell her what to believe but my struggle comes in knowingly lying to her. Is it possible to tell the story of St. Nick with keeping him in the make believe world?”

Question: “After being told by a woman that she couldn't get pregnant, she got pregnant. To make matters worse, she is 35, we have only known each other for a month, she went on progesterone, and she is deciding to keep the pregnancy going despite not being in a committed relationship. Needless to say, I am concerned with the child's well-being once it is born if she raises the child as a single parent. I would like to speak to Stefan to get his perspective on what I should do...should I bite the bullet for the child's sake and embark on a relationship with a woman I don't really know, who lied and manipulated her way to a pregnancy? Or should I break off the possibility of a relationship out of respect for myself and submit to being single parents to a child and hope for the best with regards to the child's well-being?”

Note: This interview was conducted before the recent U.S. Presidential election.

Evidence suggesting the biological reality of race and that ethnicity is more than just a social construct is something that few people are willing to honestly discuss. Against all available evidence, many academics insist that human evolution ended in prehistory. Nicholas Wade joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss his book "A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History" and the impact of evolution and selective pressures on human populations. 

Nicholas Wade was a Science writer and editor with The New York Times and is the author of many books including: “Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, ” The Faith Instinct: How Religion Evolved and Why It Endures,” and “A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History.”

While studying at University of Havana in April 1948, Castro participated in the Communist-lead riots in Bogot?Colombia which lead to thousands of deaths. While many 22-year-olds were just starting their adult lives, Castro was getting revolutionary street credibility and laying the groundwork for his blood-soaked future. Fast forward to November 26th, 2016 and the controversial Cuban revolutionary and dictator is dead at 90 years old. What is the Truth About Fidel Castro?

"When feminist filmmaker Cassie Jaye sets out to document the mysterious and polarizing world of the Men’s Rights Movement, she begins to question her own beliefs. Jaye had only heard about the Men’s Rights Movement as being a misogynist hate-group aiming to turn back the clock on women’s rights, but when she spends a year filming the leaders and followers within the movement, she learns the various ways men are disadvantaged and discriminated against. The Red Pill challenges the audience to pull back the veil, question societal norms, and expose themselves to an alternate perspective on gender equality, power and privilege."

Cassie Jaye is the founder of Jaye Bird Productions and the director of the award-winning documentaries “Daddy I Do” (which examined the Abstinence-Only Movement versus Comprehensive Sex Education) and “The Right to Love: An American Family” (which followed one family’s activism fighting for same-sex marriage rights in California). Her latest project “The Red Pill” which examines the Men’s Rights Movement and gender equality.

Date: 2016-11-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=sS8RAbTeyaA
Description: There is a significant anti-male bias in society and such propaganda creates cognitive dissonance around important subjects which must be examined. Circumcision is the most common surgery in America. It affects sex, politics, religion, children, medicine, culture - all in the most personal way possible. Yet America is the only industrialized country that routinely practices infant circumcision for non-religious reasons - and we have never had a national conversation about it. Brendon Marotta's film American Circumcision will start the conversation our culture needs to have about circumcision.

“As amateur philosophers and concerned citizens, how do we begin to bring society back towards standing on principles instead of allowing our collective morals to wither away. As a clerk for an Election Bureau of a heavily contested suburban County in a key swing state, I have been exposed to shameless abuse of election laws, almost to the point of outright fraud."

"The most disheartening thing to see is that despite the election workers having good intentions, when presented the choice to stand against a questionable ballot and methods of gathering absentee votes with solid legal footing, the path of least resistance is taken to avoid conflict and swathes of votes are allowed. As a simple cog in a vast and rotting machine, where do I begin?”

MAGA MINDSET: How to Make YOU and America Great Again is not a traditional political analysis of Donald Trump or the success of his political campaign, which would be boring and useless to you.

You will understand how Mike Cernovich was able to successfully predict Donald Trump would be the Republican nominee at a time when all the professional political pundits considered his campaign to be a joke, and why, win or lose, the Trump revolution will continue beyond the 2016 election.

The relationship between Vladimir Putin's Russia and the United States has been in the public spotlight throughout the U.S. Presidential election. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has repeatedly blamed Russian involvement for many of her campaign blusters and her support of a Syrian no fly zone is a direct threat aimed at Vladimir Putin. Iben Thranholm joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss the nature of the United States conflict with Russia and why we are on the brink of World War III.

Iben Thranholm is one of Denmark’s most widely read columnists and is a former editor and radio host at the Danish Broadcasting Corporation. Thranholm has traveled extensively in the Middle East, Italy, the United States and Russia to carry out research and interviews.

Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3473-the-truth-about-americas-survival-demographics-and-the-2016-election

While many are unaware of the coming demographic winter in the United States, the future of freedom in the country will be decided in the 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Immigration, voting patterns and demographics are the only true issues that matter in this upcoming election, as Hillary Clinton's amnesty to the 11-30+ million illegal immigrants in America will prevent small government ideas from being politically viable for centuries. 

Stefan Molyneux breaks down the raw data on the foreign-born population in the United States, immigration pattern changes since the 1965 Immigration Act, cultural differences in economic freedom and corruption, national IQ, attitudes on larger vs. smaller government, political party preferences, immigrant voting patterns, the truth about libertarianism, welfare consumption rates among different demographics and the shocking truth about crime and diversity.

While the United States media distracts the American population with manufactured political scandals, the U.S. government has threatened an act of war against Vladimir Putin and Russia. 

In an attempt to shield Hillary Clinton from the fallout of the Wikileaks revelations and the onslaught of Donald Trump, the Obama Administration has taken actions which bring us to the brink of World War III.

Title: Donald Trump Is Winning | Bill Mitchell and Stefan Molyneux

While the media predicts the demise of Donald Trump's campaign for the 795th time, there remains practically no real world evidence of support for Hillary Clinton. While Trump has twice as many Google hits, massive online support, a record setting 2.6 million individual donors, huge daily rally attendance, yard signs everywhere and strong strong book and merchandise sales - Clinton's metrics are all abysmal. 

Bill Mitchell joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss the only metric where Hillary Clinton seems to do well - mainstream polling - and how those results are just as fake as her smile and personality. Why did Donald Trump suggest that Hillary Clinton and he take a drug test before the next Presidential debate? What has an incredible accurate predictor in Professor Norpoth said about this upcoming Presidential election? 

Bill Mitchell is the host and creator of YourVoice Radio and one most influential non-candidates in social media this election cycle - with close to 100,000 Twitter followers and millions of impressions daily.

Hillary and Bill Clinton made more than $153 million for 729 paid speeches between February 2001 and May 2015 - receiving an average fee of $210,795 per speech. Hillary Clinton gave 92 speeches with a standard fee of $225,000 between 2013 and 2015, collecting $21.6 million in just under two years. 

Why are the Clintons' worth so much for speaking appearances and what did she say to these large institutions behind closed doors? Clinton never released her speech transcripts, but recently Wikileaks released excepts from her speeches, obtained through John Podesta’s compromised email account.

After a slow-motion disaster of almost 10 years, the fate of one of Europe’s most important financial institutions appears to be sealed. Deutsche Bank started the year by announcing a record-setting loss in 2015 of €6.8 billion. Scandals, bad decisions, and unfortunate events – now Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank shares are down -48% on the year to $12.60, a record-setting low.

With only $15.8 billion in market capitalization, shares of the 147-year-old company now trade for only 8% of its peak price in May 2007. The bank is currently cutting 9,000 employees and shuttering operations in 10 countries. The International Monetary Fund has stated that DBK is now the most dangerous bank in the world.

Ann Coulter has logically proved that immigration is the most important issue facing the United States today. As Ann points out, if Americans cave to the scheme to bring in 30 million new liberal voters, conservatives lose on everything else, too, from the economy to social issues to foreign policy to constitutionalism, to national identity as a whole. 

Ann Coulter is the author of many New York Times bestsellers, including "Adios, America: The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole." She lectures around the country, writes a nationally syndicated weekly column, and recently released the new book "In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!"

The latest manufactured Donald Trump scandal involved the New York Times publishing the Republican candidates tax records from 1995 showing a near billion dollar annual loss. The newspaper has speculated that Trump may have used the losses accrued in 1995 as a legal write off on future tax returns. That bastard.

In this highly theoretical Zootopia universe, all the animals live in peace and harmony with each other, at the price of having nothing to eat except the odd illicit popsicle. Predators have overcome their natural instincts, have evolved past the hunger to chew on prey, and seem to have sublimated their dominant instincts into a more dangerous thirst for political power.

The grim reality soon to be learned by the West is that just because you forget about nature, does not mean that nature forgets about you.

Title: What Pisses Me Off About Keith Scott And The Charlotte Riots
Date: 2016-09-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=jEfuL6YNPM4
Description: On Tuesday night, 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Officer Brentley Vinson in the parking lot of an apartment complex. Both Scott and Officer Vinson are black, but the shooting nonetheless sparked Black Lives Matter protests which focused the eyes of the world on Charlotte, North Carolina. 

Charlotte police originally went to the complex at approximately 4pm, looking for a suspect with an outstanding warrant. Scott was not the suspect, but was observed getting out of his vehicle with a gun, before reentering the vehicle moments later. Officers approached the vehicle and Scott once again exited with the weapon in hand. After repeated orders by Police to drop his firearm, Scott was shot and killed. 

Scott’s family and Black Lives Matter protestors claim that Scott was “disabled” and was killed while he was peacefully reading a book inside his vehicle. Police have recovered a firearm from the scene, but no books were found on-site. Local protests quickly began and it did not take long for the “peaceful” protests to turn violent.

The devices were not found by law enforcement, but by homeless people who were attracted to the quality of the backpack containing the explosives.

In relation to the Chelsea bombing, surveillance video, facial recognition software and fingerprints on an undetonated device directed police to 28-year-old suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami. Rahami is a naturalized United States citizen from Afghanistan who lived with his Muslim family in an Elizabeth, New Jersey apartment.

While authorities were responding to the reports of explosive devices outside the Elizabeth, NJ train station, the FBI stopped a “vehicle of interest” related to the NY bombing and took five individuals of Middle Eastern descent into custody.

Authorities originally had reason to believe that Rahami was inside the vehicle, but he was not. All five suspects taken into custody are associates of Rahami, including at least one blood relative. The men are still being detained, but have yet to be charged with a crime. Rahami was later taken into custody after a shootout with Police in New Jersey.

Less than a week after a cease-fire agreement had been brokered by Russia between the United States and Syrian government – the United States carried out an airstrike in Eastern Syria that killed forces of President Bashar Assad.

Four U.S. Aircraft (Two F-16s and two A-10s) targeted six “troop carrier” vehicles and one tank against what it believes to be Islamic State insurgents near Deir Ezzor Airport. Syria and Russia claim that the United States actually struck a Syrian military base - which was itself surrounded by ISIS forces. The attack left between 62 and 83 Syrian soldiers dead and approximately 120 wounded. 

This attack marked the first known direct U.S. strike on the forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad and the Syrian military released a statement claiming the airstrikes were “conclusive evidence that the United States and its allies support ISIS and other terrorist organizations.”

“Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals” was written by community organizer Saul Alinsky in 1971. It has become the de facto progressive manifesto for effecting political change. 

Opening: “What follows is for those who want to change the world from what it is to what they believe it should be. The Prince was written by Machiavelli for the Haves on how to hold power. Rules for Radicals is written for the Have-Nots on how to take it away.”

Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton met with Saul Alinsky several times in 1968 while she was writing her college thesis on his community organization theories. President Barack Obama’s education was also greatly influenced by Alinsky and his theories. 

What is The Truth About Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals – and how does it work?

Title: The Morality of The Joker

Question: “One of the most difficult moral dilemmas I've been attempting to so solve is the limits of moral integrity. The impetus for this dilemma was spawned by the movie The Dark Knight. In the movie, as the Joker speaks to Batman about the police, he says:"

"See, their morals, their code... it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you, when the chips are down, these... these civilized people? They'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster, I'm just ahead of the curve."

"This is a recurring theme in the movie--the idea that people are corruptible under the right circumstances. Depending on the person, when situations become desperate enough, they will abandon their morals."

“Must a person abide by petty morality even when there is much at stake? For example, let's say that a madman is chasing after a man, and the man runs into my house to hide. Meanwhile, the madman comes knocking on my door, describing the man and asking me if I've seen him. Would it be wrong to lie in this circumstance in order to divert the madman and prevent him from killing the fleeing man?” 

“Additionally, must a person always be moral even when it involves the most frivolous circumstances? For instance, let's say that I need a pencil and I see that my roommate has one laying on his desk. If I took the pencil, then it would be considered stealing, but must I really abide by ethics in this case?”

I'm not looking for absolute proof of God exists, as that's impossible, as with the converse - definitively establishing God does not exist. Just ideas, scientific theories, and personal observations that would fall into the ‘God is possible’ column.”

“How do we get women to be patriotic again? Women in the West have been taught to question their instincts when it comes to real threats, and overreact to imaginary threats. I see this with the female response to the immigration crisis. The bigger problem is they don't realize the real threats, both physical and existential, that our men face.” 

“With one brother in the military and another in law enforcement, I know whose lives will be on the line if things get bad, but most of my female friends seem to be fine with letting the migration of those who don't support Western values to continue unabated, while complaining about their husband not understanding how hard the morning routine is with the kids. Why do women treat strangers better than their loved ones, and how do we reignite patriotism, and a love of Western men, in women?”

The police shooting of 23-year-old Sylville Smith on Saturday August 13th, 2016 in Milwaukee led to protests and eventually riots.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the mysterious $400 million payment to Iran was quid pro quo for the release of American hostages - which was fiercely denied by Barack Obama and the White House. 

“We do not pay ransom. We didn’t here, and we won’t in the future.” - President Barack Obama

On Thursday, State Department Spokesman John Kirby confirmed that the $400 million payment was held until the prisoners were released by Iran - which flew in the face of Obama's previous "it was just a coincidence" denials. Did the United States pay Iran ransom for the release of US prisoners - or was it simply leverage? Is there even a difference?

On Saturday at 3:30pm in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, two men fled from police on foot after a routine traffic stop. Two police officers pursued the suspects and after one of the suspects presented a semi-automatic pistol to police – he was shot and killed. 

The suspect was told to drop his gun, but didn’t comply, leading to the officer firing several times, hitting the man twice, once in the chest and once in the arm. The officer involved was wearing a body camera during the incident.

In mere hours after the shooting, a group of approximately 200 mostly black protestors gathered and began threatening police officers, setting local businesses on fire, attacking white bystanders and looting local shops.

According to a recent study from The University of Oxford and Said Business School examining the games between 1960 and today, the average inflation adjusted “sports-related costs” of the Summer Olympic games is $5.2 billion and the average cost of the Winter Olympics is $3.1 billion.

...but what is the human opportunity cost of the Olympic Games? Who profits from these athletic displays and what is the root cause of people investing their entire lives in many economically useless activities?

Question: "I am a 32-year-old white married female who is a stay-at-home wife. My husband and I are expecting our first child and we are experiencing all of the emotions of first-time parents. Thanks in part to your show we have made changes in our lives so I can be a stay at home mother."

"I have listened to Stefan’s most recent podcasts about the benefits of stay-at-home parents and parent-child bonding that is so crucial to life-long meaningful relationships with their children."

"My question stems from the fact that despite being raised in a two-parent home with my mother being stay-at-home, I have a very distant and non-communicative relationship with my family; specifically, my mother. Because I am soon to be a mother, I fear that if I cannot get to the bottom of why my relationship with my mother is so fractured it will carry over and negatively affect my relationship with my future children. How can I ensure that I will not do the same to my children in the years to come?"

Question: “I have been listening to the discussions with single moms lately and am amazed at their stories - I find many similarities with their histories and my own. The blaring difference being I have never gotten pregnant. I love that the single mothers have been calling to get input on how to give their kids the best lives they can, despite the choice to become a single mother."

"My question is somewhat similar - how can I improve myself and strengthen my ability to detect and avoid low-quality men to ensure a good future for the children I want to eventually have with a healthy husband?”

"Taken into Custody' exposes the greatest and most destructive civil rights abuse in America today. Family courts and Soviet-style bureaucracies trample basic civil liberties, entering homes uninvited and taking away people's children at will, then throwing the parents into jail without any form of due process, much less a trial. No parent, no child, no family in America is safe."

Question: "What is the philosophical meaning of the word 'justice'? I've see the term used in so many different contexts, and in combination with so many other words, so it's clearly an important word to define. Yet upon reflection, I realized that I could not come up with a consistent definition of the term. To me, this topic is especially relevant in an era when it's become commonplace for people to toss around the term 'social justice' as catch-all term for whatever agenda they feel like pushing.”

Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3371-the-truth-about-the-fall-of-rome-modern-parallels

Western civilization hangs by a thread - to rescue it, we must delve deep into the past to find out how to save the future. The fall of the Roman Empire closely mirrors the challenges currently facing Europe and North America – toxic multiculturalism, rampant immigration, runaway feminism, debt, currency corruption, wildly antagonistic politics – everything we need to know to save everything we love is written deep in the history of ancient Rome – all we need to do is look!

Stefan Molyneux, host of Freedomain Radio, takes you on a journey deep into the philosophical, cultural, economic and political causes of the decline and death of ancient Rome. Once you understand what happened in the past, you will never again be confused by what is happening now - and never be more certain about how to change what is to come.

Sources: http://www.fdrurl.com/fall-of-rome

Please have a browse through these sources, since I have gathered a wide variety of thoughts, arguments and ideas into one presentation. In particular, the argument that barbarians are analogous to terrorists was written about by Morris Berman in 2001. The four stages of Empire was written about by Sir John Glubb in the mid 20th century. He also wrote about the possible role of feminism in the decline of Empires. I hope that this presentation inspires you to examine the Fall of Rome for yourself, and that the sources provided turn out to be a useful starting point.

"Can you help me understand the role of environmental regulations in a Free Market and Free society? What happens when your upstream neighbor decides he wants to dump all of his shit in the river?”

“On April 10th my husband and I found out that our Colorado state GOP convention had resulted in all our state delegates bound to vote for Ted Cruz. As Trump supporters, we were shocked and angered. Late that night, with my husband’s courage and my millennial know-how, we created a website calling for a protest of the Colorado GOP and the rigged system that silenced the will of the voters.” 

“The next day, our website was linked on Drudge Report and what resulted was the most exciting, terrifying, and life-changing week of our lives. We spend the next couple days doing interviews for national and local media. Our interactions with the media were interesting to say the least, as they never seemed to know how to report on intelligent, educated, upper-middle class Trump supporters.” 

“The reaction from our family and friends was also amusing and revealing. Some of our most conservative family members were critical while some of the most liberal were supportive.” 

“The protest we held on April 15th was a success. It reinforced the evidence that there were political forces at work to suppress the will of the people. Donald Trump himself wrote an editorial the day before the protest deriding the “election” that occurred without voters.” 

“It has been difficult dealing with the feeling of exposure that has come with national media attention. Do you have any advice for maintaining our courage to speak up for a righteous cause as time goes on?”

Question: "I've listened to a few shows where Stefan talks about hypergamy and understand why it's part of our social fabric. As a woman, I'm wondering if hypergamy is rationally or scientifically correlated to feelings of sexual desire and arousal. Does a man with more money, education, and status elicit a stronger sexual desire from a woman that lasts past the initial lust phase?”

During morning mass, two Islamic terrorists entered the Church of the Gambetta near Rouen, Normandy, France, while shouting “Daesh” which is Arabic for “Islamic State,” and held several members of the congregation hostage. 

Only thirty miles from where Allied troops landed in 1944, the terrorists performed what has been described as “an Arabic sermon from the altar” before forcing eighty four-year old Father Jacques Hamel to his knees, and then to the ground. 

One of the terrorists then proceeded to slit his throat, and the other filmed video as the priest bled out in front of his congregation. Early reports described the gruesome attack as an outright “beheading.”

In light of WikiLeaks releasing Democratic National Committee 20,000 emails which show shocking levels of corruption and bias against Bernie Sanders - Debbie Wasserman Schultz has announced her resignation as party chair on the eve of the DNC convention. 

The WikiLeaks document dump also shows DNC collaboration with the mainstream media, coordination of what questions Hillary Clinton should be asked, demands to case certain types of coverage, the direction of attacks towards both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders within the media, illegal campaign financing events and much much more!

Stefan Molyneux is joined by Mike Cernovich of DangerandPlay.com to discuss the controversial fallout of this massive news story and the lengths to which social media and the press have gone to hide the Democratic National Committee Wikileaks scandal.

On July 22nd, 2016, eighteen-year-old German-Iranian dual national Ali David Sonboly murdered three women and six men during the latest German shooting/terrorist attack in Munich.

This attack comes only four days after teenage asylum seeker Muhammad Riyad injured nine people in a Wuerzburg, Germany regional train using both an ax and a knife. Officials have reported that Riyad was “inspired” by ISIS, the Islamic State group, but not “officially” connected to them. 

Four days before that, 84 people - including 10 children - were killed and 308 were injured in the Bastille Day Terrorist Attack in Nice, France. Tunisian born Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel drove a massive box truck into a crowd while reportedly shouting "Allahu Akbar" and ISIS beheading videos and Omar Mateen research was later found on his computer.

A lot of people on the left genuinely care about the poor, the disenfranchised, and minorities struggling to achieve peace and prosperity in their own failing communities. Unfortunately, these leftists are generally getting their information about Donald Trump from hostile sources, and don’t really understand why the poor, the disenfranchised and minorities support him to such a significant extent.

As a public service, I’m going to do a translation of Donald Trump’s 2016 RNC nomination acceptance speech, in the hopes of helping to bridge the gap between concern for the poor, and Trump’s positions.

New studies have failed to find even a single positive benefit to spanking children and a near endless amount of horrible effects. Dr. Elizabeth Gershoff joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss her latest study, refuting the common pro-spanking arguments, why social justice warriors have nothing to do with less aggressive parenting, associating love with physical abuse and ending the escalating cycle of violence in relationships.

Question: "Last we spoke, I proudly took on the badge of honor for speaking the truth in a time where lies and hatred is profitable. I tried talking sense into my family and friends but they've all rejected me with irrational ideals based purely on emotions and no facts. They call me a disgrace to my own race and my black friends reject everything I say by repeating ‘you're not black, you're an uncle tom and whites are only tolerating your kind for now.’ 

"I've lost a great sense of hope and optimism in society. I feel that we are on a path of self-destruction on a level we have not seen for a long time... How else can I get through to them when they refuse to look at facts?"

As France was celebrating Bastille Day – a holiday which signifies the storming of the Bastille prison during the French Revolution of 1789 – keys were placed into the ignition of a large truck which would soon be turned into a murder weapon. 

As people watched fireworks during celebrations in the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, France – a large truck smashed through crowd of men, women and children, killing eighty people and injuring at least a hundred more.

Over the last several years, a series of high profile politicized police shootings has given rise to Black Lives Matter and large anti-police protest movement. A recent police shooting left Philando Castile dead and made Lavish Diamond Reynolds an overnight celebrity through her Facebook livestreaming of the incidents’ aftermath. While the mainstream media predictably jumped on the “racist white police officer” narrative – the facts paint a much different picture. 

Charles C. Johnson from Got News joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss his research into the story, including: Philando Castile being pulled over due to matching a BOLO description from a recent armed robbery, the background of Diamond Reynolds and much much more!

In light of Bernie Sanders endorsement of Hillary Clinton, many of his supporters are shocked and appalled that he’d support a candidate he openly described as unqualified and corrupt. Stefan Molyneux offers a sympathetic message to those who have been burned once again by the political establishment and explains why this cycle of political disappointment is often inevitable.

FBI Director James Comey recently revealed that he will not be recommending criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her use of a private server to house and process her emails while Secretary of State. Only days after meeting with Bill Clinton, United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch also announced that no charges will be pursued against the presumptive Democratic Presidential nominee. 

Stefan Molyneux is joined by Bill Whittle to discuss why Hillary Clinton’s legal troubles are far from over, a breakdown of the laws which she broke while Secretary of State, the fallout from the dissolution of law and order within the United States, and the importance of speaking truth in the battle to save Western Civilization.

Black crime and violence against whites, gays, women, seniors, young people and many others is drastically out of proportion. It won't quit. Neither will the excuses. Or the denials. Or the black on white hostility. Or those who encourage it. Colin Flaherty joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss the unspoken truth about black on white crime and the lengths the mainstream media goes to hide it while perpetuating the black victimhood narrative. 

Colin Flaherty is an award winning writer whose work has been published in more than 1000 places around the globe, including the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, Miami Herald, Washington Post, Bloomberg Business Week, Time magazine, and others.

Question: "What is patriotism? How does a people or a society become patriotic or develop a deep-deeded love for their country and its well-being? How is patriotism lost as a society - that feeling, that passion, diminished over time? What are the consequences? Finally, are these global rumblings simply the catalyst for reigniting one’s love for country and kin - is this the natural order of things?"

The Center for Individual Rights had been representing Rebecca Friedrichs and nine other California teachers in a lawsuit against the California Teachers Association - arguing that forced union association and dues payments are illegal. The case made it all the way to the United States Supreme Court.

Lead plaintiff Rebecca Friedrichs has taught for twenty-six years and says, “the union has become what it used to fight - a powerful, entrenched organization more focused on self-preservation than educating children and protecting teachers.”

The CTA has used millions of dollars in compulsory dues to become one of the most powerful political organizations in the state of California - promoting issues with which many teachers fundamentally disagree which highlights the compelled speech inherent in mandatory union membership of any kind.

Stefan Molyneux speaks with plaintiff Rebecca Friedrichs and lawyer Terence J. Pell about the nature of the Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association case, the likelihood of victory, the consequences of forced association and what this means for government unions nationwide!

Title: No Criminal Charges for Hillary Clinton!

Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3336-no-criminal-charges-for-hillary-clinton

FBI Director James Comey has revealed that he will not be recommending criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her use of a private server to house and process her emails while Secretary of State.

"From the group of 30,000 e-mails returned to the State Department, 110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were “up-classified” to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent."

"With respect to the thousands of e-mails we found that were not among those produced to State, agencies have concluded that three of those were classified at the time they were sent or received, one at the Secret level and two at the Confidential level. There were no additional Top Secret e-mails found. Finally, none of those we found have since been “up-classified.”"

"...seven e-mail chains concern matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received. These chains involved Secretary Clinton both sending e-mails about those matters and receiving e-mails from others about the same matters. There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation. In addition to this highly sensitive information, we also found information that was properly classified as Secret by the U.S. Intelligence Community at the time it was discussed on e-mail (that is, excluding the later “up-classified” e-mails)."

None of these e-mails should have been on any kind of unclassified system, but their presence is especially concerning because all of these e-mails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full-time security staff, like those found at Departments and Agencies of the U.S. Government—or even with a commercial service like Gmail."

Question: “I am a black atheist living in the south who is a former democrat. I can see the merits and values that religion gives certain people, and the fact I don't agree with the medium in which the message is given is beyond the point. Also I am against big government regulation and think they should be granted so much power given past events."

"Recently while talking to a close friend I told him that my ideals and views align more with conservative and he immediately told I couldn't because one I am an atheist. Can atheist consider himself a conservative?”

Discussions about ethnic and gender differences in intelligence are seen as impolite by many, but in an age where the failure of others is held up as an example of sexism or racism, it is an essential topic to discuss.

Dr. Richard Lynn is Professor Emeritus for University of Ulster and is the author of several books on the subject of intelligence, including IQ and the Wealth of Nations, The Global Bell Curve, Race Differences in Intelligence: An Evolutionary Analysis and more!

On Thursday 6/16 at approximately 1pm British Labour MP Jo Cox was allegedly attacked, stabbed, shot and ultimately killed by 52-year-old Thomas Mair outside a constituency meeting. 

The news media immediately ran with reports that Mair had shouted “Britain First” - which is a political party in the United Kingdom. It was everywhere – front page news on almost all the major papers – Mair was a Brexit supporter motivated to attack a Vote Remain campaigner - but what is the truth?

Title: Why Anti-Donald Trump Protesters Hate Freedom

Question: “My girlfriend and I attended a Trump rally in California and witnessed the violence first hand. We are now seeing threats of violence against Whites emerge on social media from friends of ours who have gone full blown Hispanic-Supremacist.” 

“We have seen firsthand the effects illegal immigration has on our community. Our schools are flooded with low-IQ Latino students who choke the resources of our State and yet face dismal graduation and employment rates.” 

“We have seen the violence spike in our home town as the White population has been gradually replaced with low skilled immigrants who lack the work ethic and community building skills that made California a once great State.” 

“We no longer feel comfortable wearing our Trump gear in public, and for us, ‘White Flight’ is increasingly becoming what seems the only choice if we ever want to start a family. What can we do in our daily lives to protect ourselves and still try to fight back against the invasion that threatens our home? Are we justified in moving if we feel the violence against Whites escalates? We are split on whether or not we have a duty to stand and fight for California. Finally, if the worst happens and Hillary Clinton is elected president, what is the next step for our movement?”

The mainstream media continues to wage its war on reality through the propagation of false narratives related to the Orlando Terrorist Attack. What important questions aren’t being asked and why? 

Mike Cernovich joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss the terrorist attack at a gay nightclub in Orlando, the illusion of competence from those in positions of authority, the origin of false media narratives, the horizontal enforcement of political correctness, the erosion of free speech and the war for the survival of Western Civilization.

On June 6th, the 25th Anniversary edition of Orlando’s annual weeklong Gay Days festival concluded. The festival is one of largest gay pride events in the world and saw an estimated 150,000 members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community attend area theme parks, nightclubs and special events.

On June 12th at approximately 2am, the 29-year-old Muslim son of Afghanistan immigrants, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen entered Pulse nightclub in Florida and began shooting into the crowd of over 320 mostly LGBT patrons leaving at least 50 people dead and 53 others injured. Orlando Police Officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect – killing him on-site and releasing an estimated 30 hostages.

Question: “As massive immigration is becoming more globalized, and society is degrading into a mixed multi-culture, there will be no doubt be an epidemic of young people growing up without a concrete tradition to follow. What will become of these cultures, if globalism succeeds on destroying true cultural diversity?”

Question: "I'm a black female, born in the U.S. to Caribbean immigrant parents. Lately, I've been struggling with feelings of alienation and disappointment because even though I feel fully American and I love being American, I feel as though I don't fit in with any group. I feel like I have little in common with African Americans culturally speaking, but I don't have much in common with white Americans either; I've noticed a clear divide in many aspects of my life. To complicate matters, I'm pretty conservative so I feel as though that turns many people my age off of me because 'liberalism' is the ‘correct’ posture. Naturally, this makes me less inclined to develop any sort of relationships with them either.”

“My greatest concern is marriage. Family has always been foremost for me and I've always wanted a husband and children. However, I feel like my options are severely limited due to the illegitimacy crisis in the black ‘community’ and due to general black underachievement. As I've gotten older, I've become more doubtful of interracial marriage, as I worry that the children will be confused as to their identity."

"All of this has been causing me a great deal of anxiety lately. I wanted to ask your advice on navigating relationships (casual, friendships, romantic) given my situation and what your advice for managing my feelings of alienation would be.”

In recent interviews, Donald Trump has expressed on his belief that Judge Gonzalo Curiel has treated him unfairly in the Trump University civil lawsuit. 

The Judge was born in the United States, had parents who immigrated from Mexico and has positively spoken of his Mexican heritage in the past. 

Trump commented that the Judge’s Mexican heritage may be a factor in some of the recent court decisions - given his own strong stance on illegal immigration and trade with Mexico.

There are numerous new videos of white male Donald Trump supporters being attacked, sucker-punched and kicked in San Jose by mobs of angry Anti-Trump protestors waving Mexican flags. 

American flags were burned and trampled as Anti-Trump protestors flashed gang signs while chanted things such as “no more hate in our state,” “Trump is a fascist,” “American was never great,” and “Bernie, Bernie, Bernie.” 

As always with the mainstream media, somehow Trump supporters being attacked by an angry mob is the fault of Donald Trump. With the Regressive Left, facts don’t matter and will be explicitly ignored to suit their chosen narrative. An information war is being waged, and who exactly is on the side of the truth?

"What happens to these ‘newcomers’ when the assumption (i.e., the infinite supply of necessities) that Northern European populations based their egalitarian immigration policy on no longer exists - and the domestic population have to compete with the ‘new arrivals’ for resources if/when the becomes scarce?“

Title: The Truth About Angry Birds: The Movie

One of the oldest myths of mankind is that during a time of penultimate crisis, ancient heroes will return to the land in order to rescue society from its own blind and self-destructive foolishness. 

For the first 15 or 20 minutes of The Angry Birds Movie, I felt bored, frustrated and alienated – and then I got it, and had to bow before a spectacularly confident stroke of movie-making genius.

Title: The Corruption of Science: What They Won't Tell You!

Question: “I am a 24-year-old graduate student in medicinal chemistry/chemical biology. I had been admitted to various different schools and had multiple offers from individual labs upon finishing my undergrad degree. I eventually made the best decision I could have with the information that had been made available at the time and I picked a specific medicinal chemistry/chemical biology lab that seemed to have copious amounts of both money and publications. The reason I chose this lab was that it seemed to be the best place to propel my career forward despite it being 5,000km away from my home, family, and friends.“ 

“As I was gearing up for the long and grueling five years that were to come, I saw the lab I had chosen for what it really was. The reason this particular lab had so much money and fame was because he was forging his results. And presented these erroneous results to both private and public funding organizations in an attempt to gather more money for himself. Worse still, when graduate students, post docs, or lab techs brought the non-consistent data to his attention, he simply would brush them off and tell them to hide the information.” 

“It even got so bad that the professor fired a couple of post-docs and graduate students because he thought they weren't going along with his manipulated data. This professor is more concerned in being the rock-star of the university and the celebrity of the city than he is in being an honest scientist in the pursuit of truth. Sadly, I think this attitude is pervasive in the minds of many of my colleagues. I think this is so because our society has a tendency to view scientists as the new "priests" and science as the new ‘God,’ as you have so precisely pointed out.” 

“In short, I have two questions that I was hoping you'd help me answer. Firstly, how can I as an individual up-and-coming scientist help prevent the forging and manipulation of data from happening within the scientific community (particularly in my field: medicinal chemistry/chemical biology). And secondly, how can I play a part in "de-priestifying" scientists and help bring this careerism, which can often end up with a lot of innocent people suffering, to a halt?”

Question: “In your wide ranging interview with Peter Schiff, as in most of your opinions, I sensed an avoidance from meaningful discussion of taxation, and of the philosophy thereof."

"The Trump campaign has correctly identified taxation of imports as a necessary change from present practice, but without identifying its’ most meaningful justification, taxation unequal to that on national production."

"What is your opinion of importing goods and services at a cost excluding the same level of taxation included in the cost of those nationally produced? And secondly, can you justify a taxation base of income?”

In the aftermath of the Stock Market Crash of October 1929, financial panic gripped the United States of America. The Great Depression (1929-1941) was the longest-lasting sustained economic downturn in the history of the Western industrialized world. 

Foundation for Economic Education President Lawrence W. Reed joins Stefan Molyneux to debunk the conventional view and they discuss the central role that government policy played in fostering this legendary catastrophe.

Lawrence W. Reed is the President of the Foundation for Economic Education and the author of many books, including “Great Myths of the Great Depression.”

OK, so Doom 2016 has been released, so roll out your caffeinated IV drip, get your eye drops and get ready to not go to the bathroom - or even blink - until the sun rises tomorrow, at which point your eyes will be so bloodshot you'll think you're still on Mars anyway.

Over the past decade or two, there has been a somewhat depressing theme in first-person shooters, which is the attempt to build some sort of plot around the mindless kaleidoscopic pixel mayhem that originated the genre. Characters have been given back stories, family relationships, neuroses, sex drives, romance and, heaven help us, some sort of conscience...

Under the crippling weight of massive currency inflation, food shortages, power outages, increasing disease prevalence, a fall in oil prices, drought and political mismanagement – Venezuela has essentially become a failed state. 

What did the late President Hugo Chávez and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela do to lead the country down this path? What has new President Nicolás Maduro done as he’s ruled the country by decree? Why aren't you hearing more about the origin of these economic problems and what does this mean for neighboring countries?

There Will Be No Economic Recovery. Prepare Yourself Accordingly.

Question: “I'm from the island of Puerto Rico. Lately in the local news and media, the hottest subject is ‘The Mental Health of the Puerto Rican people.’ This arises because professionals attribute the ailments of our society: crime, rape, murder and recently the amount of pedophilia, to our low standards on the subject of Mental Health. The governments solution has been to spend millions of dollars, even with the islands non-existent economy, into public mental health services. Are mental health issues the cause of the problems in Puerto Rico?”

Question: "I agree with many of Donald Trump’s stated policies, though I may not agree with many of his characterizations of immigrants. That aside, I find his foreign policy most concerning."

"I understand that secrecy is necessary as a part of military strategy, but then why hasn't Trump had independent and respected military strategists review his plans behind closed doors and then give public endorsements? Knowing that you had to keep secrets ahead of time, but then failing to mitigate the impact this has on the public seems like a major misstep."

"Moreover, his statements about killing the families of terrorists, seems to me irreconcilable with the NAP. How, for instance, can you justify the killing of terrorist's grandparents?"

She has many qualities in a woman that I like. She is attractive, able to hold a professional job, and is able to raise children in a relatively healthy way."

"She has also become receptive to some of the things you talk about in your show, such as problems with welfare programs and immigration. However, as someone who looks forward to having a child or two of my own someday, I am uncertain if it makes sense to settle down with her or if it would be best to move on and start fresh.”

"My foremost object of interest would be land in an economical sense (that is, landmass and natural resources). Doesn't complete procurement of land trespass on future generations freedom? I think it is pretty clear that the radical viewpoint in either direction leads to bizarre situations. Where do we draw the line, and how do we justify this?”

While there are economic scare stories, concerns about international trade complications and fears about the United Kingdom becoming isolated on a world stage - make no mistake that upcoming EU Referendum vote is truly now about Immigration and the European Migrant Crisis. 

The United Kingdom decides it’s future on June 23rd, 2016 - and it’s now or never when it comes to saving Britain.

I would wager that among those with high IQ, that there is a large portion of individuals that have to stand on the Right of most issues - as I do. Further, by removing the paradigm of religion, and the immunity to rational discourse it provides, it will allow us to properly diagnose certain religions as being barbaric. Can you provide a rational argument of a societal archetype that would concurrently support the continued existence of religion and the much needed condemnation of belief systems antithetical to any rational person?”

Question: “I'm a 41-year-old white single female who was a ‘bad girl’ in her 20s. I had an absent father, but raised by a loving Christian mom. I've struggled to see how I ended up this way because it went against my core self. Can you help me identify the familial and societal reasons I ended up on this dead end in my personal life, and in the process, maybe help some younger women avoid the same trap?”

After Donald Trump’s overwhelming victory in Indiana - Senator Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich have dropped out of the primary race – leaving Trump as the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee.

Stefan Molyneux and the Freedomain Radio team discuss the terrible week that Ted Cruz had prior to Indiana, John Kasich’s odd press conference choices, how many in both the mainstream and alternative media have destroyed their credibility, how Trump will do against Hillary Clinton in the general election and how we knew this would be the ultimate result back in August 2015.

Question: “I am a 50-year-old woman who has been in a long term relationship with a married man for almost 19 years now. We have a 17-year-old son together. My boyfriend is a very good and religious man. We have a good relationship except for the fact that he refuses to get divorced even though he is no longer living with his wife and children."

"My question is obvious should I continue in a relationship that doesn't make me completely happy? Also why do I feel the need to stay even though I'm clearly not happy in this situation? Why can't I let go so I can hopefully find someone who will want to build a life with me?”

Question: “How far or low can Sweden go in accepting Muslim immigrants? I understand to a degree why the government can`t get enough of them - millions of people, highly dependent on the government welfare can probably keep the ruling left in power. But what is wrong with the Swedes? Why are they putting up with all that?"

"The negative consequences are pretty obvious to see even without having to use any statistics. Crime, rape, no-go zones, things that few decades ago nobody would believe are going on in Sweden. Seemingly the vast majority of Swedes are fine with that. Why?"

"Is it some sort of historical guilt for not taking part in the World Wars? Is it that the Swedes are afraid of conflict and would rather accept the situation than try to do something to change it, or at least voice concerns?”

In the midst of the European Migrant Crisis, Sweden has been said to be on the verge of economic collapse under the weight of mass Muslim immigration.

Question: “I am a 27-year-old proud stay at home mother (with the thanks of Stefan's shows on YouTube about the benefits). I was going to continue my career with a large company after my daughter's birth, but came across Stefan’s shows on abandonment. I spoke with my husband and we both agreed we would change our lifestyle so that I could stay home. He found a better paying job because he has a STEM degree and we moved states, downsized our home and live on a budget." 

"One week after I gave birth we moved. I never have regretted our decision and am thankful for such a wonderful man who provides for me and our daughter.” 

“Why do single mothers take zero responsibility for who they bring home around their children? Why do they blame the man and not themselves? To add on the topic why are stay at home mothers portrayed as having zero ambition and uneducated?”

Question: “What role would you see faith and religion playing in our current global and western civilization setting? As a pastor of a liberal protestant denomination I am not hopeful that we can contribute much. At least those of us in the mainline protestant denominations. Generally, like the body politic and academia, I fear we are too far gone. If you want to see out of control feminism and multiculturalism run amok, attend one of our seminaries, that is, before the last one closes its doors.”

Title: The Truth About Aristotle

Description: MP3: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3288/the-truth-about-aristotle
Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3288-the-truth-about-aristotle

A compelling introduction to Aristotle, considered by some the smartest person who ever lived.

Aristotle was considered so dominant in philosophy that for centuries in the Middle Ages, he was simply referred to as “The Philosopher.” He invented logic; his scientific classifications are still more or less in use today.

Aristotle’s thinking has always been the strongest line of defense against relativism, subjectivism and mysticism. Aristotle empowers the individual, promotes skepticism of authority.

Aristotle saved Western civilization from the Dark Ages - learn how his philosophy can benefit your life in the here and now!

Question: "For ten years now I've been living comfortably getting by working as a male stripper. I know I am talented and capable of more, however I only do the bare minimum, which is all I need to pay my bills and get laid. I am burning inside to do more, my ideas are endless, but I always quit and revert back to this lifestyle every time I try something new and ambitious. Why am I so damn lazy?”

Soundclound: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3266-donald-trump-takes-ny-ted-cruz-delegate-controversy-continues

Following the Colorado Delegate Controversy, Ted Cruz received criticism for “stealing” delegates in Georgia disproportionate to his voter support in the state. Donald Trump has made claims that the Republican primary process is “rigged” by the establishment and is working to subvert the will of the people. 

Leading into the New York primary, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders supporters have complained about rules which hinder “insurgent” candidates to the benefit of establishment politicians. Will the Republican establishment be able to stop Donald Trump? What is Ted Cruz’s political future? Are the Republicans headed towards a contested convention? Does the primary prove that Donald Trump could never beat Hillary Clinton in New York during a general election?

The Global Survey of Circumcision Harm (GSCH) was launched because the medical community has never investigated the long-term adverse physical, sexual, emotional or psychological consequences of infant/childhood circumcision on the health of adult men. 

From his film Whose Body? Whose Rights? to his ongoing Global Survey of Circumcision Harm, Tim Hammond has spoken out for decades about the right of boys and men to a whole body, and about the lifelong damages caused by male circumcision.

Question: “My Girlfriend and I have had intense discussions when confronting the issue of immigration of Middle Eastern refugees to Europe. The tension arises when arguing about when and when no to help such people. My Girlfriend believes that these people are in need and that they can change.” 

“When I argued that we need to turn the boats to Greece back, I was called a racist, egoist, heartless and cruel. I am usually told that I am too obsessed with immigration, that she is tired, that I am tiring, and I should not make arguments that apply to emotions, such as arguing that a bomb could explode and kill our families like what happened in Brussels recently.” 

“How can we continue as a healthy couple with our respective beliefs? Is it even possible? The disagreements currently are at a point where it’s an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object.”

Is Donald Trump being cheated out of the Republican Presidential nomination? 

Without a single vote being cast by Republican voters in Colorado, Ted Cruz won 21 delegates from the state’s seven congressional assemblies and 13 delegates at the state convention on Saturday April 9th, 2016. While the Colorado GOP establishment changed the primary process in August 2015 – the opposition to Trump delegates has supporters of the businessman up in arms.

Over the last year, 400 journalists have been secretly decoding over 11.5 million documents which were leaked from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. An estimated 2.6 terabytes of data show several decades and billions of dollars in transactions in offshore vehicles for corporations, investment funds and billionaires. 

United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron and Russian President Vladimir Putin are claimed to be implicated in the leaks – but some very important information is missing – namely Americans and United States corporations. 

Stefan Molyneux is pissed off at the controversy surrounding the Panama Papers and breaks down the United States as an international tax haven, protecting your assets from theft, the political purposes of this “leak,” the involvement of George Soros and the failure of modern journalism once again.

Question: “In previous videos you've assumed the stance that the opposite of determinism is free will. But the opposite of a determined event is a random one, not a chosen one."

"To quote Sam Harris ‘Either our wills are determined by prior causes and we are not responsible for them, or they are the product of chance and we are not responsible for them.’"

"The subjective experience of deliberation seems much more akin to a progress bar filling on a computer than anything else. Moreover, the popular idea of free will seems to be doing a lot of harm to society, particularly in our legal systems. What positive effect does our notion of free will have, and where's the evidence for it?”

Question: “In a recent show, in context of the Migrant Crisis, you expressed that you were ‘on the fence’ about whether Europe ‘deserves to be saved.’ First, you should know that most Europeans that still have a spine have a distinct dislike for generalizations that involve all of Europe, since that covers everything from the lazy and corrupt Greece to the hard-working and innovative Switzerland – and arguably, a good chunk of Turkey and Russia.”

Soundcloud: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3252/the-danger-of-hope-call-in-show-april-5th-2016

Question: “From our observations, Ted Cruz is receiving significant support from the Objectivist online community. Some say they support him because, while flawed, he's still the most principled pro-freedom candidate available. Others explicitly support him only because he's not Donald Trump. This is coming from a community that has historically identified religion as the gravest threat to the culture, to the point that key Objectivist intellectuals endorsed voting Democrat in 2004 and 2008. Yet now that the Republicans have a viable non-religious candidate, Trump has morphed into the new gravest threat to America.” 

“The mental gymnastics we've seen to justify this position have been truly astounding and suggest some visceral emotion is driving the anti-Trump/pro-Cruz response. As long-time Objectivists ourselves, it's disturbing to us to see this coming from a community with a professed commitment to reason. What do you think is the root of this response to Trump, and what does it mean for the hope of turning the culture toward true commitment to reason?”

Hillary Clinton is running for president as an “advocate of women and girls,” but there is another shocking side to her story that has been carefully covered up—until now. In the groundbreaking book "The Clintons' War on Women," New York Times bestselling author Roger Stone and researcher and alternative historian Robert Morrow map the arc of Bill and Hillary’s crimes and cover-ups. Anyone who cares about the future of the United States will want to read this tell-all, exposing the appalling, unvarnished, and ugly truth about the Clintons.

Roger Stone joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss the appalling history of the Clinton family, Hillary's current campaign for President, what Bernie Sanders won't say that could win him the Democrat nomination, the political establishments opposition to Donald Trump and what to expect at the Republican convention in Cleveland, Ohio. 

Roger Stone is a well-known political operative and pundit. A veteran of nine national presidential campaigns and has served as a senior campaign aide to three Republican presidents. He is author of the New York Times bestseller “The Man Who Killed Kennedy: The Case Against LBJ,” as well as “The Clintons' War on Women” and “Jeb! and the Bush Crime Family: The Inside Story of an American Dynasty.”

During the 2016 Presidential Election cycle, the Republican Primary has been the focus of the mainstream media and the candidacy of Hillary Clinton has been seen as inevitable. 

Much like Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has changed the plans of the Republican party establishment - Senator Bernie Sanders continues to be a thorn in the side of Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.

The 2016 Democratic National Convention will be held on July 25th, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. With increasing awareness of scandals involving Hillary Clinton – including an upcoming interview with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey – Sanders won’t relent in his battle to become the Democrat nominee for President of the United States. 

Much like Trump’s battle against the Republican establishment and the large corporate interests funding the other Presidential candidates, Sanders has faced an uphill battle against the Democrat establishment and the lobbyist/special interest groups which resist political change of any kind.

The massive feminization of culture has had a major impact on European politics and the decisions which have lead to the European Migrant Crisis. Iben Thranholm joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss the deficiency of masculinity in European culture, how feminism has programmed women to see men as the enemy and the future of western civilization. 

"As the refugee crisis erupted and overwhelmed Europe, its political leaders - spearheaded by German Chancellor Angela Merkel - acted like timid mother hens, not as strong men responsible for guarding their country from an invasion." - Iben Thranholm

Iben Thranholm is one of Denmark’s most widely read columnists and is a former editor and radio host at the Danish Broadcasting Corporation. Thranholm has traveled extensively in the Middle East, Italy, the United States and Russia to carry out research and interviews. She has been awarded for her investigative research into Danish media coverage of religious issues.

Question: “I am an African American male - had a 4.3 GPA in high school, scored in the top 2% of SAT takers, got accepted into an Ivy League School, and have a full ride from undergrad and graduate school all the way through a PhD. I'm also on the guaranteed medical school path which entails that I if I keep up my GPA, I am guaranteed a spot in medical school without having to take the MCAT." 

"Because of my accomplishments. I've always been considered a genius by my family - the one who's going to become a doctor and take care of everyone. The ‘don't forget me when you get famous’ guy. Though this often bugged me, I dealt with it. Unfortunately, this has spread to not only my family, but the entire ‘black’ community at large as well. I've had numerous teachers, principals, religious leaders, and mentors tell me that I need to ‘give back’ and become a leader for my race once I make it to wherever I'm going." 

"I realize that there exist multiple problems within the African American community, but I'm a little cynical as to how that directly coincides with my success. I really want to go into health politics, so I am not really interested in race issues per say; rather, I want to help with poverty related health issues (some correlation, cloudy causation). Do you believe successful minorities have the ‘obligation’ to facilitate the restoration of their communities? If yes, monetarily? Through investments? Through advocation?”

Question: “Two of my friends were killed by ISIS in the Brussels, Belgium Terrorist Attack on Tuesday March 22nd, 2016…”

Reports show at least 34 people are dead and 170 injured after two separate Terrorist bombings rocked Brussels, Belgium on the morning of March 22nd, 2016. Two nail bomb explosions occurred at the Brussels Airport near the American Airlines and Brussels airlines check-in desks and authorities later discovered a unexploded suicide vest on the scene. Shouts in Arabic were reportedly heard prior to the explosions.

Only seventy-nine minutes after the airport terrorist attack, another bombing decimated a Metro station near the EU headquarters in the Maelbeek area of Brussels. Two suspects related to the attacks were arrested only a mile from the Maelbeek area Metro station.

Stefan Molyneux and G. Edward Griffin discuss the basics of the central banking scheme, the secrecy which went into the creation of the Federal Reserve System in the United States, why central banking is important, the true nature of the income tax, the government control of currency interest rates, the erosion of market signals by government policies, the possibility of a cashless society, the similarity between the Republican/Democrat establishment and the dangers of collectivism.

Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump continues to increase his lead in national polls and accumulate more delegates than his opposition. At this point, Trump is the clear choice of conservative voters to be the Republican nominee and presidential candidate.

While many of his harshest critics have accepted his status as the likely Republican nominee – efforts persist to stop him.

If Trump gains 1,237 delegates prior to the start of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio on July 18th, he clinches the nomination. 

If Trump doesn’t reach 1,237 delegates prior to the convention – he could be denied the nomination via a contested convention despite being the choice of most Republican voters.

The Hulk Hogan v. Gawker trial was a battle between the First Amendment, guaranteeing free speech and a free press, and the Fourteenth Amendment, regarding the Real American right to privacy and simple common decency. Brother. 

Nearly a decade ago, Hogan was secretly filmed having sex with Heather Clem, the wife of his friend Bubba the Love Sponge. Gawker later received the video from an anonymous source and completed their heel turn by publishing an excerpt without permission. The story was titled: “Even for a Minute, Watching Hulk Hogan Have Sex in a Canopy Bed is Not Safe For Work but Watch it Anyway.” 

The former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) champion filed a lawsuit against Gawker asking for $100 million dollars in damages - prompting the media company to say their prayers and consume copious amounts of vitamins. 

The jury’s verdict came crashing down and hurt inside - finding in favor of Hogan and awarding him $115 million compensatory damages: $55 million for economic harm and $60 million for emotional distress.

Question: “How do you define "Free Will" and "Determinism," and why do you think Free Will is superior? If Free Will means that a person could have chosen to do something different than what he did, given the same past and laws of nature, then it's difficult for me to believe Free Will is true because I don't understand how that is possible.

Watching the pretend moral hysteria erupting after a group of Marxist-motivated, George Soros-funded Bernie Sanders supporters shut down a Donald Trump rally in Chicago by threatening and committing crimes against peaceful Donald Trump supporters is truly a gruesome spectacle that sets stage for an ever-escalating cycle of violence – unless it is interrupted, exposed, and thoroughly repudiated.

That is my job, and that is your job as well. Do not fail civilization, do not fail reason, do not fail peace, do not fail the future.

Do not fail yourself.

Question: “I am a 27-year-old in love. The girl I love is into polyamory and has a hard time sticking to one guy. She is only 21 and is therefore younger than me. I refuse to degrade myself as a man and as her elder by ending up as "just another guy". The logical, experienced side of me says she is a "no go", but I have a hard time restraining my emotions and desires. Should I confess my true feelings to this young woman, or should I walk away with dignity and "go my own way" until either she is older and more mature, or until an opportunity presents itself to enrapture her? Or should I write her off altogether as toxic?”

I believe that in order for any meaningful change to happen, regardless of what that change might be, that change will have to be done using force, since women are the majority of the voting population, and I simply don't see women voluntarily voting for a system that limits their influence on politics and on society at large." 

"Is human nature fixed, specifically female nature (in terms of hypergamy), and will the only way to make any meaningful change is to implement an Islamic-style Patriarchy, making women the lawful property of men?”

"Today’s children are bombarded with many dangers with terrorism and global warming being the big two. How is this affecting our future generations? Is creating a fatalist generation?"

On December 2nd, 2015, the San Bernardino terrorist attack involving Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik brought significant attention to the federal government’s inability to screen immigrants, refugees and visa applicants. 

The lessons of this attack - which left 14 people dead and 22 others seriously injured - were lost on many government officials who continued their push for the United States intake of refugees and impossible to vet immigrants. 

Over two months later, the terrorist attack has brought attention to the issue of privacy, security and government surveillance. Apple is currently involved in two separate legal cases with government agencies concerning compliance with the All Writs Act and extracting information from various iPhones and operating systems.

Tim Cook released a detailed statement about the situation – and all the political candidates including: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump have taken public positions. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has even gone as far as to suggest a boycott of Apple products until Apple complies with the court order backing the FBI’s request.

I am trying to determine why my focus and thinking during this high stress encounter was not in regard to my safety or my property, but rather my potential incarceration and loss of rights."

"My thoughts raced around being arrested, being stripped of my ‘rights’, being called a racist (god-forbid the perp had slightly darker skin than I), trial by media, being incarcerated indefinitely, or some politician using my flight as an evil tool. Why is my reaction to a potential life threatening home invasion completely political? Have I become programmed? While I should have been thinking about exits, number of assailants, the wrought the perp was taking, I was thinking about corrupt politicians and the propaganda machine. Why do disgusting political possibilities trump the potential for loss of life in the mind of me, the victim?”

Title: The Death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia | True News
Date: 2016-02-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=TuFO7VYy4qs
Description: Antonin Scalia was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan, and was the longest-serving justice on the court, having taken his seat on Sept. 26, 1986. Justice Scalia is famous for his application of constitutional originalism and opposition to “legislating from the bench.”

"The Constitution that I interpret and apply is not living but dead, or as I prefer to call it, enduring. It means today not what current society, much less the court, thinks it ought to mean, but what it meant when it was adopted." – Judge Antonin Scalia

Justice Scalia was discovered dead on February 13th, 2016 in Texas - and conspiracy theories spread as many pondered the massive impact his absence could have on the future United States. 

What kind of impact will this have on upcoming Supreme Court cases? Will President Barack Obama be able to appoint a new Supreme Court Justice in the remainder of his presidential term? This presidential election just became more consequential – as now it’s a fight for the soul of America.

Question: “I represent a recently established classical liberal party in Norway called the "Capitalist Party". We've managed to mobilize a rapidly growing and diverse party of freedom-oriented people. Our consistent growth as a young party is unprecedented here in Norway. What value, if any, do you recognize in utilizing channels within the political system to proliferate rational ideas and classical liberalism?"

If this is okay, then how is restricting immigration compatible with property rights unless one takes the conclusion that the state owns the country and so can decide who enters it or not?"

Question: “I live in Cologne, Germany. The events on New Years eve kept me pretty upset. I moved here with my wife and kids to raise my little daughter in peace and security."

"As a libertarian, I was always aware of what was going on, but the last 12 months completely changed the country I used to know. However, if I decide to leave this country, where should I go? Besides the fact that it will be very hard to convince my wife to leave her family and friends behind, you must understand that Germans tend to be very attached to the place they live. It is not easy to move your whole life, especially after you settled with a house and kids." 

"Furthermore, I think I remember you arguing for libertarians not to “run” but to stay where they are and try to better the society where they live. How do you achieve that when this place going to hell in a handbasket?”

The Republican Presidential Debate in South Carolina was filled with fireworks and many newsworthy moments - but the fallout has been even bigger! During a back and forth with Jeb Bush, Donald Trump had strong words regarding George W. Bush's previous claims that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Now - Trump has issued Ted Cruz an ultimatum: apologize and retract your lies about my positions, or I'll take you to court over your presidential illegibility. 

Is Marco Rubio a robot? Did Donald Trump make Jeb Bush cry during the debate? Did George W. Bush lie about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? Is Ben Carson awake? Has Ted Cruz lied about Donald Trump's positions and engaged in other unethical behavior? Is John Kasich even aware he's running for president?

Title: Unions Headed for Supreme Court Loss? | Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association
Date: 2016-02-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Md0zHMm8vII
Description: The Center for Individual Rights is representing Rebecca Friedrichs and nine other California teachers in a lawsuit against the California Teachers Association - arguing that forced union association and dues payments are illegal. The case has made it all the way to the United States Supreme Court.

Lead plaintiff Rebecca Friedrichs has taught for twenty-six years and says, “the union has become what it used to fight - a powerful, entrenched organization more focused on self-preservation than educating children and protecting teachers.”

The CTA has used millions of dollars in compulsory dues to become one of the most powerful political organizations in the state of California - promoting issues with which many teachers fundamentally disagree which highlights the compelled speech inherent in mandatory union membership of any kind.

Stefan Molyneux speaks with plaintiff Rebecca Friedrichs and lawyer Terence J. Pell about the nature of the Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association case, the likelihood of victory, the consequences of forced association and what this means for government unions nationwide!

Terence J. Pell is President of the Center for Individual Rights: https://www.cir-usa.org

Note: This interview was recorded prior to the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and many news outlets have speculated that this case would be "immediately affected" by his passing.

Description: MP3: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3201/why-liberals-are-wrong-about-inequality-bill-whittle-and-stefan-molyneux

The pursuit of truth can never be biased or prejudiced. Are you aware of the differences in intelligence between various groups? Are you aware of the predictive capacity of general intelligence factor related to income, poverty, crime, health and many other life outcomes? Why aren't differences in Intelligence part of the outcome equality discussion?

Bill Whittle joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss the third rail of modern politics, the dangers of not understanding human differences, why output equality is overlooked, what the science says about differences in Intelligence and the preservation of western civilization.

Has Hillary Clinton's campaign imploded? What happened in Iowa with Ted Cruz and the Ben Carson speculation? Is Marco Rubio a cyborg programmed with talking points? Why is Eminent Domain suddenly such a massive topic? Why are the establishment candidates failing in both parties?

An estimated 1.5 million people have been infected during the recent Zika Virus Outbreak in Brazil. First discovered in 1947, the Zika Virus made its way to South America, Central America and the Caribbean for the first time in 2015. 

With possible links to Guillain-Barré syndrome, Microcephaly and other devastating birth defects – fears around the spread of Zika have grown in recent weeks and scary news headlines reflect growing concern. From conspiracy theories around Genetically Modified Mosquitoes to demands for increased research and investment into a Zika Virus vaccine – the reactions have been rapid and startling.

Question: “I consider myself a scientific thinker, and like to dabble in some philosophy, I have also worked hard to maintain my Christian faith while doing this (an effort which most of my colleagues have seemed to abandon for one reason or another)."

"I'm looking to challenge myself by talking to you. The scope of the conversation, I would prefer to revolve around the question "how can someone be both logical and a Christian" as this question seems to come up in my day to day life to whomever is unlucky enough to ask me; but if we divert, we divert. In what ways does having a Christian faith preclude a person from being scientifically minded?”

"I would rather be in control of my money, in control of my life (to whatever degree), and give the proverbial middle finger to the state (whilst handing over my tax penalty with my free hand.

Question: “What do you think of the Nurse with a Purse phenomenon? It is true that ‘hot girls’ sometimes show up at the doors of beta males once they have become “used up” by the alphas. But another funny thing happens many years later in a man’s life cycle."

"A typical scenario my girlfriends and I see, is that the man invests in his prime, in the hottest girl, not necessarily the one with the best values, and when a man gets old he realizes that the hot girl took everything he had and he is broke and alone. He tries to woo women in their 40s or 50s, the same types he rejected for the hot girl who took all his resources, because these women now have a home, money and sometimes nursing or care taking experience. Guess what happens to these old men. The same thing.”

Conflicting information over what happened after Robert ‘LaVoy’ Finicum, a well-known member of the Oregon Rancher Standoff group, died in a shooting involving federal agents. In a statement, Ammon Bundy described Finicum as his "beloved friend" and one of "the greatest men and greatest patriots." 

At a press conference, federal and local law enforcement officials placed responsibility for the confrontation with the occupiers. FBI Special Agent Greg Bretzing blamed the “actions and choices of the armed occupiers” for the situation, commenting that “actions are not without consequences.”

Eight members of the Oregon Rancher Standoff were arrested on Tuesday and charged with “conspiracy to impede officers of the US from discharging official duties through the use of force, intimidation or threats.” Three more men were arrested on Wednesday night after Ammon Bundy released a statement urging protesters to leave the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.

Senator Ted Cruz is a leading Republican candidate for President of the United States in 2016. 

As a graduate of both Princeton University and Harvard Law School, Cruz has an extensive background in constitutional law - previously working for the United States Department of Justice and as Texas Solicitor General. Cruz also served as a domestic policy adviser to President George W. Bush and was an adjunct professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin - teaching U.S. Supreme Court litigation.

The son of a Cuban refugee who fled persecution and belonging to a family brought back together through religion - Cruz ran for Senate as part of the Tea Party movement, threatening to fight back against the Washington Cartel, Wall Street corruption and banks that were too big to fail.

As Cruz battled Donald Trump and Marco Rubio for support, he’s faced several controversies around Presidential eligibility, Immigration, Syrian Refugees, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and undisclosed loans from both Goldman Sachs and Citibank.

Politics can be a dirty game - but what is the Truth About Ted Cruz?

Question: “Ten years ago, I had an epiphany and realized the God is real. After some searching, I lucked into the Catholic Church. My whole world view changed and expanded. I have come to realize that the Catholic world view makes a lot more sense than the Atheist world view."

"In watching your videos, I see that you are an Atheist and you also refer to yourself as a moral philosopher. I have also heard you use terms like “virtue” and “evil,” which I normally associate with Theology. I have also heard you be somewhat snarky and dismissive of the views of believers."

"What homework have you done to explore the Catholic world view? Why do you feel the Atheist world view is superior? On what basis do you derive your moral code?”

National Review contributors recently joined together in criticizing Donald Trump and his candidacy for President of the United States. Stefan Molyneux responds to David Boaz's contribution to the National Review's "Conservatives Against Trump." David Boaz is the executive vice president of the Cato Institute and the author of The Libertarian Mind.

“A lot of Americans think it would be better to have a businessman than a politician as president, and I sympathize with them. Alas, the only businessmen crazy enough to run for president seem to be, well, crazy. At least Ross Perot kept his craziness confined mostly to private matters, such as the looming disruption of his daughter’s wedding. Donald Trump puts it front and center….”

“In a country with more than 300 million people, it is remarkable how obsessed the media have become with just one — Donald Trump. What is even more remarkable is that, after seven years of repeated disasters, both domestically and internationally, under a glib egomaniac in the White House, so many potential voters are turning to another glib egomaniac to be his successor….”

Question: “You assert that the redistribution of wealth and/or transfer of property rights from the bourgeoisie (owning class) to the proletariat (The working class) necessarily uses forces in violation of the non-aggression principle, but doesn't the exploitation of labor by the owner do much of the same thing, or at minimum have the same effect. Could one claim that the working class expropriation of the means of production be considered self-defense under the non-aggression principle?”

As a multi-million-dollar civil lawsuit was underway against the Manitowoc County, Wisconsin police department – Avery was arrested and charged with the murder of Teresa Halbach, a local photographer.

You can't listen to a presidential debate without hearing about ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act. Even if you don’t follow the news, it’s hard to go for more than a few days without hearing someone mention their insurance premiums, high cost of care, or some other frustration with health care.

Stefan Molyneux speaks with Dr. Jeffrey A. Singer about the state of healthcare in the United States, the dangers brought about by government regulation, the downside of electronic medical records and what things look like "on the ground" in the medical profession.

Dr. Jeffrey A. Singer is an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and a general surgeon in private practice in metropolitan Phoenix, AZ. He is principal and founder of Valley Surgical Clinics, Ltd., the largest and oldest group private surgical practice in Arizona. He was integrally involved in the creation and passage of the Arizona Health Care Freedom Act, and serves as treasurer of the US Health Freedom Coalition, which promotes state constitutional protections of freedom of choice in health care decisions.

The cure for hypocrisy is exposure - and lo, there cometh particular times in human history when a hidden hypocrisy overreaches itself, and becomes at last so blindingly obvious that even idiots cannot stay blind to it – and then, it falls – or will, at least, if there are a few people with courage enough to push over its rotten and rotting structure.

Here and now is where I step forward to do just that.

Question: "The subject I would like to cover with Stefan, is the topic of being a morally consistent Voluntaryism while, at the same time, supporting the current immigration policies that Stefan is in support of, in respect to Syrian and Muslim immigrants. 

I do not necessarily disagree with Stefan but I am having a hard time seeing how I could defend such a policy from the Anarcho-Capitalist, morally consistent position. I have therefore, not committed fully to either side. What I wish to get out of the call, is a conclusion to this that I can explain, once and for all that falls in line with my Libertarian beliefs."

Fireworks, celebration and sexual assault. New Year’s Eve in Cologne, Germany was marred by over 1,000 migrants launching fireworks into crowds and a shocking amount of sexual assaults and rapes. One woman described being groped over 100 times during a 200-meter walk and many man and women were unable to escape their attackers. Stefan Molyneux is pissed off about the Germany Rape Attacks.

Title: US Federal Government vs Oregon Ranchers: Cruel and Unusual Punishments

Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3168-us-federal-government-vs-oregon-ranchers-cruel-and-unusual-punishments

In 2010, the United States of America charged Oregon Ranchers Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven Hammond with Arson for:

1) Setting a government pre-approved “prescribed burn” fire which spread to 139 acres of unoccupied state land – actually raising its value according to Bureau of Land Management reports. Nobody was hurt, damages at the time were under $100 and the Hammonds extinguished the fire themselves without outside assistance.

2) Setting an unapproved “back burn” fire to save their property from a lightning-related range fire. Given their ignorance to the fact the Hammond property would be threatened by an act of God, the ranchers did not receive prior government authorization and a “burn ban” was in effect. The ranch was saved, but one acre of government land was impacted – again raising its value, according to BLM reports. 

The Hammonds openly admitted to both incidents and thus the jury found them guilty of those charges, dismissing others. To avoid continued deliberations on unresolved charges, a plea deal was reached with the state. 

The Government requested a five-year mandatory minimum sentence in accordance with the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Judge Hogan thought using a terrorism related statute in the case would be improper and would violate the Eight Amendment, constituting cruel or unusual punishment. 

Dwight was sentenced to three months in prison and Steven to twelve months and one day – which they both served. While they were in prison, the Government filed an appeal to the sentence with the Ninth Circuit Court and received the mandatory minimum they originally requested. 

On Monday January 4th, The Hammonds surrendered themselves to continue their unconstitutional five-year mandatory minimum sentences.

While most of us were exchanging Christmas gifts and celebrating the start of a new year, Oregon Ranchers Dwight Hammond, Jr., 73, and his son, Steven Hammond, 46, were preparing for a return to prison on January 4th, 2016.

Among other things, the Hammonds were charged with various counts of Arson on federal property – punishable by a five-year mandatory minimum sentence according to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. 

On January 2nd, an estimated 300 Hammond family supporters – including Ammon Bundy, son of Cliven Bundy – held a peaceful protest against what they called the unconstitutional treatment of the ranchers.

While the peaceful protest continued, Ammon Bundy and other armed individuals left, entering and occupying the Bureau of Land Management’s Malheur Wildlife Refuge headquarters, which had been closed for the holiday.

Following the occupation, Ammon Bundy said the refuge’s creation was “an unconstitutional act,” and called for the release of the Hammonds and for the federal government to relinquish control of the area. 

“This is about the federal government controlling the land and resources, and putting whole counties and whole states in economic duress, this is about violations of human rights, about the federal government not even caring about what is in the Constitution.”

In our politically correct society, an honest discussion about crime and the causes of criminality is often prevented by emotional hysteria. What are the indicators and predictors of criminality? Is crime simply a natural byproduct of poverty? Does the prevalence of single motherhood impact criminality? Do crime rates differ by race/ethnicity? What does the Warrior Gene - Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) 2R - have to do with criminality and aggression? What is the truth about crime?

Question: "Stefan once wrote "The word “anarchy” may be almost beyond redemption – any attempt to find goodness in it could well be utterly futile – or worse; the philosophical equivalent of the clichéd scene in hospital dramas where the surgeon blindly refuses to give up on a clearly dead patient." 

I am a self-proclaimed racist, and sexist. I am not a bigot, nor a misogynist. I do not blindly follow stereotypes, or engage in blanket prejudices as if they were science. Lastly, I am not a supremacist by any means. 

Race is defined as a group of people sharing the same culture, history, language, etc.; an ethnic group. Sex is defined either of the two main categories (male and female) into which humans and many other living things are divided on the basis of their reproductive functions. Ism is defined as a distinctive practice, system, or philosophy, typically a political ideology or an artistic movement. When we use words such as abolitionism, activism, behaviorism - we do not add a negative connotation to these words. 

Like the word anarchy, I believe the sophists have corrupted the words racism, and sexism. They have lumped numerous definitions into this one word, and have weighed it down. They use racism to mean supremacist, negatively prejudice, stereotype driven, hateful, and misogynistic. 

There are very real differences between race, and sex. Do you agree with my analysis of the words racism, and sexism? If so, do you believe the words can, or even should be rehabilitated? If not, I am curious to where you think I have miss-stepped?"

How we can bridge the gap between liberals and libertarians?"

Question: "What are your thoughts on the work of John Rawls? How do his central ideas compare to yours? Which of his ideas do you agree with the most? And which do you agree with the least? Are his ideas on justice compatible in any way with a free society? Overall, do you feel that John Rawls helped or hurt the field of philosophy?"

Title: The Federal Reserve: There Will Be No Economic Recovery.

On October 19th, 2014, the Federal Reserve ceased the third round of quantitative easing (QE3) and all but promised to raise the interest rate by the end of 2015. It was widely speculated that an increase in the interest rate would occur in September, but the month came and went without change. 

It was reported that the Federal Reserve wanted to see more improvement in the economy before raising the key interest rate. Despite approximately $3.5 trillion worth of asset purchases since 2007 and the unprecedented and prolonged decrease of the Effective Federal Funds Rate to a historical low - effectively 0% - the economy had yet to recover enough to warrant a rate increase. 

With their “the economy is recovering, we promise” credibility on the line, the Federal Reserve increased the interest rate 0.25% on December 16th - effectively adjusting it in name only and leaving it at historic lows. This didn’t stop the mainstream media from proclaiming the "dawning of a new era,” announcing an end to “an era of easy money that helped save the nation from another Great Depression."

There Will Be No Economic Recovery. Prepare Yourself Accordingly.

“Star Wars” occupies an epic and unique place in the pantheon of youthful fantasies, and the recent reboot by JJ Abrams deepens and extends the glowing mayhem and radical anti-family message of the original series.

The original Star Wars emerged during a time of catastrophic family breakdown in the West – the divorce rate had risen 300% from the 1960s to the 1970s – leaving hundreds of millions of boys without fathers. Luke Skywalker’s multi-movie quest to find and save his father mirrors the search for masculinity which has obsessed and crippled entire generations of young men.

Question: "I am a clinical scientist who works in a government funded hospital laboratory. Having worked here for sometime, I have concluded that the current model for funding and completing research only breeds fraud and is a waste of resources. 

This is not incredibly surprising considering this is generally the case for government funded "anything" but what I have found depressing is the degree to which my colleagues, whom I consider intelligent individuals, vehemently reject this conclusion irrespective of the fact that the evidence is near incontrovertible. 

What bothers me more is the disconnect between public perception of scientists (ie: Objectivists in search of the truth to promote societal good) and the personalities I am surrounded by on a daily basis who are willing to make monumental logical leaps, cut corners, and distort reality just so long as they can be published.

I enjoy my profession (in the technical sense), but watching dishonest people lauded as saviors, and showered with government grants has sapped my motivation. What is Stefan's view of government research? 

Is it worth being a part of a system that is laden with so much fraud? Does it make me immoral for taking money through taxation from the unassuming public to pay for my salary? Does the current system simply need to be abolished?"

Donald Trump's proposal to shut down Muslim immigration until the government fixes its vetting process sparked remarkable, though predictable, outrage across the globe. One of the most common criticisms is that such a ban is unconstitutional. Stefan Molyneux examines the legality of Trump's proposal and addresses other criticisms that have been hurled at the United States presidential candidate.

The mainstream media is in a frenzy over Donald Trump's proposal to restrict Muslim immigration into the United States - and the outrage crosses party lines.

Statement from the Trump Campaign: "Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on. According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. 

Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing "25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad" and 51% of those polled, "agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah." Shariah authorizes such atrocities as murder against non-believers who won't convert, beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women.

Mr. Trump stated, "Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America Great Again."

Question: "College and social media has become rife with propaganda that seeks to rally an uneducated youth to dismantle society as we know it. It seems that the vast majority of people my age are so incredibly indoctrinated that they simply will not listen to reason. They resist reason as if it is counter to their very survival. Is it too late to reason with these people? If it is not too late, how do we break through to these people? If it is too late, how do we get the world back?"

Question: "To what extent do patterns in nature exist? Do patterns of nature exist outside the mind? Based on these patterns in nature, I propose that it's possible to control unforeseen negative experiences - like getting struck by lightning - by coordinating one's preferences to coincide with the preferences of nature. 

In this vein, I propose it's rational and optimal for people to meditate over crystals and getting involved in mysticism such as astrology and tarot cards, because it helps humans learn natures archetypes and natural law. Please save me from this irrationality, if that's the case!"

Title: Pathological Altruism | Barbara Oakley and Stefan Molyneux
Date: 2015-12-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=sqIYznUlwtA
Description: MP3: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3156/pathological-altruism-barbara-oakley-and-stefan-molyneux
Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3156-pathological-altruism-barbara-oakley-and-stefan-molyneux

The benefits of altruism and empathy are obvious. These qualities are so highly regarded and embedded in both secular and religious societies that it seems almost heretical to suggest they can cause harm. Like most good things, however, altruism can be distorted or taken to an unhealthy extreme. 

Pathological Altruism presents a number of new, thought-provoking theses that explore a range of hurtful effects of altruism and empathy.

Stefan Molyneux and Barbara Oakley discuss the concept of Pathological Altruism, the biological science behind it, the unfortunate implications of wanting to feel like you’re doing good opposed to actually doing good, the failure of modern science, the non-reproducibility of may scientific studies, bias in academia and much much more!

Barbara Oakley, PhD, PE, is a professor of engineering at Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, and writer of national acclaim. Her research focuses on the complex relationship between neuroscience and social behavior. Dr. Oakley’s research has been described as “revolutionary” in the Wall Street Journal—she has published in outlets as varied as the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and The New York Times.

The San Bernardino County Public Health Department held their annual holiday gathering at the Inland Regional Center on Wednesday. The party ended with 14 people shot dead and 21 injured in the latest terrorist attack – this time on American soil. 

California health inspector Syed Rizwan Farook and his Saudi Arabian wife Tashfeen Malik were involved in the shooting/terrorist attack and were later killed during a shootout with Police. As police continued to look for a third suspect, thousands of rounds of ammunition, 12 pipe bombs and hundreds of tools that "could be used to construct IEDs or pipe bombs” were found in the couples’ home. 

As President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and the mainstream media cling to their false narrative of “workplace violence,” it was confirmed that Farook had contact with a suspected terrorist under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

What is truth about the San Bernardino California Shooting and Terrorist Attack?

Were the Crusades an unprovoked act of aggression on behalf of bloodthirsty Christians? Did the First Crusade mark the beginning of close to a millennium of hostility between Christianity and Islam, or did the conflict begin centuries earlier? 

Stefan Molyneux takes a closer look at the historical background of the Crusades and presents shocking information that is often hidden from the general population. What is the truth about the origins of the Crusades?

In other words, what if the only way we can organize large groups of people (in a stable way) is to install a central government with all the taxes, laws and police?"

On the heels of the Paris Terrorist Attack and new ISIS threats against the United States, the American people are beginning to ask questions about the intake of Syrian refugees. 

The United States is currently taking in 10,000 Syrian refugees and President Barack Obama has commented about taking in 100,000 refugees total (not just from Syria) in each of the next two years.

The Governors of 31 U.S. States are refusing to take any additional refugees from Syria – and others are demanding additional information on the efficacy of any screening procedures. 

On November 19th, the U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation requiring new screening of Middle Eastern refugees. President Barack Obama threatened to veto the legislation, but the 289-137 vote - including 47 Democrats - is enough to override any veto attempt and these concerns cross party lines.

Reports show 129 people are dead, 352 injured and 99 of the injured are in critical condition after the Terrorist attacks in Paris, France on Friday November 13th, 2015. 

Three coordinated teams of Islamic Terrorists - some with AK-47s, some acting as suicide bombers - attacked seven sites throughout the French capital with the worst carnage occurring at the Bataclan concert hall, with at least 89 left dead.

ISIS released a statement on Saturday November 14th, claiming responsibility for the attacks. 

French President Francois Hollande has closed the borders due to the “unprecedented terror attacks” and has vowed that France will wage "merciless" war on ISIS in response. 

France remains under a nationwide state of emergency.

The Paris Terrorist Attack was the second deadliest on a Western city since 9/11 - the worst since the Madrid train bombings in 2004 where 191 were killed.

Stefan Molyneux is pissed off and makes an impassioned plea to save Western civilization before it's too late!

Ben Carson overcame a very difficult upbringing to become a gifted neurosurgeon famous for pioneering life-saving brain surgery techniques and for leading a team of seventy people to separate conjoined twins. 

Carson is currently battling Donald Trump at the top of the polls for the Republican presidential nomination. As of late the mainstream media has questioned the truth of Carson’s backstory – raising some legitimate questions but also smearing him with nonsensical falsehoods.

Stefan Molyneux speaks to Dr. Linda Gottfredson about the differences in human intelligence, the gap in established knowledge between academia and the general public, the difference between general intelligence factor and IQ, disputing the Flynn Effect, the work of J. Phillip Rushton and the challenges of pursuing politically incorrect research. 

Dr. Linda Gottfredson is a professor of education and affiliated faculty in the University Undergraduate Honors Program at the University of Delaware. She currently serves on the editorial board of the journal Intelligence and is President of the International Society for Intelligence Research. She has been elected Fellow of three scientific societies (American Psychological Association, Association for Psychological Science, and Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology) and won awards for her research (American Psychological Association, International Society for the Study of Individual Differences, Mensa Research Foundation), science writing (Mensa Press Award), “extraordinary leadership and service” (UD Faculty Senate), and “courageous public defense of student and faculty rights” (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education).

Who is responsible for the current economic situation in the United States of America? Was the housing crash and banking sector meltdown the result of deregulation and the dangers of free market capitalism? Is government regulation and interference in the market to blame for all these problems? 

Stefan Molyneux and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts debate these issues and more in a discussion about Dr. Roberts’ recent book “The Failure of Free Market Capitalism.”

Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy under Ronald Regan and is a former associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. Dr. Roberts is the author of "The Failure of Laissez Faire Capitalism" which you can order at: http://www.fdrurl.com/FailureCapitalism

Question: "Given all of the momentum towards a collectivist and leftist society, what makes you believe that philosophy can turn the momentum around? Might the more effective method of turning society around be to withdraw and give the leftists exactly what they want, and to wait for the inevitable collapse that will follow as a result of their policies? Basically Atlas Shrugged."

"You have said yourself that crazy today has to always be given an out, and people won't face rationality until they have no other options. Wouldn't giving in be the fastest way to make them face reality, rather than prolonging the process by trying to convince then with evidence?"

Stefan Molyneux responds to Bill Gates recent comments asserting that the government is more efficient than the private sector.

“Yes, the government will be somewhat inept,” Gates said. “But the private sector is in general inept. How many companies do venture capitalists invest in that go poorly? By far most of them.”

For many decades, two main reproductive strategies have been recognized by biologists - this is referred to as r/K Selection Theory. When you look at humanity through the lens of reproduction strategies – things quickly begin snapping into place and a battle for survival is revealed. 

In the area of public discourse, these two survival strategies battle for ultimate supremacy. Bill Whittle joins Stefan Molyneux to discuss the various political positions and attitudes – including how they are shaped and explained through r/K Selection Theory.

As the Federal Government braced itself for a possible shutdown due to approaching the debt ceiling limit - John Boehner and Washington political class found another way to stick it to the American people.

The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 was passed by both the House and the Senate this week and will result in at least $85 billion in spending increases over the next three fiscal years. Most importantly it will suspend the current $18.1 trillion debt limit through March 15th, 2017. 

This essentially gives President Barack Obama a blank check for future spending and removes lawmakers constitutional power to control borrowing of the federal government. Hey Founding Fathers! You wanted checks and balances - well too damn bad! We got some votes to buy!

Stefan Molyneux responds to YouTube comment criticism of his “Why I Was Wrong About Socialism” video.

0:12 - "I think being Libertarian is something like being a hermit type person, who is living on his own desert island where everything is up to that person, who can do what they want because they are on their own. They can build their own society anyway they want it to be. They can survive or die, achieve or fail, but ultimately they are on their own. I think in the perfect Libertarian society there could be other people, but every person would have their own desert island."

4:13 - "It's very obviously easy to reject self ownership. "Owning your own body and owning the effects." Ego is an illusion and choices are made by biological, deterministic processes. Your entire worldview is fucked to the point where you deny any conclusions that don't depend on some your view of the importance of agency."

7:51 - "The fundamental difference between a factory and a toothbrush is the collective benefit you dimwit. You keep saying you can't create artificial distinctions, but here you are claiming a priori that property rights and personal responsibility is and ought to be more important than consequentialism. How is that not subjective? The hypocrisy and low brow philosophizing on this channel is just pathetic to watch. That's why it's a youtube show."

12:51 - "The earth being the center of the universe is not necessarily false. It is only a model. 2+3=4 can be proven false. You can not prove or disprove any central point of orientation in the universe. But I will agree that the earth being the center is a more complicated model to ingest."

13:49 - "SM always has two things he mindlessly bangs on that makes his "freedomain" radio such a farce. 1) government is evil, but he never analyses what government is and what other forces are relative to government, how it could change ... the whole discussion and idea is juvenile and superficial. 2) collectivism and socialism, communism whatever. Again, superficial sloganeering He talks about freedom with the real intent being to support powerful private interests which will take your freedom away when government is not there to be influenced by you. Every one of his talks and videos suffers from these propagandistic themes."

Title: 62% of Illegal Immigrant Households on Welfare | Steven Camarota and Stefan Molyneux

According to a recent study by the Center for Immigration Studies, 62% of households headed by a illegal immigrant participated in at least one welfare program in 2012, compared to 49% of legal immigrant-headed households and 30% of native-headed households. Stefan Molyneux speaks with Dr. Steven Camarota to clarify what this data means and to debunk the common myths and non-arguments concerning illegal and legal immigrant welfare usage in the United States. 

Dr. Steven Camarota serves as the Director of Research for the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a Washington, DC based research institute that examines the consequences of legal and illegal immigration on the United States. 

In recent years Dr. Camarota has testified before Congress more than any other non-government expert on the economic and fiscal impact of immigration. In addition, he was the lead researcher on a contract with the Census Bureau examining the quality of immigrant data in the American Community Survey.

Title: What Pisses Me Off About Justin Trudeau and the Canadian Elections

So I felt a strange reluctance to work on Canadian electoral politics over the 78 day political Iditarod mad race to the frozen power centers of the far north. It's not so much that Canadian politics are boring, more that, without nearly as much of the constant race-baiting that occurs in American politics, the political strategies up here are just so relentlessly predictable.

For those outside of Canada, there are three major parties – the until-recently oxymoronically-named Progressive Conservatives, the semi-Marxist New Democratic Party, and the Liberals, who are willing to take on whatever shape they need to in order to sneak-pick the marble doors of power.

Politics is so unsightly because it is so false. This gruesome parade of selfish self-deception is repulsive to observe. Unless your idea of a good time is to go to a seedy bar and watch all the drunks pompously denying their addictions, it's best to keep a safe distance from this contagion.

Canada is a pretty nice place to live, all things considered. Every few years there is an orgy of wild lying and false promises, which is necessary to survive the self-destructive system we have all inherited - at least for those who don't want to consider real change - but we can live well, and tend our crops, despite this intermittent swarm of superficial brain locusts that always arrive hungry, and always leave empty.

Question: "I’m skeptical of anyone who says with absolute certainty that A is directly responsible for B. There are far too many variables to say for certain whether spanking a child for their misbehavior impacts the child adversely. Correlation does not equal causation. Just as one should be skeptical of the “wage gap” between men and women, etc. Advocating something because you believe it can be admirable, but using flawed studies and statistics doesn’t make you right.

Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3105-the-truth-about-immigration-and-welfare

One of the most controversial questions in the discussion of both legal and illegal immigrants has been around their consumption of welfare. A recent independently verified report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) has answered that question - and the results are incredibly shocking. 

The report by Dr. Steven Camarota titled “Welfare Use by Immigrant and Native Households” which analyzed welfare usage using the Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data. 

The major welfare programs covered in this report include Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Women Infants and Children food program (WIC), free or subsidized school lunch, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - more commonly known as food stamps, and public housing or rent subsidies.

What is the truth about Immigrants and welfare usage? What does this mean for the future of the United States of America?

The topic of Immigration - including Illegal Immigrants, Refugees or Migrants – provokes an incredibly strong reaction from many different people. With Donald Trumps’ rapid rise in American politics and his controversial statements about Illegal Immigrants - many people are letting their ideology trump facts, reason and evidence. This presentation is the first in a series which looks to dispel the myths about Immigrants – and aims to separate the facts from the fiction with strict data analysis. 

Why are people so concerned about Immigration in the United States of America? Who is coming into the United States both legally and illegally - and how has it changed over time? Are Illegal Immigrants able to vote? How do Immigrants impact electoral politics? Do Immigrants favor big government or smaller government? How do their political positions change over time - are Immigrants friends of freedom?

Stefan Molyneux is pissed off - and he communicates a very important message about rejecting feelings of guilt and shame from those without empathy. Guilt is often a big red button that bad people push to extract resources from good people. Don't be exploited, don't be guilted or shamed into exploitation.

In virtually every sport in which they are given opportunity to compete, people of African descent dominate. East Africans own every distance running record. Professional sports in the Americas are dominated by men and women of West African descent. Why have blacks come to dominate sports? Are they somehow physically better? And why are we so uncomfortable when we discuss this?

The nature versus nurture debate is one of the oldest and more fiercely debated issues within science. So what exactly is the nature versus nurture debate all about? Do genetic or environmental factors have a greater influence on your behavior? Do inherited traits or life experiences play a greater role in shaping your personality? Dr. Nancy Segal and Stefan Molyneux discuss the reality of the nature vs. nurture debate, the genetic heritability of Intelligence (IQ), personality, sexual orientation and what we have learned from twins studies in this areas. 

Dr. Nancy Segal is the Professor of Psychology at California State University, and Director of the Twin Studies Center. She is the author of many books including, Born Together-Reared Apart: The Landmark Minnesota Twin Study. For more, go to: http://drnancysegaltwins.org

Title: Another Terrorist Attack? Spencer Stone Stabbed! | True News

Early Thursday morning at approximately 12:45 am, an altercation in Sacramento, California led to a man being stabbed multiple times in the torso. The victim was out with four friends, one male and three females, and had a run-in with two or three men according to the Sacramento Police Department.

Why are we talking about this? Because one of the last times the victim was out with friends he thwarted a terrorist attack. The victim is Spencer Stone, one of the three Americans (the others being Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler) who stopped a suspected terror attack while aboard a train in France this August.

Considering that this stabbing comes days after the Umpqua Community College shooting in Roseburg, Oregon makes this even more suspicious. Alek Skarlatos had previously attended and already re-enrolled in classes at the college and had he not agreed to compete on “Dancing With the Stars” he would have been on campus the day of the shooting - “I had classes picked out and everything.”

Is this just a massive coincidence? Maybe so - but the certainty from the Sacramento Police Department despite limited information is completely absurd.

Title: More Criticism: The Truth About Bernie Sanders

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=keJL-boLZkM
Description: Some interesting responses to the recent "The Truth About Bernie Sanders" video - and the important elements many Sanders supporters seem to be missing - like sentence structure and correct spelling.

Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. Sanders spent 16 years as Vermont’s sole congressman in the House of Representatives before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006. 

Sanders has amassed considerable grassroots support relative to democratic frontrunner Hilary Clinton and is incredibly popular for his opposition to income inequality. 

Promising to fight for a “progressive economic agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment and provides health care for all,” the Senator is a formidable candidate in the democratic presidential primary.

Title: How to Think Critically | Fighting Against Propaganda

Question: "Most of the time it feels like thinking, but if I'm really honest, most of what I say 'I think' is some combination of other thinkers that I've read or listened to or watched. Maybe this is normal but a problem arises when two different people, whose opinions I value, come to conflicting conclusions. This painfully reveals to me how much of a hidden desire that I have for someone to just 'believe in.' Why is thinking for myself so hard?"

Title: The Death of Europe | European Migrant Crisis

Question: "Do the ongoing Gene Wars (see the r/K Selection presentations for more on this) invalidate the Non-Aggression Principle? The Non-Aggression Principle doesn't work if it's not universal and it's not universal because there are sub species of humans in heavy opposition. We are not all the same so why should the rules be extended across gene sets?"

The European migrant crisis arose through the rising number of migrant arrivals seeking asylum – a combination of economic migrants and refugees – to the European Union (EU) across the Mediterranean Sea and the Balkans from Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany expected over 800,000 asylum seekers to come this year - over four times more than in 2014. European Union member states agreed in July to take in more than 32,000 migrants to “ease the burden” on Italy and Greece, where the largest numbers have arrived. Another eight-thousand should be allocated by the end of the year, according to the European Union's commissioner for migration.

Title: What Pisses Me Off About The Oregon Shooting and Chris Mercer-Harper

Description: MP3 Download: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3089/what-pisses-me-off-about-the-oregon-shooting-and-chris-mercerharper

On Thursday October 1st, 2015, 26-year-old Chris Mercer-Harper entered Umpqua Community College in Oregon - wearing body armor and armed with five handguns and an assault rifle - and murdered nine people in cold blood, leaving at least nine more injured and destroying the lives of countless families.

Following the shooting Barack Obama and the political establishment wasted little time in calling for increased gun control - willfully unaware that these gun free zones are a magnet for violence regardless of weapon availability. Stefan Molyneux is pissed off – and breaks down the facts while deconstructing the usual media narrative and focusing a spotlight on the true root of this problem.

Jason Richwine has a Ph.D. in Public Policy from Harvard University and is an analyst and contributor writer for National Review.

Title: Was mich an der Europ?chen Fl?ngskrise ?ert
Date: 2015-10-01

Description: Die europäische Migrationskrise entstand durch die steigende Anzahl an Migranten – einer Kombination aus Wirtschaftsmigranten und Flüchtlingen - die aus dem Mittelmeerraum, dem Balkan, aus Afrika, dem Nahen Osten und Südasien in der Europäischen Union (EU) Asyl suchen.

Die Deutsche Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel sagte, dass in diesem Jahr 800.000 Asylsuchende nach Deutschland kommen werden. Fast viermal so viele wie 2014. Mitgliedsstaaten der Europäischen Union haben im Juli zugestimmt, mehr als 32.000 Migranten aufzunehmen, um die Last von Griechenland und Italien zu teilen, dort, wo die meisten Migranten ankommen. Weitere 8000 sollen laut dem Migrationsbeauftragten der Europäischen Union bis zum Ende des Jahres aufgenommen werden.

Stefan Molyneux ärgert sich und informiert Euch über die Europäische Migrationskrise.

It is my opinion that that conservatives try to persuade people with logic and reason more than emotions. Besides a few exceptions, I think a majority conservative personas can participate in rational discussions without constant logical errors or appeal to emotions. So - why do not we play the left's game? Why do we persist with logic when the left wins by making emotionally arguments?

Destroying the world is actually lot easier than you might think – you will have to be patient, of course, but remember this: evil delayed is evil denied, and it is well worth the wait.

To destroy the world, you need to do three things – first: break the bond between husband and wife – second: break the bond between parent and child – and third: convince the population that they are helpless.

Title: Why Europe Owes The Migrants Nothing

Description: MP3 Download: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3081/why-europe-owes-the-migrants-nothing

One of the great “gotchas” of history is currently sprinting through our collective consciousness with regards to the migrant crisis in the European Union, and it goes something like this:

“The migrant crisis is payback for Western destabilization of Middle Eastern governments – if you don't want these refugees, you shouldn't have bombed their countries – Karma is a bitch, so suck it up!”

This is an emotionally compelling argument for many people – and here is where we need to exercise the greatest caution. Emotionally compelling arguments by their very definition need to be rigidly examined and resisted – to avoid intellectual bigotry, we must subject seductive arguments to the greatest tests.

Question: "Certain common sense conservative beliefs are the glue that bonds Republicans nationwide - but are any of these actually principles? Could you address a few of these “beliefs” and tell me if they are actually principles? Includes an extensive conversation on stripping personal responsibility from the black community." This question leads into a deep discussion about the arrest and incarceration rates of black males - and why the narrative of outright racism simply does not hold up to serious scrutiny.

Question: "I’m a German citizen. Is there a solution to the Immigrant crisis in Germany/Europe - or is history repeating itself and we are on the brink of a new European war?"

The European migrant crisis arose through the rising number of migrant arrivals seeking asylum – a combination of economic migrants and refugees – to the European Union (EU) across the Mediterranean Sea and the Balkans from Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany expected over 800,000 asylum seekers to come this year - over four times more than in 2014. European Union member states agreed in July to take in more than 32,000 migrants to “ease the burden” on Italy and Greece, where the largest numbers have arrived. Another eight-thousand should be allocated by the end of the year, according to the European Union's commissioner for migration.

In continuing our discussion on Human Intelligence and the predictive powers of IQ, Charles Murray joins the broadcast to discuss the latest science regarding ethnic and gender differences in intelligence. 

Charles Murray is a political scientist, author, and libertarian. He first came to national attention in 1984 with the publication of "Losing Ground," which has been credited as the intellectual foundation for the Welfare Reform Act of 1996. His 1994 New York Times bestseller, "The Bell Curve," coauthored with the late Richard J. Herrnstein, sparked heated controversy for its analysis of the role of IQ in shaping America's class structure.

Comedian Nicole Arbour caused an uproar when she recently published the video, "Dear Fat People," on YouTube. Other YouTube commentators have made emotional response videos decrying Arbour for "Fat Shaming" and "Body Shaming," while others created emotional response videos calling Arbour a bully. Stefan Molyneux responds to the controversy to look at the facts behind obesity, fat shaming and the reaction.

"Have you ever noticed that when some people set a goal for themselves, they also create obstacles to make themselves fail? And they do this, I think, because deep down they really don't want to achieve their goal and all the responsibility that comes along with it. I think it's because it's easier, and perhaps more gratifying, to have tried and failed, therefore earning the right to complain about how fate is to blame for their own misfortunes. This is essentially how fear of success manifests itself, I think. Would you agree, and if so, why do you think humans do this?"

For many decades, two main reproductive strategies have been recognized by biologists - this is referred to as r/K Selection Theory. When you look at humanity through the lens of reproduction strategies – things quickly begin snapping into place and a battle for genetic survival is revealed. 

In the area of public discourse, these two survival strategies battle for ultimate supremacy. In the latest installment of the controversial Gene Wars series, Stefan Molyneux analyses various political positions and attitudes – including how they are shaped and explained through r/K Selection Theory.

Title: Kim Davis Jailed Over Gay Marriage Licenses | True News

Description: MP3 Download: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3068/kim-davis-jailed-over-gay-marriage-licenses-true-news

Rowan, Kentucky County Clerk Kim Davis was jailed on Thursday as she continued to defy a court order that she begin issuing gay marriage licenses. Davis was called before U.S. District Judge David Bunning for a contempt of court hearing where Bunning said that Davis would be jailed until she complied with his order to begin issuing gay marriage licenses.

The crux of the contempt case against her involves Kentucky law, which, unlike some states' laws, requires county clerks to issue marriage licenses.

“Her good faith belief is simply not a viable defense,” Bunning said in court, explaining that he did not believe that fines would stop Davis from refusing to grant gay marriage licenses as she makes $80,000 per year as a government county clerk.

Davis testified how she came to Christ in 2011 following the death of her mother-in-law. Before she appeared in court Thursday, Davis said that she was prepared to go to jail.

“I’ve weighed the cost and I’m prepared to go to jail, I sure am,” she said. “This has never been a gay or lesbian issue for me. This is about upholding the word of God.”

Question 2: Do the Baby Boomers and Generation X owe it to the young to accept decreases in their government services in order to provide student debt relief for the young? Put more simply, given how much they have screwed us, don't they owe us?

In a nationally represented sample it was found that 65% of boys were spanked compared to 58% of girls. There is also a gender related difference between the boys and girls who received corporal punishment. Not only were boys more likely to be hit, they are also hit far more often than girls. Mothers have also been shown to spank more than fathers. In a self-reported survey, 64% of Mothers admitted to spanking in the previous 12 months, compared to 58% of Fathers.

Vester Lee Flanagan, known professionally as Bryce Williams, was identified as the suspect in the on-air shooting that left WDBJ-TV journalists Alison Parker and Adam Ward dead in Roanoke, Virginia.

The horrific on-air shooting has drawn comparisons to the Dylann Roof and the Charleston church shooting after excerpts from Flanagan's manifesto cited it as his motivation. Despite Flanagan's history of racially charged interactions and him stating that he desired to further the "race war" the media's reaction has been interesting. 

Stefan Molyneux is pissed off about Bryce Williams and The Virginia Shooting.

Description: MP3 Download: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3066/the-truth-about-south-africa-and-apartheid

The mere mention of South Africa in a discussion provokes deep images of institutional racism, discrimination and horrific violence. An in-depth look at the controversial history of South Africa, Stefan Molyneux separates the fact from fiction and discusses: the communist history of South Africa, the South African Frontier Wars, the Suppression of Communism Act, the Bantu, population growth, racial demographics, catastrophic economic decisions, the devaluation of the S.A. Rand, rampant price inflation, affirmative action, family structure, one of the worst education systems in the world, unemployment, Eskom’s rolling power outages, white flight, rising criminality, an astronomical murder rate, horrific rape statistics, the rampant sexual abuse of children, prevalence of HIV/AIDS, white farmer genocide, police corruption, President Jacob Zuma, the “kill the Boer” song, life expectancy, road fatalities and the untold history of Apartheid.

As the financial markets plunge, many are desperately waiting to see if the Federal Reserve and Janet Yellen will decline to raise the Federal Funds Interest Rate from its current 0-0.25%. In light of the volatility shown by the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other economic indicators, Wall Street yearns for more quantitative easing in the form of QE4.

Peter Schiff and Stefan Molyneux discuss the latest news in the United States and global economy, including: the Chinese currency devaluation, fall of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index, mountains of debt, the Dollar compared to the Euro, the plunge in the price of Oil, Bernie Sanders popularity, Gold, Jon Stewart formerly of The Daily Show, minimum wage absurdity, the hatred of the rich and the economic future of the United States.

Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 1,000 points, its worst weekly performance in approximately four years. On Monday, the index plunged by over 1,000 points early - and closed the day down 588 points. In terms of the number of points lost, Monday August 24th, 2015 was the eighth-worst single-day loss in the index’s history.

A third of S&P 500 companies have declined over 20% from their peaks and many retain high valuations despite disappointing earnings numbers. The United States Dollar Index dropped the most it has in over 5 months today to seven month lows - losing against the Euro and Yen. Oil prices plunged, with the U.S. oil benchmark settling down 5.5% at $38.24 a barrel, its first close below $40 a barrel since February 2009. 

Some analysis are blaming the China currency devaluation and the drop in the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index – but what is really going on?

Title: Should You Vote For Donald Trump?

"In the spirit conjured through your podcast "An Atheist Apologizes to Christians", I have asked myself to evaluate the value of specific institutions that have evolved throughout Western history and have concluded that humanity has a bad habit of throwing the "baby out with the bathwater." Those qualities of Western culture, the institutions that grew, the wealth that we enjoy today relative to the past, evolved from Enlightenment ideals and a protestant work ethic. 

Today's Conservative party holds late 19th century capitalism and 1950's home life as the gold standard and pinnacle from which we have descended. Assuming of course that a politician actually aspires to do what they say they are going to do. 

Why not ride a political wave back to the previous state of affairs that marked those times, and then work towards positive moral change going from there. 

It would seem to be a much easier task than trying to convince an ever growing "r" selected population to think logically. After all, Martin Luther was able to change Christianity for the good without destroying the institution, why can't we? It sounds crazy, but let's vote Republican!"

Title: Rise of the Left, Death of the Family | Phyllis Schlafly and Stefan Molyneux

Description: MP3 Download: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3056/rise-of-the-left-death-of-the-family-a-conversation-with-phyllis-schlafly

In the last hundred years, the American family has been attacked, debased, maligned, slandered, and vilified by every facet of society. No family is safe from the official busybodies. 'Who Killed the American Family' reveals the concerted assault on the American nuclear family by many forces - feminists, judges, lawmakers, psychologists, school districts, college professors, politicians offering incentives and seeking votes, and more - opposed to the traditional American nuclear family, each with its own raison d'etre for wanting to abolish it. 

The wreckage of the American family leaves us with the inability to have limited government because government steps in to perform tasks formerly done by the nuclear family. 

Veteran conservative activist and thought leader Phyllis Schlafly explains how changes in the law, in court decisions, in the culture, in education, and in entertainment have eroded the once-precious institution.

Title: Donald Trump’s Immigration Plan: An Honest Conversation

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=j-pX5UesvXA
Description: MP3 Download: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3052/donald-trumps-immigration-plan-an-honest-conversation

Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump recently released his official immigration plan - and both Republicans and Democrats alike have very strong opinions about the proposal. Based around three core ideas, Trumps plan says: 1. A nation without borders is not a nation. 2. A nation without laws is not a nation. 3. A nation that does not serve its own citizens is not a nation.

Stefan Molyneux and the Freedomain Radio team discuss the origin of the immigration issue, what is really at stake for Republicans, number of illegal immigrants in the country, the big business opposition to immigration reform, the 1965 Hart-Celler Act sponsored by Senator Edward Kennedy, immigrant crime statistics, the mainstream media reaction, H-1B visas, birthright citizenship, cultural voting patterns and much much more!

What will Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie, John Kasich, Rick Perry and the rest of the presidential candidates say about Trump’s immigration policy?

Stefan addresses some of the responses to his recent "The Truth About Bernie Sanders" video - and the important facts many Sanders supporters seem to be missing. 

Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. Sanders spent 16 years as Vermont’s sole congressman in the House of Representatives before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006. 

Sanders has amassed considerable grassroots support relative to democratic frontrunner Hilary Clinton and is incredibly popular for his opposition to income inequality. 

Promising to fight for a “progressive economic agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment and provides health care for all,” the Senator is a formidable candidate in the democratic presidential primary.

In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson declared an “unconditional war on poverty in America” - not simply to “relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it.” How has that worked out? Today there are over 126 Federal antipoverty programs and in constant dollars, Federal spending has risen from $107 billion to $688 billion – or 640%.

Total government spending has ballooned to $21,000 for every person below the poverty level in America, or $63,339 for a family of three. Since the war on poverty began, $19 trillion dollars have been spent ending poverty, but the poverty rate has increased. What is the Truth About Welfare?

Description: MP3 Download: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3042/15-reasons-to-date-a-single-mom-rebutted

Recently an eHarmony article discussed the top 15 Reasons to Date a Single Mom. Stefan Molyneux goes through the the list - and well - disagrees.

0:27 - She’s no wimp. Single moms are tough and independent.

1:43 - She’s already a great mom. (And weren’t you looking for someone who would be a great mother? Look no further!)

5:32 - She’s incredibly patient, but doesn’t have a lot of tolerance for bad behavior. She’ll be good for you.

6:27 - She doesn’t play games. She doesn’t have time to just fool around. She takes her relationships seriously.

7:17 - She’ll only keep you around if the relationship is a good thing for both her and her kids. You won’t have to guess if she’s into you.

7:52 - Single moms are easy to pamper. (They don’t get breaks very often. Hint, hint.)

9:15 - She’s loyal — and is fiercely protective of her little brood.

9:40 - She can articulate what she wants and needs from a relationship.

11:37 - Single moms are both practical and fun. There’s no room for diva behavior.

13:20 - She’s no longer a party girl, but a fun night out is still very welcome.

14:46 - She’s selfless. Single moms put others’ needs before their own.

16:26 - You’ll get to take part in adventures to amusement parks, the zoo and the park. Bonus: You’ll have an excuse to play with toys.

17:15 - She’s adaptable. She knows that life doesn’t always go as planned and has learned how to make the best of it.

17:50 - Single moms can do it all, but are super-appreciative of a helping hand. Woo her with kindness and acts of service.

Title: The Great Depression Myth | YouTube Comments - Rebutted!
Date: 2015-08-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=wtvxQUc7IIs
Description: Stefan Molyneux responds to an assertion about the Chinese stock market, what caused the Great Depression and how it ended.

"Absolutely bullshit! The reason why the Great Depression was so bad was because Herbert Hoover implemented austerity. In fact, the Great Depression was fixed by massive state expenditures. It was named WWII. By the way, what caused the Great Depression? Huge amounts of PRIVATE debt. Funny that Stefan wouldn't tell you this."

Bernie Sanders is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States. Sanders spent 16 years as Vermont’s sole congressman in the House of Representatives before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006. 

Sanders has amassed considerable grassroots support relative to democratic frontrunner Hilary Clinton and is incredibly popular for his opposition to income inequality. 

Promising to fight for a “progressive economic agenda that creates jobs, raises wages, protects the environment and provides health care for all,” the Senator is a formidable candidate in the democratic presidential primary.

Title: An Honest Conversation About Donald Trump

Description: MP3 Download: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3040/an-honest-conversation-about-donald-trump

In the verge of the first debate amongst the Republican Presidential candidates, Donald Trump has a decisive lead - in both state and nationwide polls - over Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and the rest of the prospective nominees. 

Singlehandedly bringing the topic of Illegal Immigration to the forefront of the national debate - Trump has been in the crosshairs of the established political class and the mainstream media. Being called everything from a racist to a rapist in recent weeks since announcing his candidacy, Trump has divided republicans, libertarians and independents, sparking a massive debate. 

Love him or hate him, the ten billion dollar man doesn’t seem to be going anywhere and Trump’s entry into the political fray has certainly shaken things up. Stefan Molyneux and the Freedomain Radio team discuss the prospects of a Donald Trump presidential run, the possible pros, the cons, the effectiveness of political action, the impact of voting vs. not voting and what Trump’s unexpected surge in popularity means for the United States as a whole.

Title: The Fall of Chicago. There Will Be No Economic Recovery.
Date: 2015-07-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=BB6h9R0I-aM
Description: MP3 Download: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3036/the-fall-of-chicago-there-will-be-no-economic-recovery

Under a near crippling amount of debt and unfunded liabilities, Chicago lawmakers recently moved towards pension reform - but were denied by the courts who deemed the reforms to be in violation of the Illinois constitution.

On May 12nd, 2015, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Chicago’s credit rating once again, which means that in less than two years Chicago’s credit rating has dropped seven notches under the rating agency. Moody’s also announced major downgrades for the Chicago Board of Education and the Chicago Park District debt - reducing the bonds to junk levels. 

On July, 28th, 2015, Fitch Ratings followed by downgrading the Chicago Board of Education’s credit rating and also noted a negative outlook for the CPS which means that further downgrades are likely in the future.

Chicago joins Detroit in the illusive group of major cities with junk bond ratings from major institutions, which carries with it incredibly serious financial repercussions and increases the costs of borrowing.

The difference between the two cities is that Chicago’s debt and unfunded liabilities are more than three times higher than Detroit’s were when the city declared bankruptcy in 2013. 

Chicago is unable to restructure its debt because the state does not allow municipalities to go bankrupt. 

To put things in perspective: Every Chicago household is currently on the hook for at least $63,800 in local-government debt.

If things couldn’t possibly get any worse, the threat of another teachers strike is looming over the Chicago Public Schools with the expiration of the teachers’ union contract. Negotiations have not gone well. 

Welcome to Chicago. There Will Be No Economic Recovery.

Title: Scandinavian Socialism: Dangers of the Welfare State
Date: 2015-08-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=D0hnA341AWE

Many have long praised Scandinavian countries for their high levels of welfare provision and for their economic and social outcomes. It is, indeed, true that they are successful by most reasonable measures.

However, Scandinavia’s success story predated the welfare state. Furthermore, Sweden began to fall behind as the state grew rapidly from the 1960s. Between 1870 and 1936, Sweden enjoyed the highest growth rate in the industrialized world. However, between 1936 and 2008, the growth rate was only 13th out of 28 industrialized nations. Between 1975 and the mid-1990s, Sweden dropped from being the 4th richest nation in the world to the 13th richest nation in the world.

Many analyses of Scandinavian countries conflate correlation with causality. It is very clear that many of the desirable features of Scandinavian societies, such as low income inequality, low levels of poverty and high levels of economic growth, predated the development of the welfare state. It is equally clear that high levels of trust also predated the era of high government spending and taxation. All these indicators began to deteriorate after the expansion of the Scandinavian welfare states and the increase in taxes necessary to fund it.

Dr. Nima Sanandaji holds a PhD from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and is the author of “Scandinavian Unexceptionalism: Culture, Markets and the Failure of Third Way Socialism” which is available for free online via the Institute of Economic Affairs: http://www.iea.org.uk/publications/research/scandinavian-unexceptionalism-culture-markets-and-the-failure-of-third-way-soc

Title: The Death of Reason: Why People Don't Listen to Reason and Evidence
Date: 2015-08-21

Description: MP3 Download: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3055/the-death-of-reason-why-people-dont-listen-to-reason-and-evidence

All living organisms depend upon their accurate perception of reality to survive and reproduce. If a gazelle fails to identify a predator, it will get eaten. For a lion, a mistimed lunge may be the difference between a full belly and death through starvation, or even broken bones from a zebra’s kick. Human beings lack the sharp nails and teeth of lions or the speed of gazelles, yet we posses the most powerful – and dangerous – tool within the animal kingdom – our minds. We would therefore expect the human brain to be highly capable of accurately analyzing and conceptualizing the world around us.

The process of reasoning invariably involves the use of logic, and logic itself is derived from the immutable properties of the physical world. Empiricism is another component of reason that depends upon the accurate perception of reality.

Reason is thus incredibly valuable to us, but what if reason itself gets in the way of our survival and reproductive success?

Title: 5 Questions Libertarians Can't Answer - Answered!
Date: 2015-07-27

Description: 0:00 - Is very limited government the same on a moral level as very large government? On a moral level, is it the same to steal one penny as it is to steal $100,000?

16:10 - One argument I always hear when talking about taxes, etc, is that it is "part of living in a society”. What is the best way to answer that?

22:35 - When talking about the free market/entitlement programs, multiple arguments come from the “other side” that I would like to hear his argument against. First, “how will people survive without a social safety net?

32:13 - Should every business be able to deny service to anyone they want? People usually go insane when I say that businesses should be allowed to. The argument I often hear is that it is “more immoral” to refuse service to someone for sex, race, sexual orientation, etc. than it is to make those business owners serve them.

44:37 - One last thing- what are your thoughts on the New Deal from FDR? Throughout public school, I was taught over and over and conditioned to believe that the New Deal was what saved the US from the Great Depression, but I have come to think otherwise.

One week after Planned Parenthood was rocked by video-taped discussions of the harvesting and "sale" of aborted baby body parts for research purposes - a controversial new video has been released. 

In the new video, which was obtained by the Center for Medical Progress, another top official with Planned Parenthood is on camera haggling over the prices of aborted baby parts and discussing the method of abortion used in order to harvest organs.

What isn’t the media telling you about this story? What isn’t Planned Parenthood telling you?

Western civilization is on a path to destruction. In coming decades, economies will shrink, democracy will retreat and nations crumble. The long-term result will be grinding poverty, superstition and disease. 

This isn't scaremongering it is science. In Biohistory: The Decline and Fall of the West, Dr. Jim Penman, PhD, details a revolutionary new theory about why civilizations collapse. For the first time, Penman directly links human biology with the rise and fall of civilizations a cataclysmic relationship that brought the Romans, the ancient Greeks and all other Empires to their knees. 

Is it already too late to change the course of history?

Dr. Jim Penman is the author of the Biohistory and Biohistory: Decline and Fall of the West which explains a revolutionary theory about the physiological underpinnings of social change and its probable effects on civilizations. Dr. Penman is also the owner and full-time CEO of Jim's Group, which is the largest franchise in Australia with over 3000 franchises. For more go to: http://www.biohistory.org

Unless you’ve lived under a rock, you’ve heard about the impact Donald Trump is having on American Politics. After controversial comments about illegal immigration and crime, Trump has risen to the very top of the polls, making him the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for the Presidential Election. 

After a very successful campaign event in Phoenix, John McCain called Trump supporters “crazies,” which lead to a public war of words between the two figures. Recently, Trumps comments about McCain’s status as a war hero have been punched on by the mainstream media and Republican political establishment. Now I want to tell you what pisses me off about Donald Trump and John McCain!

Description: When debt consumes a country and its financial system collapses - who will pay? Who will be held responsible for the bad decisions, the debt and the malinvestment? 

Throughout history, it is typically the young who are sacrificed for the sake of the older generation; young people are herded into the buzz saw of war and have their futures sold off through massive debts long before they escape the crib. As financial collapse looms above several major world economies - who will be held responsible when the bill comes due?

China just lost over $3 trillion of stock value, what this means to you, your house, your money, your future and your chances for true economic and political freedom.

After more than doubling in value over the last year despite a slowing economy and weak corporate earnings reports - the stock market in China is in a freefall. While the eyes of the world are on Greece and the European Union – China’s economy is imploding.

Since June 12th, 2015, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index has fallen 31.2% - wiping out over $3.2 trillion USD of the markets total value - and there seems to be no immediate end to the market plunge in sight. There Will Be No Economic Recovery. Prepare Yourself Accordingly.

Puerto Rico’s economy is in a death spiral and it could threaten the entire United States bond market. How did we get to this point and what does this mean in the big picture? 

Stefan Molyneux breaks down the unspoken facts about the end of freedom, opportunity, employment and trade in modern Puerto Rico. An in depth explanation about what this means for the average Puerto Rican and Americans overall – spoiler, it’s not good!

“My administration is doing everything not to default,” Governor Alejandro García Padilla said. “But we have to make the economy grow,” he added. “If not, we will be in a death spiral.”

There will be no economic recovery, prepare yourself accordingly.

Title: The Dangers of Being a Social Progress Parasite
Date: 2015-06-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NKAevgGvqjw
Description: Stefan Molyneux answers a listener question by making a passionate rant against being a social progress parasite. 

Question: When is a good time to change someone’s mind? We live in a society where I feel that most people don't want to argue with each other - because both sides know that they are not prepared enough or have enough time to convince another person - or are in a too awkward place to argue. Can you balance the coexistence and friendship with arguing and debate?

Title: The Truth About Dylann Roof | Charleston Church Shooting
Date: 2015-06-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=fELRvpvtifU
Description: Nine people are dead after a shooting that occurred on Wednesday at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. The congregation, established in 1816, is one of the oldest African American churches in the United States.

Gunman Dylann Roof told the worshipers, "I have to do it. You rape our women and you’re taking over our country and you have to go."

One woman was specifically spared as Roof said, “I'm not going to shoot you because I want you to tell everyone what happened.” 

Authorities believe that Roof acted alone – but as we’ll soon discuss, no mass murderer truly acts alone.  

Roof has now been charged with nine counts of murder and has reportedly confessed to carrying out the shootings. In discussions with investigators, he said: “I wanted to start a race war, but almost didn’t go through with it because everyone was so nice.”

On Saturday, Dylann Roof’s personal website “The Last Rhodesian” was discovered. The website featured additional photographs and a 2,500-word manifesto which explained his motivations.

What is the truth about Dylann Roof?

Description: Nine people are dead after shooting which occurred 9pm on Wednesday at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. The congregation, established in 1816, is one of the oldest African American churches in the United States.

Gunman Dylann Roof was attending a bible study meeting at the church and told the worshipers, "I have to do it. You rape our women and you’re taking over our country and you have to go."

One woman was specifically spared as Roof said, “I'm not going to shoot you because I want you to tell everyone what happened.” 

Stefan Molyneux examines the news story, what is known about Dylann Roof, how this incident could have been prevented, incomprehensible parenting, false rape statistics, violence in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, the call for gun control, the danger of SSRIs and a plea for an honest conversation about race in America.

Title: Genetic Ostracism | Ideology vs. Reproduction

Description: "I'm currently a resident physician in Emergency Medicine. This profession requires deductive reasoning, a rational approach to problems, and critical thinking to successfully treat patients. However, it has become increasingly clear that a great number of people who share my profession do not seem to follow these aspects of thinking when it comes to issues such as the validity of the State and supporting force against one group to benefit another.

It reminds me of atheists who approach the likely nonexistence of a spiritual being using logical proofs and reasoning but who seem to support other irrational ideas almost on a whim. Why do you think this occurs in people who have devoted their life to something that requires one to be logical and rational?"

Title: The Most Inspiring Story You'll Hear Today!
Date: 2015-06-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=4G5C3KjsNx8
Description: "I was introduced to you four years ago by my eldest son, who, at the time, had been listening to your podcasts for a few months. I am writing you this evening because I think that it is important that you receive feedback to help you understand the profoundly positive effect you are having on this world even if it is not always easy to see. 

This year West Point’s class will graduate. When they entered West Point there were 1.261 members of this class, including my second son. I do not know exactly how many of those 1,261 will be graduating, but I do know that there will be one fewer graduates than there would have been had it not been for you – and my eldest son.

My eldest son was a student at College when he was introduced to you. Shortly after that my younger son, was accepted to West Point. I will always remember the day he received his acceptance package and my feeling of pride in him. It was just about one year earlier that I first found out that he was interested in the military academies. He made his decision to pursue a military path without the thought ever entering my mind. A teammate of his who had gone to the Naval Academy had sparked his interest. He said to me one night that he could get his education paid for and all he had to do was serve his country for five years. And, he said, “There is nothing wrong with that.” My how things can change.

The best thing about the military academies in the United States is that students do not have to officially commit to the military until the first day of classes of their third year. My older son knew this and after his brother had been at West Point for one year he began his all-out effort to convince him that he had to get out. He started sending things to read, and to his credit, my younger son read everything that was sent. It didn’t take long for my youngest son to become convinced that the war in Afghanistan was wrong in so many ways and he knew for sure that unless someone could convince him otherwise, he would never be able to lead troops into that battle.

My younger son then made it his mission to find someone, anyone, in the army’s leadership who could explain to him why we were fighting in Afghanistan. He tried for about six months. No one even tried to justify it. Everyone he spoke to who had actually been in Afghanistan admitted to him that the morale there amongst the troops was horrible, and that no one felt that we were actually making anything better. Some even admitted that we were causing more problems than we were solving.

So as soon as he finished his final exams at the end of his sophomore year he informed the academy that he was leaving. He then made the mistake of honestly filling out the exit forms regarding his top three reasons for leaving. He cited the war in Afghanistan, the military’s use (misuse) of drones, and the Army’s failure to properly address sexual assault in its ranks. 

After taking a year off, my youngest son in back in school and doing quite well. Today, he gets it – as do I. And this is directly a result of his brother finding you. Had you not chosen to do what you are doing I am quite certain that my son would be preparing to graduate from West Point and to embark on a career that would damage himself and others irreparably.

How do I adequately say thank you for that? All I can do right now is say that I am eternally grateful to you for the role you played in this. So for now I will simply say thank you, thank you, thank you."

Title: The 97% Consensus? Global Warming Unmasked!
Date: 2015-06-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=yTTaXqVEGkU
Description: It’s been claimed that ninety-seven percent of scientists agree: climate change is real, man-made and incredibly dangerous. But where does this ninety-seven percent claim come from, and more importantly - is it true?

The claim is taken from a paper by Australian John Cook, Climate Communications Fellow for the Global change Institute at the University of Queensland. However, the paper says nothing about the would-be dangers of climate change and it only counts the number of publications, rather than the number of scientists, in support of human-made climate change. Never let facts get in the way of a good story.

Within Christianity, there were no prohibitions of cousin marriages until a religious council in France banned it a few decades after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Orthodox Christians also enacted a ban on the practice.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage#Judaism_and_Christianity
http://www.consang.net/images/d/dd/01AHBWeb3.pdf

As far back as the 5th century AD, Saint Augustine argued that incestuous relationships diminish social cohesion by promoting family tribalism. 
https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DpbsjpEB28UC&pg=PA62

Jews, on the other hand, never had any bans on cousin marriages. Instead, they adopted the practices of the local dominant culture. Ashkenazi Jews, for example, very rarely married their cousins due to European influences, whereas non-Ashkenazim had relatively high rates of cousin marriages. 
https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xt7f6WBEP0EC&pg=PA229

During the Reformation, the Protestant branches, such as Baptists, Lutherans, and Methodists, rejected the Catholic ban, which is the reason why cousin marriages in the largely-Protestant United States were legal in all states prior to the Civil War.

Title: The TSA's 95 Percent Failure Rate | True News
Date: 2015-06-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=38IetwrqijE
Description: Recently, the Department of Homeland Security decided to test the effectiveness of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) by conducting a series of undercover tests. The results were quite shocking.

Investigators were able to smuggle mock explosive and banned weapons in 67 out of 70 attempts. That's a failure rate of 95 percent!

In one of the tests, for example, an investigator with a fake bomb attached to his back set off an alarm but was allowed to pass through after a pat-down. What if this wasn't a test?

In response to these findings, the TSA acting administrator resigned from his position… Oh wait, he didn't – he was reassigned to another DHS agency.

The Secretary of Homeland Security also promised to conduct training for all TSA agents to address issues revealed by the tests.
Imagine the following scenario…

An independent investigations of Starbucks coffee shops in New York reveals that 67 out of 70 Caramel Macchiatos contain traces of urine. In the fallout of this controversial finding, the head manager of the New York branch is re-assigned to Starbuck's Washington office, and the company's employees are offered extensive training to make sure urine doesn't end up in people's drinks. How would you feel if this actually happened?

The job of TSA agents is to prevent the smuggling of dangerous weapons onboard passenger planes. A randomized test reveals that those agents are incapable of doing their jobs, and as a result, they only receive a slap on the wrist in the form of "training."

In the private sector, employees and their managers would be fired on the spot. TSA's incompetence is, by itself, not that surprising. What is surprising is the way this incompetence is being addressed – or not addressed.

Plus, airport security has killed over 7,000 Americans since 9/11, by reducing air travel and exposing travelers to far more dangerous road conditions. By the way, that’s more than the number of people killed on 9/11. This is the equivalent of four fully loaded Boeing 737s crashing in flames each and every year.

When the government monopolizes a service, it eliminates all competition, and in the absence of external pressure to improve, the internals of government organizations fester and rot. The next time you travel by plane, make sure you hold your nose as you go through airport security. You don't want the smell of decay to ruin your day.

Title: The USA Freedom Act | True News
Date: 2015-06-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=VO_22Gegihg
Description: On June 2, 2015, Obama signed into law the USA Freedom Act, which as an acronym for Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet-collection and Online Monitoring Act. What a delightful name! The USA Freedom Act!

So, what is this new bill all about?

In an attempt to curb NSA's rampant spying activities – particularly when it comes to bulk collection of phone-call metadata such as date, time, call number, device etc. – legislators introduced several "reforms."

Instead of allowing the NSA to collect and store metadata on its own servers, telephone companies will now be required/forced to do that instead. The NSA can still access that data with the permission of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court (FISA court).

This is the same court that, in 33 years, declined only 11 out of 33,900 surveillance requests made by the agency. Perhaps you can already smell the scent of FREEDOM!

Ah, but don't worry! To promote transparency in the decisions of the FISA court, the U.S. government will appoint special overseers that would make sure civil liberties aren't violated in the secret dealings of the court. Government-appointed overseers? Move along, no conflict of interests here! Also, these overseers can technically be blocked from accessing certain documents on the grounds of lacking a security clearance, and the decision to disclose information to the public is still in the hands of the intelligence community. The question of rubber-stamping hasn't been addressed either.

To further limit NSA's reach, the bill requires the agency to submit specific selection terms in its surveillance requests, which exclude broad categories like entire geographical regions or networks. While this technically prevents the NSA from conducting "mass-surveillance," the final decision about what constitutes a valid selection term is up to the court.

While the USA Freedom Act pretends to curb NSA's phone spying activities, it does nothing to address the agency's surveillance of the internet under programs like PRISM, the existence of which was made public by Edward Snowden several years ago.

My American audience can rejoice now that the bill was signed into law. Your freedoms have been restored and future abuses have been made impossible. If you doubt this, just take a look at the name of the bill – the USA Freedom Act. It has "freedom" in it, doesn't it? And to those foolish enough to voice complaints about the bill, let me remind you that those who opposed the Patriot Act were called unpatriotic. You don't want to be anti-freedom now, do you?

On a side note, President Obama will sign the USA Prosperity Act in the near future, which will give a job to every unemployed American, wipe out the national debt and restore U.S. economic prosperity. Well, the Prosperity Act doesn't technically have to do any of that because in the 21st century, words have more weight than actions.

Lastly, if you think that freedom will come in the form of a government law, you are sadly mistaken about the nature of politics. Every law is an opinion with a gun. You comply, or else… If that's what you call freedom, you are already living in a paradise.

Description: "The world is not exactly chock full of people who are voluntarist... who've got self-knowledge, people who've been to therapy, people who have good relationships, people who reject the state and the initiation of force." Nor will it ever be, Stef. Not even close. And therein lies the fundamental flaw in your brand of philosophy. Your ideal society requires for the average human a minimum threshold of intelligence and morality that cannot be met. I find many things you teach very useful on a micro level and they will help many individuals in their quality of life and their relationships, but the debate about extending them to a large enough population to change our societal structure is moot."

Aren't States, at least in the traditional sense of monarchs and limited republics, nothing more than one or a group of human property owners collectivizing their efforts to defend property from natural forces?

Title: Mandated Circumcision? | Georganne Chapin and Stefan Molyneux
Date: 2015-05-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=LB844N3vyKU
Description: After 1?s of fighting against the mutilation, Heather Hironimus was jailed after she fled to protect Chase Nebus-Hironimus from a court order demanding that he be circumcised. Jailed since May 14th for defying a judge's custody order and refusing to let her son be circumcised - Hironimus gave her consent - under duress - to the procedure wanted by the boy's dad, Dennis Nebus.

Heather Hironimus is now charged with interference of custody, a third-degree felony, from her months of hiding with the boy in a local domestic violence shelter.

Stefan Molyneux speaks with Georganne Chapin from Intact America about the trends in circumcision, the myth of its medical necessity, the tragic Heather Hironimus case and what can be done to end this barbaric practice in the world today. 

Georganne Chapin is the founding executive director of Intact America, and founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Hudson Center for Health Equity and Quality. She is a lawyer and also serves as Secretary of Attorneys for the Rights of the Child. For more go to: http://www.intactamerica.org and https://www.facebook.com/intactamerica

Description: I am having trouble finding a definition of property that would explain ownership of finite things that are not products of a person's labor. The definition that I have heard provided by Stefan is "property is something that is created," and I agree with this statement, but I am not sure that it explains how something that was not produced by a person can be exclusively used by that person.

Title: The Truth About George Washington
Date: 2015-05-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vkwZDRB3tZo
Description: George Washington was unanimously elected as the first president of the United States of America after winning the American Revolutionary War as the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army.

Washington was first called "Father of his Country" three years after the beginning of the Revolutionary War – a status he earned not only for his military accomplishments, but also because of the numerous virtues he was perceived to possess as a human being.

But within Washington's impeccable character, one quality stood out the most – a unique immunity to the corrupting effects of power, which stemmed from his selfless nature. "I often say of George Washington that he was one of the few in the whole history of the world who was not carried away by power," stated Robert Frost, "America's great poet-philosopher." 

After overthrowing the tyranny of the British Empire, Americans were unwilling to trust anyone with the power of a central government, yet in George Washington they saw a man who had transcended human fallibility. "Had he lived in the days of idolatry," the Pennsylvania Journal noted in 1777, Washington would have been "worshipped as a god."

How could such a man ever abuse his power, let alone become a tyrant? Furthermore, if men like Washington exist and can be elected into power, perhaps the United States government would never follow in the footsteps of the hated British Empire.
Does the mortal George Washington live up to his immortal legend? What is the Truth About George Washington?

Title: The Truth About David Letterman
Date: 2015-05-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=s_HLHDgQeko
Description: David Letterman has been involved in the entertainment industry for over forty years and tends to be a very divisive figure. Some people loved the affable everyman who caustically poked holes in the facade of celebrity, while others found Letterman to be mean-spirited and aggressive.

What isn’t up for debate is the sizable role he’s played within American culture over the course of multiple decades. Whether you’re a fan or not, everybody knows the name David Letterman and his sarcastic wit has left an imprint on generations of observers.

A deeply private man, Letterman’s relationship with his own celebrity and success is as complicated as it is fascinating. At many points in his career it seemed the only thing Letterman feared more than outright failure were the consequences and pressure of his own achievements.

For a man who often took the wind out of pompous, egotistical celebrities – who dared to take themselves too seriously – Letterman was a workaholic, nearly obsessed with achieving perfection in his performances, and left a trail of broken relationships in his wake.

Subjective opinions abound, but what is The Truth About David Letterman?

Includes: 'The Tonight Show' on NBC,‘ Late Show with David Letterman,’ on CBS, his quintuple bypass, Larry 'Bud' Melman, The Top Ten List, Stupid Pet Tricks, the Comedy Store, The Ed Sullivan Show, Johnny Carson, Merrill Markoe, Jay Leno, Regina Lasko, Michelle Cook, Oprah and much much more.

Title: Baltimore Riots: Police, Freddie Gray and Ambivalence
Date: 2015-05-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=AgSL9g1mpnU
Description: Question: "There are so many hidden agendas in the speech and actions of the different political and non-partisan groups, so many wheels within wheels, the community here in Baltimore is a bit stunned into mental silence. We have met, and discussed, but we are searching for rational courses of action, lines of thought.

For example, I question the Constitutionality of the curfew, but I am at the same time overjoyed at the curfew. I live in a beautiful but noisy section of town (normally lots of fights outside in the middle of the night). I’m surprised at how quickly I stepped off my principles to wallow in the short-term gratification of peace and quiet — and a decrease in the likelihood that there would be more property damage.

I’m definitely in shock. I was stoic about the incredible pressure of school exams while a riot and fires are going on outside my window, but then I find myself suddenly angry, almost to the point of crying or hitting furniture. I second guess myself every day that I should have left."

Date: 2015-05-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0o2eKaELGMY
Description: YouTube Comment: "Okay, there's so much retardness here that I just facepalmed over nd over again since there's a blatant contradiction between communism and nazism a high schooler would understand:

Socialism or communism, whatever leftism you speak of, beleives that all classes and nationalities will unite more or less. Nazism (or rather Hitler because he is he pretty much engineered the most of the ideology and fathered it) thinks that the classes only can be united through VOLKSGEMEINSCHAFT, race-solidarity. Hitler despised communist because he thought that they were weak idealists like democrats and liberals (all in his opinion jew created) because in his mind the aryan race would always be superior to other races, and that races SHOULDN'T UNITE BUT IMPROVE THEMSELVES THROUGH ISOLATION AND RACE WAR, making the race stronger (socialdarwinism). SO you see, "all proletarians unite" was to Hitler just Humbug and pacifism,

I hope your simple minded brain enjoyed this basic lesson on Hitler and his ideas. I used to respect you, however I am increasingly aware tat you're not that bright."

Title: How To Fight Police Brutality!
Date: 2015-05-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=d9vTS9Fc1K0
Description: It is very tempting to spend one’s anger and outrage on particular manifestations of an unjust system – but all that does is pretend that the rest of the system is somehow just.

In magic, this is called “misdirection,” which is the art of drawing the attention of the audience away from the hand actually performing the trick.

In the black magic of politics, this is called “the media.” When you cover the air horn blaring of the media circus, the true constellations of political power become immediately visible.

Listen on and discover how we truly end police brutality!

Title: Sex for Resources | The Most Honest Modern Woman You Will Ever Hear!
Date: 2015-05-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PYslCEH_l4k
Description: Question: What do you think of making it normal, expected and completely above the table, that the husband visits young prostitutes once the wife’s aging starts to show? In effect this would be like outsourcing the part of the relationship which is disappointing to the man (because of her natural aging) so they can avoid the grueling experience of divorce. She could of course get a cat to meet her needs...

Title: The Truth About Freddie Gray
Date: 2015-05-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3j9srEETjd8
Description: On April 19, 2015, Freddie Gray, died as a result of injuries sustained while in the custody of the Baltimore Police Department. He was 25 years old. But the tragedies within this story began much much earlier - and continue, even after his early death. 

As Baltimore burned in the background and protestors rioted - criminal charges were filed against the six police officers who were believed to be involved in his death. 

Will the justice be served in a court of law - or are there more complicated elements involved in this tragic story which need to be addressed? What is the Truth About Freddie Gray?

Date: 2015-04-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=o1xf78EltKM
Description: Single Mothers are talked about in glowing terms for their hard-work, determination and fortitude - but what is the truth about single moms?

Motherhood has evolved quite a bit over the last fifty years: more women are having their children later in life - or in less traditional ways: before and outside marriage. Single motherhood has become so incredibly common that it is projected that soon - half of all children will live with a single mom at some point before the age of eighteen.

What kind of impact does single motherhood have on society? What impact does single motherhood have on children? Are Fathers important - and what impact does growing up in a fatherless home have? What is the Truth About Single Moms?

Title: Pizza War: Gay Discrimination vs. Religious Freedom | True News
Date: 2015-04-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7p5KVVXOJC4
Description: Memories Pizza in Indiana is under heavy criticism after saying that they wouldn’t cater a gay wedding because it was against their Christian religious beliefs. 

Indiana’s Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed the “Religious Freedom Restoration Act” last week with the goal of giving business owners a stronger legal defense if they refuse to serve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender customers on religious grounds. 

Should businesses be forced to serve all potential customers? Should people be allowed to discriminate based on their religious beliefs? Stefan Molyneux, host of Freedomain Radio, takes a look at the Indiana Pizzeria controversy and the discrimination debate.
