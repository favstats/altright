Title: Peter Sutherland's Migration Legacy Punctured: In-Depth Look At The Father of Globalisation
Date: 2018-01-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=l2pIt7ttX34
Description: Henrik takes a detailed look at recently deceased mega globalist Peter Sutherland - one of the most destructive outspoken anti-nationalist and migration advocates - dubbed the father of globalisation. Sutherland's work within the UN was about implementing population replacement in the European countries. He held numerous powerful titles and positions, with for example Goldman Sachs, London School of Economics, the United Nations, Royal Bank of Scotland, the Trilateral Commission and the European Round Table of Industrialists. He was also a Bilderberger and helped to steer the world towards terrorism and chaos in the wake of the War in Syria and the rise of ISIS, with his no-borders approach to refugees and migrants.

Title: Jean-Francois Gari? - Biology of Race: Debunking the "Sceptics" View on Race
Date: 2018-01-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=xXDwbjtmgh4
Description: Jean-Francois Gariépy is an author, academic, and YouTuber from Sainte-Sophie, Québec, Canada. He holds a PhD in Neuroscience from the Université de Montréal, and is currently studying the molecular mechanisms of the origins of DNA-based life on Earth. He has a YouTube channel that is devoted to questions relating to society, gender, biology, neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and internet history. He is the author of the forthcoming book entitled The Revolutionary Phenotype.

We begin the program with Henrik and Jean-Francois discussing the challenges faced by scientists pursuing subjects that are considered taboo by the prevailing politically correct orthodoxy. Jean-Francois states that society has evolved thanks to science, but we live in a current milieu that actively obstructs scientific inquiry. Moreover, we discuss the controversy surrounding a YouTuber, using the alias Kraut, who actively attempted to vilify fellow YouTube personalities with whom he disagreed. Kraut, along with a cadre of like-minded provocateurs, was preparing to prosecute a comprehensive doxing campaign against those he perceived as ideological enemies on the Right. Henrik and Jean-Francois discuss the rationale behind such an aggressive course of action. The radical Left has attempted to silence those on the Right who have employed intelligent, coherent arguments.

The discussion segues to the censorship of YouTube content produced by Jared Taylor, Red Ice Tv, and others because of Leftist smear campaigns and censorious corporate policy. Henrik and Jean-Francois speak to the toxic climate fomented by Leftist moralizing; and the problematic nature of conflating the pursuit of scientific facts with possible moral dilemmas of the future. The conversation then delves into the use of violence, and the arguments made to justify committing violent acts within a context of philosophical disagreement. We go on to address the rhetorical styles employed by Antifa to pillory those on the Right such as attributing false intent. The program also delves into the problem of multiculturalism, Quebec nationalism, demographics, the migrant invasion of Europe from a biological perspective, DNA, RNA, artificial intelligence, the perils of human DNA manipulation, and much more.

Title: Sean SGT Report - Bitcoin & Altcoins Are the Future for Anti-Globalists & Dissidents
Date: 2017-12-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=HwH8870gDWw
Description: Sean is a YouTuber who focuses on economics, finance, and politics.

Sean joins us for an exciting discussion on cryptocurrencies. To begin, he advises the audience to, at the very least, invest a small amount into these burgeoning assets to have skin in the game. Next, we ponder whether cryptocurrencies will enslave humanity or free us from the tyranny of international banking. Sean tells us about how the elite have gained control over precious metals. This, he argues, thankfully cannot happen with cryptocurrencies. Later, we discuss various altcoins – such as Ripple, Ethereum, IOTA, and Cardano – and why their existence is a positive thing. The show covers much more, including why cryptocurrencies have value, the futures market, and how dissident right-wingers are benefiting from all of this.

At the end of the show Henrik gives recommendations for some promising new cryptocurrencies. He also gives some basic advice on wallets – including "cold storage" – and some of the services you'll need to use, like exchanges.

Title: Faith Goldy & Lauren Rose - Dear Cucks, Only One Kind of Nationalism Will Save the West
Date: 2017-12-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=EFPR5bd5ovo
Description: Faith Goldy is a Canadian journalist, who was formerly with Rebel Media. Lauren Rose is an American college student and YouTuber. 

After a few necessary introductions, we begin talking about how Faith and Lauren became nationalists. Faith cites her mother as an important influence, while Lauren explains that living around diversity led her to begin asking questions. Next, we discuss civic nationalism: what it is, and why it’s an issue. Lauren argues that civic nationalism is not real nationalism, for it ignores the realities of race and ethnicity. Later, we talk about the importance of identity, and why IQ shouldn’t be the only factor when considering immigration. The show also explores ethno-nationalism, which Faith argues is still a bit too radical for the masses.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Tlx6YvbXng8
Description: This group discussion includes Ayla (Wife With a Purpose), Bre Faucheux, PhilosophiCat and Kirsten Lauryn.

After taking care of a few introductions, we begin discussing why modern women are marrying much later than in the past. Next, we talk about hostility towards women on the Right, and ponder whether or not misogyny is actually that common in the movement. This leads to a discussion on the notion that Right-wing men are a threat to women – something all of the women disagree with. Later, the ladies take turns explaining why they feel the Right offers women more than the Left. The show also covers the unfolding #MeToo scandals, in which many famous men – predominantly Left-wing – have been accused of sexual misconduct.

Title: The Participation of Police & Military in Multiculturalism - Impivaara
Date: 2017-12-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=O2fSPyPkYDY
Description: This time the discussion deals with the police and the military service and how they relate to multiculturalism and follow the common liberal trend, together with other governmental or non-governmental institutions.

The image of the police and the message they want to convey is more often questioned. The same goes for military service, as they too are adjusting their policies according to minorities. Both the police and the military forces have presented comments and behavior that does not contribute to Finnish citizens or the culture, on the contrary.

During the cultural collision it is profitable to seek the answers from cultural behavior and values. The Scandinavian mindset will provide some data for explaining the tolerant behavior of governmental and non-governmental institutions.

This is the second episode of Impivaara, a Finnish concept that Juhana L will explore in a series for Red Ice TV.

Title: Jay Dyer - How Cult Leader Charles Manson Was Made
Date: 2017-11-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kDGtAZbJ_Bc
Description: Jay Dyer is a public speaker, lecturer, comedian and author of Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film, as well as the host of the JaysAnalysis Podcast/Esoteric Hollywood. He is also a regular contributor to 21stCenturyWire, Soul of the East and the Espionage History Archive. Jay's work covers a wide variety of subjects, including metaphysics, film analysis, theology, geopolitics, literature, and history.

Jay returns to Red Ice for an in-depth discussion about Charles Manson. The program is a detailed contextual examination of one of the world’s most nefarious criminals. Jay and Henrik discuss the cult of personality surrounding Manson not as an isolated phenomenon, but as a product of cultic events in London, the American prison system, Scientology, psychological manipulation, drug use, and the military industrial complex. The conversation ranges from Manson’s own chaotic, dysfunctional upbringing to connections between Hollywood, esoteric cults, and calculated psychological experiments. Henrik and Jay speak to the powerful synergistic effect that these seemingly disparate phenomenon have when harnessed by an establishment bent on affecting social change. The conversation also addresses MK Ultra, Satanism, the ritualistic murder of Sharon Tate, Roman Polanski, Aleister Crowley, Elvis, Anton Szandor LaVey, Kenneth Anger, and much more.

Description: Jay Dyer is a public speaker, lecturer, comedian and author of Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film, as well as the host of the JaysAnalysis Podcast/Esoteric Hollywood.

Jay tells us that we can’t be too surprised, for this type of deviancy has been a defining part of Hollywood for quite some time. We then discuss how the elite use sex to gain control over actors, politicians, and other people of influence. Later, we consider the way the Left has responded to the accusations that have been leveled against Kevin Spacey.

Title: Saudis to Control World's First Artificial Intelligence in Future City Neom
Date: 2017-11-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=c8hXlEeqWzQ
Description: Henrik takes a closer look at Saudi Arabia's new Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Future Investment Initiative that was held in Riyadh recently. Announced was an ambitious project, the creation of a new futuristic mega metropolis driven by Robots and Artificial Intelligence.

Despite warnings, mankind will move forward to build AI but the question is who will control it? Are we ready to hand over control to those that simply can pay for it?

Saudi Arabia's push to "modernize" and move away from extremist Islam appears to be a front. The crown prince is most likely seeking these changes in Saudi Arabia for economic reasons, but also to look good in the eyes of Western liberal and Asian investors, entrepreneurs and creative minds that are eager to bring AI to life and build the future. 

The Saudis want to be at the forefront of Robotics and Biotechnology and with their massive Sovereign Wealth Fund they will be able to attain technology that will give them a massive advantage over many other countries. Should the Saudis and their allies be in control of the most powerful inventions that the world has ever seen? Many brilliant mind have warned that this new emerging technology is something that is MUCH worse than nuclear weapons.

Title: Rose McGowan Shifting Blame from Weinstein to Trump and Men
Date: 2017-10-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=X4lfApFYxCE
Description: Rose McGowan gave a radical feminist speech at the Women's Convention in Detroit this Friday. She went from blaming Weinstein and the environment in Hollywood for the alleged sexual abuse she experienced, to blaming Trump and males in general. She even went so far as to say "[Weinstein] and the big monster (Trump), they need to die." For women like Rose, the blame needs to be shifted from the industry that use and abuse young naive women - with depravities such as the “acting couch” - to holding ALL men responsible.

What's the solution? Listening to Rose and others behind the #MeToo campaign, a new era dominated by women and “minorities” will fix things. A new proletariat melded of the current victim classes will dominate over the patriarchy and the White males that built it. Power needs to be put into the hands of these angry vengeful women, that will end the cycle of abuse.

The Women's Convention in Detroit is a nutty left-wing gathering that is peddling to every perceived victimized group – not only women – in order to gain as much political leverage as possible. The objective is to fight Trump, not to end abuse of women in Hollywood or anywhere else.

Title: Kevin MacDonald - Weinstein's Hollywood, Clinton's Russia Scandal & Hypocritical Liberal Elites
Date: 2017-10-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NiTWh8paqNY
Description: Dr. Kevin MacDonald has a PhD in Biobehavioral Sciences and is an expert on Jewish influence and identity. He is the editor and chief contributor of The Occidental Observer, an online publication that focuses on White identity, White interests, and the culture of the West. Kevin is also the author of numerous books, including The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements.

Kevin returns to Red Ice amidst the Harvey Weinstein scandal to give us an academic perspective on Hollywood and the Jewish obsession with gentile women. We first talk about Weinstein, the producer currently embroiled in a sexual misconduct scandal. Kevin then explains the reasons why the perversions of Harvey Weinstein, Philip Roth, and others are archetypally Jewish.This leads to a discussion on how Hollywood, despite clearly being a den of iniquity, has nevertheless saw fit to lecture Americans on morality for decades. The show covers much more, including the Russian uranium deal, opioid crisis, and Trump administration.

Title: The Harvey Weinstein Scandal Is Why We Need to End the Patriarchy - Operation Reinhard
Date: 2017-10-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZFPLdhh5crg
Description: The Weinstein scandal has led many to wonder how rampant sexual abuse in Hollywood could be allowed to go on for so long. Some have theorized that this is because a certain ethno-religious cabal is running things, but I think that we all know this isn’t the case. 

Instead, the reality is that Hollywood is run by the patriarchy, and it is the patriarchy that is responsible for keeping a lid on this widespread sexual abuse.

Title: Roderick Kaine - Testosterone Rex: Award-Winning Feminist Propaganda
Date: 2017-10-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=DcUBTsENEa0
Description: Roderick Kaine holds a degree in biochemistry and has done professional research in both biology and neuroscience. He is also the author of Smart and SeXy, which explores the biological foundation of cognitive differences between the sexes.

Roderick returns to Red Ice to discuss Testosterone Rex. Written by feminist Cordelia Fine, the book is a biased attempt to dismiss biological differences between the sexes. As Roderick explains, Testosterone Rex is politics first, and science second. Nevertheless, Testosterone Rex won the (once) prestigious Royal Society prize for book science book of the year. We discuss the many ways in which Fine used bad research to attack a complete straw man, and ponder what her motivations might be. The show covers much more, including gender neutral schools, children as political pawns, and the main problems with the modern university system.

Title: Patrick Le Brun - The French Patriot Act: More Power for the Elite
Date: 2017-10-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=B642sjy9qKo
Description: Patrick Le Brun is a writer and activist who has written many articles for Counter-Currents. He has extensive experience with the French Identitarian movement. He is currently based in the United States, where he mentors college students who wish to engage in activism.

Patrick returns to Red Ice to discuss a recent national security bill passed by the French government. Similar to the Patriot Act in America, this bill greatly expands the powers of the French state to fight terrorism. The main issue, as Patrick explains, is that what constitutes terrorism remains ambiguous. Patrick argues that the French ruling elite see nationalism, not radical Islam, as a threat to their interests. Later, we talk about the Islamization of France, and how imams are radicalizing the country’s non-White prison population. The show covers much more, including Patrick’s thoughts on Charlottesville and the American Alt-Right.

Title: Weekend Warrior Ep45 - Infiltration Is The New Normal for Alt-Right & Antifa
Date: 2017-10-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=w4jRIgkiphs
Description: Weekend Warrior is a weekly live show that covers news, entertainment and culture from an Identitarian perspective.

The show opens on the Swede who went “undercover with the Alt-Right” claiming he captured “new and shocking” footage of the true Alt-right. On the flip side, Crowder's producer infiltrated and filmed a small antifa cell plotting violence. Meanwhile in Sweden, The Nordic Resistance Movement marched the streets of Gothenburg in protest of their traitorous politicians while clashing with the police. 

Lana comments on the Harper's Magazine cover story about her claiming that she supports a movement that is hostile to women and other leftist nonsense. Henrik comments on an Amy Goodman video about mass media claiming that communists and immigrants are the media's boogeyman, not Whites.

Also discussed is the Sudanese man in Tennessee who walked into a church and began shooting White people in revenge for Charleston and anti-White hysteria on American campuses. 

Later, Lana talks about an official study using synthetic oxytocin on Caucasian test subjects in order to make them love migrant invaders and in commie California, the Rocklin Academy School board rejected the ability for parents to opt their children out of transgender brainwashing courses.

Description: Blair Cottrell is an Australian political activist, carpenter, and the leader of The United Patriots Front.

Blair joins us to discuss his legal battles, the Islamization of Australia, antifa, and much more. But first, Blair tells us about his background, including how he came to be involved in right-wing politics. Next, we discuss the recent court decision in which Blair was found guilty of “inciting contempt for Muslims.” This leads to a consideration of Islam in Australia, which Blair tells us is growing at an alarming rate. The show explores many other topics, including Australian antifa and Blair’s thoughts on the American Alt-Right.

Later, Matt tells us about his experiences at Unite the Right in Charlottesville, which leads to a discussion on the Left’s proclivity for violence. The show concludes with a consideration of why White identity – something once accepted as healthy and reasonable – has become so profoundly vilified.

Title: Jazzhands McFeels - The End of DACA
Date: 2017-09-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=bZs10KZwv3k
Description: Jazzhands McFeels is the host of Fash the Nation, a popular Alt-Right podcast focused on American politics.

Jazzhands joins us to discuss the Trump administration’s recent decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, otherwise known as DACA. We begin by outlining the history of this controversial program, which Barack Obama instituted via an executive order. Jazzhands then explains how DACA works. Switching gears, we consider the approach Trump has taken to end the program. With a six-month window before DACA ends, we ponder the various ways in which things could play out. The show covers much more, including the BRIDGE act, illegal immigrant criminality, and whether or not it is appropriate to refer to DACA recipients as “dreamers.”

Title: Titus Flavius & Rudolf von Flügel - Aleksandr Dugin, Dinesh D’Souza & Death Positivity
Date: 2017-09-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=krUBeNQFq-E
Description: Titus Flavius and Rudolf von Flügel are contributors to the humorous Tales from the Trough podcast. Titus is also the host of KulturKampf, a podcast that focuses on philosophy and literature.

Titus and Rudolf join us to discuss a number comical stories from the past week. We first go over a recent HuffPost article on Aleksandr Dugin, which claimed that Putin is supporting Identity Evropa. Next, we switch gears from Dugin to another right-wing luminary: Dinesh D’Souza. We poke fun at Dinesh’s awful talking points, and refute the idea that fascism is a left-wing phenomenon. Later, we discuss a recent development in post-modern feminism: the death positive movement. This leads to a discussion on the upcoming, all-female Lord of the Flies remake, which promises to be about as interesting as watching paint dry. The show also explores the various ways in which progressive sentiments are ruining art.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=wUuttxNwB6Y
Description: Kalki Weisthor, otherwise known as Robert, is an Armanist, Wotanist, student of the Vedas, and former attorney.

Robert returns to Red Ice to discuss initiation: what it is, how it’s done, and what forms it comes in. We first outline the differences between right-hand path and left-hand spirituality, and then consider the usefulness of such a dichotomy. Next, we embark on an in-depth exploration of a number of different religious, occult, and spiritual traditions, including Buddhism, Christianity, and Satanism. Later, we discuss various initiatory practices, ranging from astral projection to meditation. Robert relates to us many of his personal experiences, and offers advice to those interested in exploring the farthest reaches of human consciousness. The show explores all of this and much more, including the relevance of certain metaphysical ideas to the ongoing struggle against globalism.

Title: Nick Fuentes - Attacked by the Conservative Establishment for Criticizing Israel
Date: 2017-08-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=bcGeA2hrqrs
Description: Nick Fuentes is a 19-year-old college student, political analyst, and former Right Side Broadcasting employee. He is also the host of the America First podcast.

Nick joins us to talk about the attacks he has suffered – largely at the hands of other right-wingers – for daring to voice controversial opinions. After hearing a little about his background, Nick explains how the Reagan Battalion, Ben Shapiro, and others have – unsuccessfully – tried to destroy him. This leads to a broad discussion on all that is wrong with the conservative movement, including its ahistorical understanding of America and peculiar aversion to “identity politics.” The show covers much more, including Marxist indoctrination in universities, the beliefs of the founding fathers, and the future of right-wing politics in America.

Title: Jared Taylor - AmRen Growing, Rape Gangs in Newcastle and Google Fires James Damore
Date: 2017-08-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3xWix-EK3T4
Description: Jared Taylor is an American journalist, editor of the American Renaissance webzine, and president of the New Century Foundation. His organizations are dedicated to the study of immigration and race relations. Mr. Taylor is the author of several books and scholarly papers, including Paved with Good Intentions, White Identity: Racial Consciousness in the 21st Century, and the forthcoming monograph entitled If We Do Nothing. 

The interview begins with Jared describing this year’s hugely successful American Renaissance (AmRen) conference. He speaks to the Great Awakening of White racial consciousness in the United States and around the world, which has contributed to the immense popularity of AmRen events. Henrik and Jared go on to discuss the increased presence of protesters at the conference, and how that coincided with Donald Trump’s electoral victory. The conversation moves on to the Unite the Right event scheduled for Saturday 12 August 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia. We discuss the threatened removal of the Robert E. Lee statue, the resultant bureaucratic machinations at the municipal level, and the symbolic nature of the gathering. Jared astutely points out that whilst our enemies may be threatening Southern Heritage at present, they will set upon all aspects of White identity before long. Jared also speaks to the universal veneration of Robert E. Lee: he was held in highest esteem on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line. We go on to discuss the potentiality for an expansion of the AmRen event calendar and the different options being considered. Jared goes on to describe that the work at AmRen falls into two categories: race realism and White advocacy. Henrik introduces the subject of Muslim grooming gangs, recent revelations in Newcastle, England, and ongoing revelations about similar events in Rotherham. The discussion turns to similar events in Sweden and Germany, the crisis of European masculinity, and the systematic nature of the Muslim rape Jihad. The first half of the program also features discussions about White racial consciousness and its ability to transcend politics, the rise of nationalist movements, and Jared’s upcoming book.

In the member’s hour Henrik and Jared discuss former Google employee James Damore’s memorandum, which addresses sex differences and so-called diversity initiatives at the giant tech company. Jared states that while Damore’s memo is not directly related to race, it is challenging the prevailing miasma of enforced egalitarianism that suggests sex differences, like race differences, are illusory. This astonishing act of self-hypnosis runs contrary to reality. The scholarly nature of the memo was impressive. Jared marvelled at the deceitfulness of how Damore’s positions were portrayed; this occurs when egalitarian orthodoxy is being punctured. Henrik then broaches the related subject of platform denial, shadow-banning, and censorship of right wing views. Jared agrees that this is a problem and there will be other tactics used against the Alt-Right: “All orthodoxies, as they die, lash out in desperation.” The program ends with a brief assessment of Trump’s performance as president of the United States to date.

Title: Kevin MacDonald - The Importance of Understanding the JQ
Date: 2017-08-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=HyRw2vAKxdI
Description: Dr. Kevin MacDonald has a PhD in Biobehavioral Sciences and is an expert on Jewish influence and identity. He is the editor and chief contributor of The Occidental Observer, an online publication that focuses on White identity, White interests, and the culture of the West. Kevin is also the author of numerous books, including The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements.

Kevin returns to Red Ice to discuss the many ways in which Jewish intellectuals have shaped Western history, culture, and politics. To begin, Kevin tells us about how he came to be an expert on this controversial topic. We then talk about the nature of group interests. Kevin explains that Jews, after arriving in America, correctly noticed that the country favored Whites. This sense of exclusion, he argues, is why Jewish intellectuals have sought to undermine White group solidarity. The first hour touches on many other subjects, including Jewish involvement in communism, mass immigration, and the civil rights movement.

In the members’ hour, we begin by considering divisions within the Western Jewish community. Kevin explains that while Jews might disagree on many issues, there is a large consensus when it comes to immigration, refugees, and the separation between church and state. This leads to a discussion on the abundance of Jewish think tanks, and the need for Whites to have organizations representing their interests. Later, Kevin offers advice for talking about Jewish influence without sounding like a complete lunatic. The members’ hour also covers the prevalence of state-funded, anti-White propaganda, and recent developments in the Trump administration.

Title: Jonas Nilsson - Anarcho-fascism: Nature Reborn
Date: 2017-07-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gWu-k25eCd4
Description: Jonas Nilsson is a political analyst, graduate student, and martial arts expert. He is the author of Anarcho-fascism: Nature Reborn, a book that endeavors to synthesize two seemingly contradictory ideologies.

Jonas joins us to discuss his work, tribalism, Sweden, and much more. First, we talk about his book, Anarcho-fascism, including what inspired him to write it. We then discuss the role tribalism plays in politics, and how the Left is unprepared to deal with ethnic conflict. Later, we consider the future of Sweden. Jonas reminds us that non-Swedes do not constitute a cohesive political unit, meaning native Swedes will retain political dominance for the foreseeable future. The first hour also covers demographics, attempts to integrate ISIS fighters, and the effect geography can have on political philosophy. 

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing violence. Jonas talks about his experience teaching martial arts, explaining that many Swedish men feel compelled to learn self-defense in these troubled times. Switching gears, we ponder how Sweden can be saved from its current predicament. Jonas argues that electing the Sweden Democrats would be a step in the right direction, but ultimately not enough. The members’ hour touches on much more, including the importance of masculinity, the notion of “privilege”, and a few relevant bits of Swedish history.

English version will be available at the end of August.

It's becoming embarrassingly clear that Swedish politics is like kindergarten.

Title: Christoffer Dulny - From Sweden Democrat to Alt-Right: The Metapolitical Struggle
Date: 2017-07-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Um5PwiMIooc
Description: Christoffer Dulny is a political activist and the current editor-in-chief of Nordic.AltRight.com. Christoffer holds a bachelor’s degree in law and was formerly the budget chief for the Sweden Democrats.

Christoffer joins us for an interesting discussion on Swedish politics, the Alt-Right, and much more. First, Christoffer tells us about his background, including his time with the Sweden Democrats and how he came to be involved with the Alt-Right. We then discuss Nordic.AltRight.com, and how a culturally competent Right has caught the Left off guard. Later, Christoffer explains why he supports using globalism against globalism. The first hour concludes with a discussion on the importance of retaining a positive outlook on things.

In the members’ hour, we begin by considering the biggest data leak in Swedish history – a recent event that was entirely avoidable. Next, we mull over the mindset of the average Swedish politician. Christoffer explains that the Swedish government, by not holding politicians liable for their failures, only encourages them to worry about losing reelection. This leads to a broad discussion on the overall state of Swedish politics. The members’ hour covers much more, including the economic burden of multiculturalism, racial differences, and the demographic transformation currently taking place in this once-idyllic nation.

Title: Defend Europa: The Abhorrent Transformation of Britain
Date: 2017-07-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XgIozIeBMJ8
Description: William is a historian and minor political activist. He writes for Defend Europa and has a passion for European politics and the future of our continent in the face of existential crisis. Laura is a nationalist from Yorkshire in England and a writer for Defend Europa. Laura's main interests are population replacement and Islam.

Laura and William join us for a discussion about their website, Defend Europa. In the first hour, we discuss the site’s founding and its recent relaunch. Defend Europa is a website that provides uncensored news coverage of the migrant crisis, Islam, population replacement, heritage, identity, and the establishment elite. The site’s mission is to bring uncensored news to anyone that holds Europe in their heart. In addition to covering these subjects, Laura and William explain that the site is also devoted to the preservation of European culture. The site’s contributors explore the beauty of Europe, history, art, architecture, and philosophy as well. The discussion turns to the lack of honest news coverage in the United Kingdom and how Defend Europa fills a void in an era of increased internet censorship. We discuss the transformation of Britain over the last 30 years, the need to contribute to the information war, generational tensions, and the cultural schisms within British society. 

In the member’s hour the conversation turns to the proliferation of Sharia courts in the UK and the parallel nature of Muslim communities within the country. Laura states that according to outdated 2011 statistics, there are 3 million Muslims in the country that have established no-go zones in Luton, Birmingham, and Bradford which conceal Sharia courts that operate out of shops and mosques. The discussion shifts to the rate of female genital mutilation (FGM), rape, and forced marriage in the Muslim community. William makes the point that police are hamstrung in their efforts to curb these practises in Muslim areas as the spectre of widespread reactive rioting and violence is very real. We then turn our attention to the nature of radicalization, terrorism and the politics of identity in Muslim communities. We also cover the dangers associated with becoming a minority in a formally White-majority country, amidst a culture of White guilt, by using South Africa as an example. The wide-ranging conversation also covers the hypocrisy of the mainstream press, the JQ, Whites in Zimbabwe, and the Manchester bombing.

Title: Hans Lysglimt Johansen - The Alliance: Nationalism and Free Speech in Norway
Date: 2017-07-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=hb4uSGxOJUA
Description: Hans Lysglimt Johansen is a Norwegian entrepreneur and free speech activist, founder of the new Norwegian political party Alliansen (The Alliance). Johansen has a history of work within the libertarian, classical liberal movement. He believes in reviving national identity, national culture as well as pagan spirituality in order to fight back against destructive globalism.

Hans joins us to discuss his political work, current events, and many other important topics. First, Hans tells us about The Alliance. We learn that, while his party is united in its support for free speech, candidates are free to run on their own platforms. Switching gears, we talk about the situation in Europe. Hans argues that the encroachment of Islam – enabled by mass immigration – poses a threat to Europe. Later, we turn our attention to Norway, exploring its demographics, political landscape, and nationalist movement. 

In the members' hour, we begin with an interesting discussion on the benefits of a more interconnected Europe. Hans outlines his vision for the future of Europe, explaining that its current immigration project is inhibiting true social progress. With regard to solving Europe's demographic crisis, Hans recommends removing the incentives – social as welfare and employment prospects – that lure immigrants to Europe. The members' hour explores many other topics, including structural explanations for globalism, political change, and the relevance of ancient European culture to our contemporary struggle.

Title: Elisabeth - European Cooking and Philosophy
Date: 2017-07-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=D_f5_wao3-g
Description: Elisabeth is a YouTuber based in the Netherlands. Her videos delve into traditional European recipes, philosophy, spirituality, and culture. 

The show begins with Elisabeth telling us about her YouTube channel, European Kitchen. It began as a cooking channel that has increasingly featured videos about philosophy. Lana and Elisabeth discuss favorite dishes, the importance of a healthy diet, and its link to our ancestral past. The discussion turns to the nutritional dichotomy present in the United States, which is characterized by organic foods on the one hand and fast food on the other. Elisabeth speaks about her more recent videos and her desire to condense philosophical concepts into pithy forms for her viewership. We then speak to the European woman’s unique ability to nurture, to protect, and to inquire. Elisabeth goes on to talk about the feminine nature of philosophical inquiry and the complimentary and reciprocal relationship between men and women. Later, the discussion turns to staving off nihilism through positivity, paganism, achieving spiritual actualization through integrity, and femininity in the Alt-Right.

Title: Christopher Cantwell - The Left is Waging War
Date: 2017-07-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3RRMZ8U_3n0
Description: Christopher Cantwell is the host of the Radical Agenda, a live, open phones, uncensored right-wing talk show tackling issues and current events from an alt-right libertarian perspective.

Chris joins us once again for lively show covering a number of important topics. After catching up, we dive into more serious matters. We discuss the ongoing political polarization taking place in America, with Chris reminding us that the Left is waging war, while many on the Right are under the naive impression that civil discourse will solve things. Later, we discuss political violence, libertarianism, and mass immigration. The first hour concludes with Chris offering his thoughts on the Alt-Lite.

In the members' hour, Chris begins by telling us about his trip to the recent Bilderberg conference. This leads to a discussion on Jewish influence, which, as Chris reminds us, is a very suppressed issue. Switching gears, we then talk about Europe's demographic plight. Chris predicts a backlash among immigrant populations if and when the welfare stops flowing. The members' hour explores much more, including the 2016 election, mainstream media, and the importance of self-improvement.

The first hour covers much more, and concludes with a discussion on the Alt-Right’s relationship with the Russian president.

In the members’ hour, we first talk about the KGB, and then switch gears to consider Chabad-Lubavitch.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=eE_9y3wbRtU
Description: Jim Horn is a retired US Diplomat, author, and counter-jiadhi activist. He is the author of Experiencing Islam: Becoming Islam-Aware, Moslem Men Fear Women, and Islam in the Workplace: Moslems in the Workplace.

Jim joins us to discuss Islam, Sharia Law, globalism, and many other relevant topics. First, Jim tells us about his background. We learn about his first-hand experience with jihadis while working as a US diplomat. Next, we discuss the threat political Islam poses to the West. Jim cites the existence of “no-go” zones as evidence that multiculturalism isn’t working in Europe. The first hour also covers Jim’s letter to Sweden, the legal nature of the Quran, and the threat Sharia law poses to America. 

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the history of Islamic conquest and debunking the idea of the Islamic Golden Age. Switching gears, we consider whether or not mass multiculturalism could lead to serious civil unrest. Jim then takes the opportunity to warn us about the effects of an increasingly diverse police force. Later, we dive deeper into Islamic history, exploring Muhammad’s life, motivations, and much more. The show concludes with a discussion on the various types of Islam, including the Salafism favored by the Islamic State.

He accused leftists in the crowd of being “gerbils” but meant to say Goebbels, yet Goebbels was the one who called out fake news and communists in his day and age.

Description: Melissa Mészáros is an English teacher and YouTuber. Although she was born in America, Melissa eventually returned to her ancestral homeland, Hungary, where she now lives.

Melissa returns to Radio 3Fourteen to catch up and talk about recent events. We begin by discussing Fidesz, the political party currently in power in Hungary. Melissa explains that Fidesz, thanks to its hardline stance on the migrant invasion, was originally quite popular; their approval rating now, however, has fallen. We then talk about the Left in Hungary, and consider the effect Western media is having on Hungarian culture. This show covers much more, including multiculturalism in America, the Alt-Right, and Trump’s presidency so far.

Title: Jason Kessler - Right-Wing Activism: The Alt-Lite Disavows Free Speech Rally
Date: 2017-06-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=44YZ3iV0qXQ
Description: Jason Kessler is a journalist, activist, and author from Charlottesville, Virginia. His reporting has been covered by numerous media outlets, including The Daily Caller, VDare, and The Washington Post.

Jason joins us for a show on many important issues, including right-wing activism, free speech, and the ongoing struggle against Cultural Marxism. We first talk about Jason’s hometown, Charlottesville, which has been embroiled in controversy as of late regarding its Confederate statues. We discuss about antifa, and Jason gives us the rundown on their strategies, goals, and overall mentality. Later, we consider the upcoming free speech rally in D.C., which various Alt-Lite figures abandoned after it was announced that Alt-Right figures would be speaking. The first hour dives deeper into the Alt-Lite’s motivations, and concludes with a discussion on White genocide. 

In the members’ hour, Jason tells us about Charlottesville’s Vice-Mayor, Wes Bellamy. We learn about Bellamy’s anti-White Twitter rants, which Jason helped expose. This leads to a discussion on Charlottesville’s handling of its Confederate monuments. Jason explains that his hometown’s liberal city council has made no attempt to be diplomatic. We then switch gears to consider the big picture. Jason compares our situation to that of South Africa, as both involve the removal of statues and demonization of White historical figures. The members’ hour also explores the future of America, Balkanization, and the demographic displacement of indigenous Europeans.

Stell offers advice for girls interested in living a more traditional life, including not swearing and avoiding promiscuity. This leads to a discussion on traditionalism: what it is, and why it’s important. Later, we talk about the question of women in politics, and conclude with a discussion on Stell’s plans for the future.

Title: Pax Dickinson - Counter.Fund: Alt-Right Crowdfunding, Leftist Censorship and Forced Diversity
Date: 2017-06-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=fIM96Da85xM
Description: Pax is an experienced technologist with 20 years industry experience. He is the co-founder of WeSearchr, former CTO of Business Insider, and chairman of Counter.Fund.

Pax joins us for a discussion on digital platform censorship, free speech, current events, and much more. We first talk about Pax’s professional background, including his firing from Business Insider. Next, we discuss his new project, Counter.Fund. Pax gives us the rundown, explaining why Counter.Fund was created, and how it differs from other crowdfunding platforms. We then consider censorship and the ongoing political polarization taking place in America. The first hour also covers the Alt-Lite’s recent interruption of Shakespeare in the Park – a stunt that has been met with ambivalent reactions.

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to discuss Pax’s upbringing and ideological journey. Pax tells us that he was raised by hippie parents, who told him to question authority. While Pax was originally a libertarian, he, like many others, drifted from libertarianism after discovering the work of neoreactionary theorist Mencius Moldbug. We then learn why Pax considers himself a Redneck Zionist, and not a White Nationalist. Later, we discuss diversity, multiculturalism, and equality. Pax reminds us that these Leftist values essentially amount to religious convictions. The members’ hour explores many other topics, including Trump’s presidency thus far, technology, and Pax’s plans for the future.

Description: On Wednesday, Majority House Whip Steve Scalise and four others were injured after a man opened fire on the Republican congressional baseball team. Scalise was shot in the hip and subsequently rushed to MedStar Washington Hospital Center, where he underwent surgery for organ damage.

Now, it would be easy to write off this shooting as being nothing more than an isolated incident, perpetrated by a lone maniac. The truth, however, is that this part of a much larger trend of Leftist political violence.

Title: Lennart Svensson - Science Fiction Seen from the Right
Date: 2017-06-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_W3iwyEhKBo
Description: Lennart Svensson is a Swedish author. Although he began writing exclusively in Swedish, Lennart now writes in English as well. He is the author of numerous books and essays, including Science Fiction Seen from the Right, Redeeming Lucifer, and Borderline: A Traditionalist Outlook for Modern Man.

Lennart joins us to discuss right-wing themes in science fiction. We first consider the fact that contemporary science fiction often comes from a left-wing perspective. Lennart explains that his work, therefore, seeks to remedy this situation. We then explore right-wing themes in a few popular works of science fiction and fantasy, including Starship Troopers, Dune, The Lord of the Rings, and The Hideous Strength. The first hour also touches on relationship between technology and science, with Lennart advocating a spiritualized view of technology as a means to resist lapsing into materialistic nihilism.

In the members’ hour, we continue our examination of science fiction and fantasy as seen from the right. We discuss Kallocain, a book which has many parallels with George Orwell’s 1984. Lennart then argues that Aldous Huxley’s A Brave New World is much more applicable to our situation today, as 1984 is more reminiscent of 20th century totalitarianism. This leads to a discussion on how the control of language is being used to limit the ability of the masses to express politically incorrect views. Later, we discuss a number of other authors, including Ernst Junger and Arthur C. Clarke. The members’ hour also explores some highly esoteric topics relating to science fiction: human origins, extraterrestrial races, and more.

Title: Squatting Slav - The End of SJWs
Date: 2017-06-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=8RIVW19QQo4
Description: Squatting Slav is a Serbian-Canadian YouTuber. His videos employ humor to expose the Left’s insanity, hypocrisy, and overall ridiculousness. 

Squatting Slav joins us to discuss his videos, Serbian history, European politics, and much more. To begin, Squatting Slav tells us about what prompted him to start a YouTube channel. We then consider Serbia, and the strong connection Squatting Slav feels with his ancestral homeland. This leads to a discussion on Serbian history – in particular, how Serbia’s involvement in various wars in the 90s affects its outlook on contemporary politics. Switching gears, we talk about the migrant crisis, Islamic terrorism, and Eastern Europe’s refusal to accept mass immigration from the third world. The first hour concludes with a discussion on Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, and how his ideas have influenced Europe’s ruling elite. 

In the members’ hour, we begin by considering China. Squatting Slav explains how immigrants who come to the West are oftentimes primarily concerned with their own ethnic interests. We then discuss the similarities between Canada and Sweden. Both, we agree, have kicked the progressive agenda into overdrive, and are thus more socialist than liberal. Later, we talk about the anti-SJW movement in Canada. Squatting Slav points out that there is now a massive anti-SJW movement, not only in Canada, but in the West overall. As such, the influence of SJWs appears to be waning. Our show covers much more, and concludes with a discussion on the future of Serbia.

Title: Tara McCarthy - UK Election in the Wake of Three Terrorist Attacks
Date: 2017-06-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2F6YTfPc608
Description: Tara is a British YouTuber, host of the Reality Calls podcast, and co-host of Virtue of the West. 

Tara returns to Red Ice to discuss the 2017 UK general election, current events, and the many problems plaguing Britain. We begin by talking about the election. Tara tells us about the various parties and politicians, and explains why UKIP has been floundering since Brexit. We then consider Islamic terrorism – a timely topic, considering the recent London Bridge attack. Tara explains that Theresa May’s response has been to propose internet censorship, effectively stripping the rights from innocent citizens rather than dealing with the elephant in the room: Muslim immigration. This leads to a discussion on nationalism, including the various ways in which it is superior to multiculturalism. Our show concludes with a discussion on the Alt-Right, trolling, and the need for less bickering within the movement.

Title: Operation Reinhard - The Religious Question: Toward a New Mythos
Date: 2017-06-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7kII8KldFas
Description: Every great civilization requires a uniting mythos – a narrative that serves as its ideological foundation and provides a meaningful narrative for its past, present, and future. A quick glance at the Alt-Right reveals that we have Christians of various denominations, Pagans, atheists, and agnostics. As such, we are need of a new mythos – one that transcends our differences and unites us.

Title: James Bowery and Kevin MacDonald - The Moral Individual vs Acting As One
Date: 2017-06-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7sJTHq7Lg4A
Description: This show is guest hosted by James Bowery. James is an American IT pioneer who descends from Scotch-Irish ancestry, with the patriline geographically concentrated in Groningen, Netherlands. He is the architect of Sorotocracy.org

Dr. Kevin MacDonald has a Ph.D. in Biobehavioral Sciences and is an expert on Jewish influence and identity. He is also the editor and chief contributor of The Occidental Observer, an online publication that focuses on White identity, White interests, and the culture of the West.

Kevin MacDonald and James Bowery discuss the dilemma of individualism in white identity. The white predisposition toward respect of the individual and fairness guarantee defeat if extended into war. White identitarians, recognizing the war being waged against whites, are denouncing individualism for this reason. Among the most dedicated adversaries of white identity are many whites who wield weapons of moral rhetoric forged in the Jewish intellectual movements MacDonald describes in "The Culture of Critique". Proclaiming the "individual" as preeminent these intellectual movements simultaneously, proclaim the interests of "protected groups" exempt from individualism. Bowery argues this moral rhetoric is, in effect, an ethno-specific biological weapon targeting an essential racial character of whites: A sense of fairness toward individuals. MacDonald focuses on indoctrination of such moral rhetoric as decisive but concurs there may very well be a heritable component that is characteristic of whites. Bowery poses the riddle of white military superiority throughout much of history as contrasted against white impotence against these ethno-specific bio-weapons of moral rhetoric.

Title: Mark Collett - The London Bridge Terror Attack Was Preventable
Date: 2017-06-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=A3UuArC18Ro
Description: Mark Collett is a British political activist and the author of The Fall of Western Man. He has been politically active since his late teens and was formerly the Youth Leader and Head of Publicity for the British National Party. In 2004 he was arrested for several speeches he made and in 2006 was tried and found not guilty on all counts. Mark now works with numerous groups both in the UK and abroad and produces his own weekly podcast.

Mark returns to Red Ice in the wake of the London Bridge terror attack to discuss recent events, Islamic terrorism, and multiculturalism. We begin by talking about the recent attack in London. Mark reminds us that London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, previously stated that terrorist attacks are part and parcel of living in a big city. This leads to a discussion on the failure of multiculturalism in Britain. Mark tells us that British Muslims are overwhelmingly on welfare, live in insular communities, and have very little in common with native Brits. The first hour explores many other topics, including the establishment’s response to such acts of terrorism, the firing of Breitbart writer Katie McHugh, and what a future without Europeans would look like. 

In the members’ hour, we pick up where we left off in our discussion on Britain’s current plight. We discuss the mainstream media’s response to Islamic terrorism. Mark points out that the media never addresses the underlying causes of these attacks: multiculturalism, the migrant invasion, and radical Islam, to name a few. We then discuss the recent accusations that CNN staged a Muslim protest after the London Bridge attack. Switching gears, Mark outlines many of the views held by British Muslims – views that antithetical to not only traditional British culture, but liberalism as well. The members’ hour also covers voting patterns among immigrants, individualism, and solutions to the West’s crisis.

Title: Roundtable - June 6th: The National Day of Sweden
Date: 2017-06-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1KLLGmcaQCY
Description: A panel of Swedish patriots join Henrik for a roundtable discussion on the National Day of Sweden, June 6th, and what it means to most Swedes today. On the panel: Ingrid Carlqvist, Daniel Frändelöv AKA Conrad, Stefan Jacobsson, Marcus Follin AKA The Golden One, and Christoffer Dulny.

Our show begins with Ingrid arguing National Day, unlike Midsummer, isn’t a particularly important day for most Swedes. We then discuss how National Day is used by progressives to welcome foreigners into Sweden. Marcus reminds us that all people of European heritage are facing a similar threat, and thus share the same destiny. Switching gears, we discuss the cyclical nature of civilization, and how times of great struggle often lead to rebirth. Later, we consider the importance of metapolitics, with Marcus stressing the need for more Alt-Right art and music. Our show also explores the demonization of Swedish men, healthy gender relations, and much more.

Title: James Allsup - College Republican Against Globalism & Cultural Marxism
Date: 2017-06-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=GTt5RSSYF_M
Description: James Allsup is a YouTube partner, writer, and former political operative. He runs a YouTube political commentary channel with over 100k subscribers, writes for The Liberty Conservative, and was the Senior Adviser for the Students for Trump organization in the 2016 election cycle. He is a senior at Washington State University and former chairman of the Washington College Republicans Federation.

James joins us for a lively discussion on globalism, Trump, the Alt-Right, and much more. We first discuss James’ background, including how he came to be involved in politics. This leads to a discussion on the current state of American universities. James fills us in on the recent insanity at Evergreen State, where White students and professors have been terrorized for refusing to submit to the demands of social justice warriors. Switching gears, we discuss the pitfalls of democracy, the reality of identity politics, and the red-pilling effect Leftist academia is having on students. The first hour concludes with a discussion on Donald Trump, the Alt-Lite, and how criticizing blue-haired feminists will only take us so far. 

In the members’ hour, we give some consideration to the theories regarding the murder of Seth Rich. We examine some of the evidence, which James finds to be cause for suspicion. We then discuss diversity. James notes that the logical conclusion of diversity is simply fewer Whites – not a multicultural utopia. Later, we discuss globalism, and the elite’s efforts to destroy true diversity through the mass mixing of cultures. James then argues that this, combined with anti-White propaganda, is convincing non-Whites to blame everything on White people. The members’ hour explores a number of other topics, including the future of Rebel Media.

Title: Gilad Atzmon - Being in Time: Jerusalem & Athens
Date: 2017-06-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=yDBir720kAY
Description: Gilad Atzmon is an Israeli born jazz musician and author that lives and works in England. He is trained in composition and jazz at the Rubin Academy of Music, Jerusalem. He is a member of the Blockheads, founded the Orient House Ensemble in London, and has recorded and performed with many rock music legends. Gilad also writes on political matters, social issues, Jewish identity and culture. Atzmon is the author of The Wandering Who, A to Zion – The Definitive Israeli Lexicon, and Being in Time: A Post-Political Manifesto. 

Gilad returns to Red Ice to discuss his new book, Being in Time, political censorship, Marxism, and much more. To begin, Gilad tells us about a recent incident in which antifa, unhappy with his outspoken views, attacked him. Gilad uses this story to draw attention to the fact that the West is currently divided between those who believe in civil debate, and those who do not. We discuss how the elite caters to the later, silencing views in opposition to the globalist agenda. Later, we discuss Trump, the Left’s curious relationship with the working class, and the role identity plays in politics. 

In the members’ hour, we discuss how the Left discarded its support for free speech. We then talk about Karl Marx. Gilad argues that Marx was, all things considered, an intellectual open to debate and philosophical inquiry; his followers, as Gilad explains, then took his ideas and turned them into dogma. Switching gears, we discuss Gilad’s recent book, Being in Time. Gilad outlines some of its main ideas, and describes how it relates to The Bell Curve – a book which has been thoroughly suppressed and attacked by egalitarian academics. This leads to a discussion on the ruling elite: who they are, how they came to power, and to what extent Jews play a role. Our show covers much more, and concludes with a discussion of the Manchester bombing.

Date: 2017-05-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=JXgh003V54s
Description: Gorgo is an Australian YouTuber. Her videos explore themes such as nationalism, identity, and traditionalism.

To begin, Gorgo tells us about how she arrived at the Alt-Right. We learn about how she came to discard feminism, and the positive effects this had on her life. Gorgo explains that feminism instilled in her a sense of victimhood, which led to depression. This leads to a discussion on the importance of tradition. We then discuss egalitarianism. Gorgo makes a case for embracing differences and inequality, as they are fundamental aspects of reality. Later, Gorgo shares her thoughts on the Alt-Right, explaining that she appreciates the movement’s emphasis on positive values. Our show covers much more, including Gorgo’s thoughts on the Alt-Right, demographics, and multiculturalism.

Title: Andy Nowicki - Meta-Pizzagate: The Investigation Continues
Date: 2017-05-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=eBohFaQQ3RI
Description: Andy Nowicki is the assistant editor of Alternative Right and author of many books, including Meta-#Pizzagate, The Columbine Pilgrim, and Notes Before Death.

Andy returns to Red Ice to discuss his recent book, Meta-#Pizzagate, and a number of related topics. We begin by discussing the mainstream media treatment of Pizzagate. Andy explains that the media has been incredibly disingenuous, claiming that Pizzagate has been “debunked” without even considering the evidence. This leads of a broad discussion on Pizzagate, covering James Alefantis, John Podesta, and the DNC. The first hour delves into the motivations of our ruling elite, and why, by embracing an inverted morality, they are not like us.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on Pizzagate. Henrik poses the question: has Pizzagate fizzled out? Andy assures us that this is not the case; many researchers are continuing to investigate the elite’s involvement in sex trafficking – despite facing substantial censorship. We then switch gears to discuss Donald Trump’s presidency thus far. Andy tells us that he has always been a bit apprehensive about Trump, and reminds us that a lot happens behind the scenes that we will likely never know about. The members’ hour concludes with a consideration of how to deal with Pizzagate in the future.

Title: Operation Reinhard - Against Equality
Date: 2017-05-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=STZ0Ar0b-iA
Description: Equality is somewhat of a sacred value for the Left. To even suggest that all individuals or groups might not be equal is tantamount to heresy within the progressive paradigm. Given that the drive for equality constitutes a major part of the Left’s destructive agenda, this concept is certainly worthy of consideration.

Title: Alt-Right Defends Southern Heritage in Charlottesville, VA
Date: 2017-05-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=f9xHhbG3wvk
Description: On May 13th, around two-hundred Alt-Right supporters gathered in Charlottseville, VA. To protest the removal of the Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson statues. Later that night, they marched with fire lit torches to the Robert E. Lee statue. They held a flame lit vigil to pay respect to Southern heritage and ancestors. Mainstream Media reported that this was virtually a KKK rally. The mainstream media are nothing but liars. Our culture, heritage & history are being attacked and removed. Defending it is not hate, it is love for what is exclusively ours. We will continue to defend it. We will not back down!

Title: Jim Goad - SJWs: The New Church Ladies
Date: 2017-05-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1lE955SuTNE
Description: Jim Goad is an American writer and publisher. He is the author of The Redneck Manifesto and The New Church Ladies. Jim also co-authored and published the magazine ANSWER ME!.

Jim returns to Red Ice to discuss his new book, current events, and the ongoing insanity of the Left. First, Jim tells us about The New Church Ladies. We discuss the puritanical nature of social justice warriors, including their obsession with microaggressions. Jim argues that such a mindset is the result of material excess, as people struggling to feed themselves would have more important things to worry about. Later, we ponder what motivates the Left, and Jim offers some advice for interacting with these new church ladies. The first hour also touches on anti-Whiteness, multiculturalism, and how becoming a father altered Jim’s perspective for the better. 

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to discuss President Trump. Jim relates his frustration with Trump’s decision to bomb Syria. We then mull over the hurdles Trump has faced since taking office, including his battle to instate a temporary travel ban. We then discuss the cult of guilt that has taken over the West. Later, we consider why White identity – once commonplace – has been so vilified in recent years; this, Jim argues, is mostly because White solidarity poses an obstacle to globalism. The members’ hour covers much more, including what can be done to oppose Cultural Marxism and save the West.

Title: Igor & Darya - What Do Russians Think About the Liberal World Order and Russophobia in the West?
Date: 2017-05-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=FuiTjREOQe0
Description: Igor Starkov is a photographer, journalist, and art-curator. Darya Andreeva is a journalist affiliated with multiple news outlets, including Russia Today. 

After some necessary introductions, we dive into the main topic of our show: Russia. First, Igor and Darya tell us what they think about the Russian hysteria sweeping the West. Next, we discuss Russia’s political system, which is, contrary to what some might think, neither Communist nor fascist. Igor and Darya explain that Russia is quite conservative, and that the average Russian would be considered far-right in America. Our show covers many other topics, including Russian identity, multiculturalism, and how Russia views the Alt-Right.

Title: Nick Land - The Dark Enlightenment: Neoreaction & Modernity
Date: 2017-05-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oAT14h5_lMo
Description: Nick Land is an English philosopher, writer, and pioneer of the theory fiction genre. He is also known for being a primary theorist of the Neoreactionary movement.

Nick joins us for a fascinating discussion on Neoreaction, progressivism, and the future of Western civilization. We begin by discussing Nick’s background. Initially a libertarian, Nick eventually stumbled upon the work of Mencius Moldbug. This leads to a consideration of the central ideas of Neoreaction. We discuss neocameralism, an approach to governance that incorporates free market forces. Nick then describes the cathedral, which refers to the alliance of institutions – NGOs, corporations, academia, etc. – responsible for promoting progressivism. Later, Nick draws an apt comparison between the invention of the printing press and the rise of the Internet. The first hour touches on much more, including universalism, modernity, and multiculturalism.

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to consider potential solutions to the West’s decline. Nick argues that we must dismantle the managerial state, explaining that the Right shouldn’t count on being able to control it indefinitely. We then discuss Islam and European politics. Nick explains how Europe’s ongoing demographic transformation is poised to drastically alter the European political landscape. Later, we talk about the need for an ideological divorce, as Western nations have become far too divided to function properly. Nick argues that such a divorce would allow for competition between different political factions, revealing which lead to success and which do not. The show concludes with a consideration of whether or not the Left will realize its mistakes before it’s too late.

Title: David Dees - Trump in Bed with the Globalist New World Order
Date: 2017-05-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=c7PTmUzB4-k
Description: David Dees began his career as a commercial artist in the early 80s and has produced advertising illustration for Paramount Studios, Hanna Barbera, and Disney Home Video, along with cartooning and children’s book illustration for Sesame Street magazine, Family Home Entertainment, and TIME Magazine for Kids. In 2003, when Dees became fully awake to the New World Order Zionist agenda, he began fighting back with his own brand of activist political artwork and social commentary, with nearly 600 hard hitting and comical art pieces. David also designs and illustrates covers for authors of health, political, fiction and non-fiction books.

David returns to Red Ice for a discussion on his work, current events, and the overall state of the world. We first discuss Trump's presidency, and consider the possibility that he was a puppet for the elite all along. This leads to a discussion on Israel and foreign policy, with David reminding us that Trump campaigned as an anti-war candidate, but proceeded to bomb Syria after taking office. We discuss North Korea, and consider whether this Asian country has been unfairly maligned by our establishment media. The first hour also touches on David’s work, censorship, and Sweden.

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to discuss other pertinent issues. We ponder the future police robots, which David argues will be used by the elite against the masses. We discuss virtual reality, sex robots, and how technology is being used to cater to man’s base desires. This leads to a discussion on health and nutrition. David makes a case for vegetarianism, citing ethical and health concerns. Henrik, however, remains unconvinced, and argues for a paleo diet. The members’ hour concludes with a discussion modern society’s obsession with transgenderism.

Title: Ryan Landry - Political Street Violence in Weimerica
Date: 2017-05-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vNVK3IHuIEA
Description: Ryan Landry is a Midwestern family man born and raised in New England. When not working in the financial realm, he maintains the blog 28Sherman and writes every Sunday at Social Matter. His podcast, Weimerica Weekly, is hosted by Social Matter as well.

Ryan returns to Red Ice to discuss the growing similarities between America and the Weimar Republic. We begin by reviewing how the American political landscape has changed since 2016. Ryan draws attention to the escalating street violence between political factions, and reminds us that this was a defining aspect of Weimar-era Germany. We then touch on other similarities between Weimar and Weimerica, including sexual deviancy. Ryan explains that Weimar-era perversion was mostly hidden; in Weimerica, however, people are shamed if they do not accept degeneracy. The first hour concludes with a discussion on multiculturalism, identity, and demographics.

In the members’ hour, we return to our discussion on Weimerica. We touch on the economic factors that led to mass unrest in the Weimar Republic, and give consideration to the possibility of an economic collapse in America. This leads to a discussion on the infamous brownshirts: who they were, what they did, and what their motivations were. Later, we consider the ongoing removal of Confederate statues. Ryan draws a comparison to ISIS, which has been known to destroy the monuments of its conquered subjects. The members’ hour also explores equality, World War I, Macron’s recent victory, and much more.

Title: Operation Reinhard - How the Alt-Right Should Relate to The Alt-Lite
Date: 2017-05-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=S-mHfeBGTiI
Description: Thanks to its highly controversial nature, the Alt-Right tends to see itself as a lone force against the world. When you’re the only ones speaking unpopular truths, it can become easy to assume everyone else is ignorant or insincere. 

However, this isn’t an entirely accurate picture of the situation. 

As the recent street victories against the Left have demonstrated, the Alt-Right can’t do this alone. This doesn’t mean that we should water down our message, but we should do our best to remain friendly with the greater Trump movement.

Title: Nathan Damigo - What Really Happened at the Third Battle of Berkeley
Date: 2017-05-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=raNK5BP3G84
Description: Nathan Damigo is a combat veteran, university student, and activist. He is also the founder of Identity Evropa, a North American Identitarian organization dedicated to creating a new future for people of European heritage.

Nathan returns to Red Ice to give us an exclusive breakdown of the events that transpired at the Third Battle of Berkeley. To begin, Nathan explains why Berkeley is a significant location for these clashes to be taking place. Nathan argues that the Left’s premises are founded upon falsity; as such, those on the Left feel compelled to respond violently to any information that disproves their narrative. Later, we get around to discussing Nathan’s encounter with Moldylocks. Nathan describes the event in detail, and provides some necessary context, which proves that his actions were undoubtedly justified. The first hour concludes with a discussion on the Alt-Right and Identity Evropa.

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to discuss a few other noteworthy happenings at the Third Battle of Berkeley. Nathan offers an eye-witness account of the Roman-saluting, skateboard-toting Trump supporter who was wrongly accused of being an anti-fascist infiltrator. This leads to a discussion on the Oath Keepers, an organization which professes support for free speech, but has made threats of violence against Identitarians. We then talk about antifa, and the role optics plays in activism. The members’ hour also covers the psychological profile of your average anti-fascist, the Haitian Revolution, the Alt-Right as a legitimate counter-culture, and much more.

Title: PhilosophiCat - How To Talk to Normies & Agitators Posing As Alt-Right Men
Date: 2017-05-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MIwg9marj5Y
Description: PhilosophiCat is a nationalist YouTuber who loves politics, philosophy, and cats.

PhilosophiCat joins us for an insightful conversation on nationalism, multiculturalism, and the survival of the West. We first learn about her upbringing, including how she came to be a race realist. Next, we ponder why many White people are seemingly indifferent to the survival of their group. This leads to a discussion on White guilt. PhilosophiCat argues that there is something about ethnic Europeans that makes them uniquely prone to guilt – a trait that has been weaponized against us. The show also covers differences between Right-wing and Left-wing political movements, degeneracy in mass media, and the experience of women in the Alt-Right.

Title: Operation Reinhard - The Problem with Individualism
Date: 2017-05-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ru-7geG67eo
Description: The Alt-Right is quite often accused of collectivism by libertarians and conservatives. While there is a degree of truth to this, the fact of the matter is that groups will always out-compete lone individuals. And, contrary to what self-proclaimed individualists claim, free thinking can go hand-in-hand with ethnic consciousness. In fact, the classical liberal ideals championed by contemporary individualists were created by ethnonationalists.

Title: Ingrid Carlqvist - Scandal in Sweden When Ingrid Questions the Unquestionable
Date: 2017-05-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=rHvfBtwspPM
Description: Ingrid Carlqvist worked in mainstream media for many years, before starting Dispatch International with Lars Hedegaard in 2012. She has been a writer for Gatestone Institute and co-hosts the popular Swedish podcast, Ingrid & Conrad.

Ingrid returns to Red Ice to discuss her experience as a journalist telling unpopular truths in Sweden. To begin, she tells us about how she set out to understand why Sweden had become multicultural. Ingrid quickly realized that it is nearly impossible to discuss Jewish influence, as most people – even those critical of Islam – are unwilling to venture into such controversial waters. We then discuss Barbara Spectre, an influential American Jew in Sweden who has called for the end of European civilization through mass immigration from the third world. Later, we discuss Holocaust revisionism, and how Ingrid’s willingness to question – not deny – this historical event has affected her journalism career.

Title: Hagen Grell - Germany’s Multicultural Disaster
Date: 2017-04-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=borD8pq1NSg
Description: Hagen Grell works as a host in the German alternative media, as a reporter, entrepreneur and trouble maker for the good cause. As a web programmer by trade he's now fighting the social programming of political correctness. His main fields are journalism, philosophy, psychology and interviewing guests.

Hagen joins us for a lively discussion on the current state of affairs in Germany. To begin, Hagen explains how he came to be involved in nationalist politics and alternative media. Next, we switch gears to discuss Germany. Grell tells about the absurdity of German hate speech laws, and how most major political parties agree on all of the core issues. We then consider Alternative for Germany, a center-right political party that is, contrary to the claims made by the establishment, actually quite moderate. The first hour also covers immigration, demographics, and ethnic loyalty.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on Germany. Hagen tells us about the public response to Germany’s multicultural problems. We learn that many Germans are worried about their country, but are afraid to voice their opinions due to fear of social repercussions. This leads to a discussion on the effects of having politically incorrect views in the West, and how many people refuse to even consider right-wing ideas. Later, we discuss Islamic terrorism in Europe. The members’ hour also covers much more, including tribalism, religion, and the importance of self-improvement.

Title: Nicole - How the Migrant Invasion Made Me Become a Trad Wife
Date: 2017-04-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XFARztGNJDo
Description: Nicole is a mother, classically trained singer, and practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Nicole joins us for a lively talk about her life, ideological journey, and the overall state of the world. To begin, she tells us about her background. Nicole was raised in rural South Dakota, and later moved to Boston to attend Berklee College of Music. She describes the initial culture shock, and how she was sucked into the liberal hivemind. We then learn about her experiences living and working in Germany. Nicole witnessed firsthand Germany’s ongoing demographic transition – a transition that led to her feeling unsafe in this formerly idyllic European nation. Our show covers many more topics, including Nicole’s work on Indian reservations and refugees being relocated to North Dakota.

Title: Ricardo Duchesne - Radical Liberal Norms That Lead to the Decline of the West
Date: 2017-04-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kusx1_wRsyQ
Description: Ricardo Duchesne, Professor at The University of New Brunswick, Canada, is the author of The Uniqueness of Western Civilization (2011), and Faustian Man in a Multicultural Age, released in March 2017 by Arktos Books. He is one of the co-editors and principal writer of the blog Council of European Canadians. He just completed a manuscript with the tentative title "Mass Immigration, Diversity, and the Destruction of Canada". He is the only academic in Canada, and possibly the Western world, who rejects totally the diversification of Western nations in favour of European Ethnic Identity.

Ricardo returns to Red Ice for an engrossing conversation on multiculturalism, history, and liberalism. We begin by discussing Ricardo’s academic career, which has been slightly complicated by his opposition to the reigning Leftist status quo. Ricardo explains that some academics vocally oppose feminism, but it’s rare to find one speaking out against multiculturalism. Next, Ricardo outlines four post-WWII norms that have contributed to the ongoing decline of Western civilization. The first hour concludes with an explanation as to why Canada is not, contrary to what many believe, a nation of immigrants.

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to discuss the Alt-Right and Western history. Ricardo critiques some common perspectives on liberalism found in the Alt-Right, arguing that we should be careful not to condemn the West overall when discussing the causes of its current crisis. Ricardo then reminds us that most classical liberal values originally had an ethnic component. Switching gears, we discuss rationalism, liberalism, universalism. Later, we ruminate on Asian immigration into Canada, which Ricardo cites as a threat. Our show concludes with a discussion on Trump’s presidency thus far, and what we can expect to see from him in the future.

Title: Acharya - Dharma, Natural Law: A Remedy to the Spiritual Crisis in the West?
Date: 2017-04-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=CojRdFOQ-tg
Description: Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya is a renowned spiritual teacher, vedic scholar, and religious leader. In addition to being a spiritual master, Sri Acharyaji holds a Ph.D. in Languages and Cultures of Asia at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a focus on Religious Studies and Philosophy of Religion. He is also the author of The Dharma Manifesto: A New Vision for Global Transformation. 

Acharya joins us for an enlightening conversation on the intersection between spirituality and politics. After a hearing about Acharya’s ideological journey, we discuss his book, The Dharma Manifesto, which uses ancient wisdom to solve modern problems. We then discuss dharma, which Acharya defines as natural law. We learn that this concept has equivalents in many other religions, including Buddhism and Taoism. Switching gears, we discussing the present state of academia. Acharya argues that students in modern universities, while possessing an honest desire to understand the world, unfortunately wind up being indoctrinated into believing that dharma – the natural order of the cosmos – is wrong. The first hour concludes with a fascinating discussion on Abrahamic religion, including its history and different branches. 

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the West’s current crisis. We discuss the new word order, otherwise known as globalism, which is threatening the existence of Western civilization as we know it. Acharya makes a case for Marxism being the fourth branch of Abrahamism, due to its utopian aspirations and binary approach to other ideologies. We then discuss the situation in Europe, including its low birth rate. Acharya points out that, if the ruling elite truly valued the existence of the European people, it would instate social programs that would lead to higher fertility rates. The members’ hour also covers a number of other topics, such as the refugee crisis, leadership, and the Kali Yuga.

Title: Anne Marie Waters - Sharia Watch: Opposing the Islamization of Europe
Date: 2017-04-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8dUyizfQw
Description: Anne Marie Waters is an English political activist and director of Sharia Watch UK. A former UKIP candidate, she later launched Pegida UK in conjunction with activist Tommy Robinson and politician Paul Weston.

Anne joins us for a show on Sharia Law, Islam, and jihadism. To begin, Anne tells us about Sharia Watch. We learn that she created the organization after looking deeper into Islamic scripture – an exercise most European politicians shy away from. Next, we consider whether or not Islam is, in fact, a religion of peace. Anne cites the conditions in Islamic theocracies as evidence that this claim is nonsense. We then ponder how people of European heritage would fare if the West were to become majority Muslim. Our show covers many more topics, including Sharia courts, terrorism, multiculturalism, and Leftist propaganda.

Title: Elora, Bre & Rebecca - Femininity in the Modern World
Date: 2017-04-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=pi_IOBiKDu8
Description: Elora is also known as The Blonde Buttermaker. She is a mother of 2, homemaker, blogger, and YouTuber. She promotes vibrant living by reconnecting to our roots with traditional foods. 

Bre Faucheux is an author and YouTuber. When she's not writing or making videos for the Alt Right you can find her working out or playing with new Cajun recipes. 

Rebecca is also known as Blonde in the Belly of the Beast. She's a conservative millennial dame living in the liberal hellscape of Seattle & speaking out against globalism, feminism, Islam & government corruption. 

Elora, Bre, and Rebecca joins us for an insightful and informative show on femininity, homemaking, and marriage in the modern world. We begin by discussing how romance has suffered under a stifling status quo. Next, we discuss dating, and the importance of being straightforward with a prospective partner. We then talk about motherhood. The ladies agree that the medical community is rife with fearmongering – especially when it comes to giving birth past a certain age. Later, we talk about true femininity, the dynamics of a traditional marriage, divorce, and much more. Our show concludes with a consideration on how men can effectively red-pill their wives or girlfriends.

Title: Operation Reinhard - Kushner Rising
Date: 2017-04-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6U-tqBsTZFg
Description: Within the Trump administration there are two factions vying for power: the nationalists, led by Steven Bannon, and the more establishment friendly centrists, led by Jared Kushner. 

By all appearances, Kushner has a strong Jewish identity. 

Now, given that the neoconservatives – whose agenda can be summarized as “invade the world, invite the world” – are virtually all Jewish, pro-Israel, and interested in destabilizing the Middle East, we should be deeply concerned with Kushner’s ascension.

Title: Kevin MacDonald - Neocons to Remove Assad, Trump Buys the MSM Lie
Date: 2017-04-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=s5e14irOPbg
Description: Dr. Kevin MacDonald has a Ph.D. in Biobehavioral Sciences and is an expert on Jewish influence and identity. He is also the editor and chief contributor of The Occidental Observer, an online publication that focuses on White identity, White interests, and the culture of the West.

Kevin returns to Red Ice for a discussion on geopolitics, current affairs, and the current trajectory of Donald Trump’s presidency. We begin by discussing the recent events in Syria. Kevin tells us that he felt betrayed by Trump’s statements regarding the alleged gas attacking. Next, we take a look at the moral arguments used by the establishment to justify regime change. Kevin reminds us that these are merely justifications for an international agenda that is anything but humanitarian. We discuss the accusations that Assad ordered the use of chemical weapons, and ponder why he would do so – knowing it would anger the West – when he was already winning. The first hour covers much more, including infighting in the Trump administration and the use of photography in propaganda.

In the members’ hour, we first discuss the refugee crisis. Kevin explains that it would be more sensible to relocate them to the Middle East; but the Left, intent on demographically transforming the West, is insistent on bringing them here. Next, we consider the ongoing investigation into Russia’s alleged hacking of the 2016 election. Kevin then outlines why he considers claims of collusion between Trump and Russia to be absurd. Switching gears, we discuss the wiretapping scandal involving Susan Rice, and how Trump’s presidency has been paralyzed thanks to an entrenched bureaucracy fighting him at every turn. The members’ hour also explores the lead up to the Iraq War, Neil Gorsuch, Leftist authoritarianism, and the future of the Alt-Right.

Title: Jennifer Lokken & Ayla - Tips on Raising a Large Family
Date: 2017-04-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=cRybvzf0WR4
Description: Jennifer Lokken, The Rational Redhead on Twitter, is a married stay at home mom of six kids who are all homeschooled.

Ayla is a former leftist turned conservative, stay-at-home, homeschooling mother of six children. She is passionate about European culture and history, and strives to be a traditional lady. She earned a Bachelor's degree in German with a minor in Anthropology.

Ayla and Jennifer join us to talk about traditional parenting, motherhood, and homemaking. To begin, they each offer some advice for young women interested in starting a family. Both agree that starting young is a good idea, so long as both parents have decent health insurance. This leads to a discussion on the financial side of parenting. Ayla advises against spending money on frivolities and instead investing in the family’s future. Later, we discuss a number of other topics, including homeschooling, cleaning, family health, and much more. Our show concludes with both Ayla and Jennifer reminding prospective mothers that children are a blessing, not a burden.

Title: Simon Roche - Suidlanders: Preparing for Disaster in South Africa
Date: 2017-04-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=woOQ6cmxKIY
Description: Simon Roche is Head of the Office of the HQ of the world’s largest non-state civil defence organization, Suidlanders of South Africa. Once an ANC activist, he now works tirelessly to prepare for impending catastrophe in the Rainbow Nation. Simon lives in Johannesburg and is the proud father of many children. 

We begin by discussing Simon’s current speaking tour. We learn that he’s traveling throughout America in order to raise awareness about the sore state of affairs in South Africa. Next, Simon tells us about life in post-apartheid South Africa. He explains that, in the 22 years since South Africa become Democratic, there has been a massive explosion in crime – in particular, violence against White farmers. Later, we discuss the nature of White genocide in South Africa, what Suidlanders is doing to prepare for the worst, and why many White South Africans remain oblivious to their plight. 

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on South Africa and consider what this impending catastrophe would look like. Simon explains that the worst case scenario is the one he most expects, for he believes the government will be involved in the unrest, siding against the Afrikaners. Switching gears, we discuss the economic situation in South Africa. We learn about the various government programs that give preference to blacks, which has many Afrikaners forced to live in squatter camps. Simon then outlines the strategies employed by elites to usher in Communism in formerly healthy societies. The members’ hour concludes with a discussion on the failure of multiculturalism in the Rainbow Nation.

Title: Fabian Fj?ing - Fighting Back Against the Lying Swedish Press
Date: 2017-03-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=HAE5rHVNxWw
Description: Fabian Fjälling, also known as Erik Johansson from Granskning Sverige (Review Sweden), joins us for a discussion about his recent visitation by Expressen, one of the largest evening newspapers in Sweden. Fabian has been known to call up journalists, politicians, and other people in the Swedish establishment to ask whether or not the Swedes exist as a people. Fabian was recently doxed, and he'll share with us just why the media establishment in Sweden considers him a thought criminal.

We begin by discussing Fabian’s work. He tells us that he became interested in journalism after becoming disillusioned with the mainstream media in Sweden. Fabian tells us about one particular instance in which the Swedish media referred to a number of non-White criminals as native Swedes. We then discuss Fabian’s discovery of traditional Catholicism, and how religion factors into his views on society. Switching gears, we discuss how the aftermath of World War II led to the demonization of ethnonationalism by conflating it with mass murder. The first hour also covers fake news, ethnic loyalty, and the media attacks Fabian has endured.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing Swedish laws that affect journalism in this troubled Nordic country. Next, we discuss the Russophobia sweeping the West, and ponder why the ruling elite is pushing for mass multiculturalism. Fabian argues that the elite wants to mix different cultures and races together because it makes the masses far less connected to the past, and thus easier to brainwash and control. Later, we consider how political correctness in Sweden has created rifts within families. The members’ hour covers a number of other topics, and concludes with a discussion on feminism.

Description: Henrik breaks down what's behind the vilification of Sebastian Gorka, the Deputy Assistant to President Trump.

The hashtag #GorkaMustGo was trending just a few days ago and was pushed by the media in an effort to try to oust a man who is cutthroat when dealing with the media. Gorka, in fact when appearing on BBC called them fake news. The liberal and the media don't like Gorka and they want him out. Now they are trying to prove that a medal from the Order of Vit? is proof that Gorka is a Nazi. This is nonsense.

Description: Adam and Mary are the hosts of Good Morning White America, a podcast that tackles lifestyle issues and news events from a pro-White, Christian perspective.

After a few introductions, Adam and Mary take turns telling us about their ideological journeys, including how they came to reconcile their pro-White views with Christianity. We then discuss how many contemporary Christians use certain Biblical teachings to justify open borders and mass multiculturalism – policies that would have been unthinkable throughout most of Christian history. Switching gears, we discuss the relationship between Judaism and Christianity, and how many Christians still view Jews as God’s chosen people. Our show also covers parenting, interreligious conflict in the Alt-Right, building community for pro-White Christians, and much more.

Title: Matthias Waggener - Wolves of Vinland: A Tribe Against the Modern World
Date: 2017-03-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Y0xMQJ4sK-Y
Description: Matthias Waggener is one of the founding members of the Wolves of Vinland, and has served as the president of both the Ulfheim and Windborn chapter, which he founded, over his 12 years as a member. He is an accomplished artist and one of the few hexologists currently practicing in North America.

Matthias joins us for a very interesting conversation on modernity, tribalism, and self-transformation. We begin by discussing Matthias’ journey, which eventually led to the founding of the Wolves of Vinland. Matthias explains that a close relationship with his brother, Paul, helped him to understand the value of tribe from a young age. We then switch gears to discuss the current state of the world. Matthias argues that the modern world perverts our natural desires – such as those for food, shelter, and so forth – by telling us that we need excessive material comforts to be not only happy, but accepted within society. The first hour touches on much more, including civil unrest, personal sacrifice, and how our current crisis is making our people stronger.

In the members’ hour, we delve into a discussion on Matthias’ more esoteric interests. Matthias outlines the basics of hexology, including its history, application, and why this archaic practice works. We then discuss how intent trumps symbolism during magical operations. Later, Matthias offers some sagely advice on the subject of personal initiation. Drawing from his own experiences with meditation, astral projection, and lucid dreaming, Matthias reminds us that the inner world is vast, awe-inspiring, and, unfortunately, quite often overlooked in the modern world. Our show concludes with a discussion on the importance of carving a path that allows one to feel truly alive.

Title: Sam Dickson - 100th Year Anniversary of America's Entry into WWI
Date: 2017-03-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=dkLD0E3-CZ0
Description: Sam Dickson is a Southern historian and a prominent Atlanta attorney who offers legal counsel to White activists in America. He attended the University of Georgia in the late '60s and was active in the conservative organizations Young Republicans and Young Americans for Freedom. He graduated from University of Georgia Law School in 1972 and opened his law offices in Atlanta. Dickson is a member of the Council of Conservative Citizens and has given frequent lectures at American Renaissance.

Sam returns to Red Ice for a fascinating conversation on the history of the World Wars. First, we discuss Europe before the outbreak of World War I. Sam argues that this period was one of the best in all of European history for various reasons. We then discuss World War I, and ponder if it could have been avoided. Next, we discuss the Black Hand and the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. Sam explains that, while the latter was certainly the spark that set things in motion, there was already quite a bit of tension in Europe that led to the outbreak of World War I. Later, we talk about the Balfour Declaration, sinking of the Lusitania, and hypocrisy in America’s geopolitical agenda. The first hour concludes with a discussion on Sam’s plans for the future.

In the members’ hour, we continue our conversation on the World Wars. We discuss the American casualties in both wars, which were relatively low compared to those of other major countries involved. Switching gears, we discuss the hostile attitudes towards Germany during the interwar period. Sam explains that Britain, which had previously been the undisputed power in Europe, felt threatened by Germany’s economic success. We then consider the tragic nature of brother wars – that is, wars between fellow Europeans. Later, Sam describes the wave of anti-patriotic and anti-traditionalist sentiment that swept post-war Europe, and how this led to our current crisis. Our show concludes with a reminder from Sam regarding the insincerity and hypocrisy of our adversaries.

Title: Does The Alt-Right Share Some Common Ground With The Hoteps?
Date: 2017-03-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=LSundMOcH20
Description: One of the Hoteps, Hotep Jesus, join Henrik for a conversation about potential overlapping interests between the Hoteps and the Alt-Right. Do we share some similar ideas? More importantly, do we have a common enemy, trying to keep us at each other's throats?

Hotep argues against forced multiculturalism, for nationalism and that he'd one day love to see American Blacks going back home to Africa.

Title: Anke Van dermeersch - Women Against the Islamization of Europe
Date: 2017-03-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oY9WNhJgy5I
Description: Anke Van dermeersch is vice president of the Belgian Senate and president of the organization “Women Against Islamization.” A member of Vlaams Belang, in the 1990s she was Miss Belgium and runner-up for Miss Universe. She is a lawyer and author of the bestselling book Neither Whore Nor Slave–Women Against Islam.

To begin, we discuss Anke’s background, including her transition from modeling to law, which eventually led to a career in politics. We then talk about the Flemish people, and Anke outlines the history of Belgium. Next, we discuss how mass immigration in recent years hasn’t resulted in a melting pot, but rather an increasing number of ethnic enclaves whose inhabitants are hostile to native Belgians. Switching gears, we discuss the ongoing Islamization of Belgium – in particular, how this process has affected women. Anke then tells us about the burka ban which she proposed as a member of Flemish parliament. Later, we talk about fertility rates in Europe, Vlaams Belang, and Anke’s book, Neither Whore Nor Slave–Women Against Islam.

Title: Roderick Kaine - Smart and SeXy: Biological Differences Between Men and Women
Date: 2017-03-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=g5nIam-kOoM
Description: Roderick Kaine is an American who has a degree in biochemistry, and he has done professional research in both Biology and Neuroscience. After moving on from this work, he has focused on writing and independent scholarship. Around 2010, Roderick began his work on his book, Smart and SeXy, which describes the biologically based cognitive differences between the sexes by using the latest research in neuroscience and genetics. Smart and SeXy was published in 2016. He has been active in the neoreactionary movement since 2014, where he writes under the name Atavisionary.

Roderick joins us for an eye-opening conversation on the biological differences between men and women. After a lighthearted rumination on International Women’s Day, we dive into the main topic of the show. Roderick explains that most scientists are aware of racial and sexual differences, but choose to keep quiet for the sake of their careers. Next, we discuss anthropologist Melvin Konner’s assertion that maleness is a defect – an absurd claim, to be sure, which Roderick easily refutes. We then discuss the discrimination hypothesis. Roderick argues that it is biological differences, not discrimination, that results in different outcomes for men and women. The first hour covers much more, including male-female differences in intelligence, transgenderism, and homosexuality.

In the members’ hour, we shift gears to consider the big picture. We consider how Western civilization lost its patriarchal vigor, as globalism and Leftism appear to be guiding us towards a more matriarchal culture. Roderick argues that the root of the problem lies in academia, which has become a Leftist echo chamber. We then ponder why men allowed feminism and the dissolution of traditional gender roles in the first place. While on the subject of gender roles, Roderick argues that both men and women must be forgiving to in order to return to more harmonious, traditional gender relations. Later, we discuss how fertility rates differ by political orientation, and what implications this holds for the future. The members’ hour also explores masculinity, legal factors in sexual relations, and the possibility of a peaceful solution to the West’s current crisis.

Title: Dutch Election 2017 - Live Coverage
Date: 2017-03-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0WoDps89xEs
Description: Red Ice TV is covering the Dutch Election live with Erkenbrand & Millennial Woes. We report on election results throughout the evening and do interviews with Erkenbrand attendees as votes are counted.

Don't miss it, the future of the Netherlands and possibly even the future of the European Union is at stake.

We're starting at 20:00 Central European Time (GMT+1) / 3 pm EST / Noon PST / 10 am (Thursday) Australian EST

Title: Erkenbrand - The Dutch Election: Who Will Determine the Future of the Netherlands?
Date: 2017-03-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=8S5ql-DH6qs
Description: Michael and Bas are Dutch Alt-Right activists who are part of the Erkenbrand group in Holland. They hosted their first conference in September last year and will be providing commentary for the upcoming Red Ice live coverage of the Dutch elections.

Bas and Michael join us for an insightful discussion on the state of Nationalism in the Netherlands. After a few necessary introductions, we dive into the upcoming Dutch elections. We discuss how having dozens of political parties leads to some interesting dynamics in Dutch politics. Bas and Michael tell us that they aren’t terribly enthusiastic about the prospects of the upcoming election, as none of the parties are particularly appealing. Switching gears, we discuss Denk, a pro-immigrant party in the Netherlands, and consider the chances of a party representing the interests of foreigners entering parliament. Later, we discuss multiculturalism, White guilt, and how Holland’s colonial history is used for political purposes against the Dutch.

Title: Ryan Faulk - In Defense of First World Policies & Genetics
Date: 2017-03-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=nY5QjAjgemM
Description: Ryan Faulk is co-founder of The Alternative Hypothesis, where he writes about a variety of subjects, including race realism, nationalism, history, and social science.

To begin, Ryan tells us about his background, how he came to be red-pilled, and why he decided to create The Alternative Hypothesis. With introductions out of the way, we then dive into the main topic of our show: First Worldism. Ryan then explains the meaning of this term, and what prompted its creation. He explains that referring to our enemies as the “Left” didn’t seem right to him for a number of reasons. As such, he concluded that Leftists are better understood as Third Worldists, since they support Third World policies and genetics. According to Ryan, this would then make us First Worldists, since we wish to retain the policies and genetics of the First World.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on First Worldism. We discuss the difference between religion and ethnoreligion; the difference between the two, Ryan argues, is often quite small. For example, while anyone can be a Sunni, this branch of Islam, in the real world, is inextricably linked with Arabs. Ryan argues that this doesn’t just apply to conventional religions, but to political ideologies as well. We discuss identity politics – in particular, how they’re never going away. Ryan points out that, in the absence of a racial/ethnic identity, people will form new identities around their favorite sports team, video game, smart phone, etc. The members’ hour also explores a number of other topics, including high-trust societies, race realism, and why most people have trouble accepting unpopular truths.

Title: Hunter Wallace - The Uncertain Future of the Alt-Lite
Date: 2017-03-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=WHL1nRKdkpw
Description: Hunter Wallace runs Occidental Dissent, where he writes about nationalist politics, current events, and culture. Hunter is also the news editor at AltRight.com. Reinhard Wolff hosted this show, as Henrik was out of town, traveling to the Identitarian Ideas conference in Stockholm.

Hunter joins us for a lively discussion on a number of salient issues: Milo’s recent fall from grace, the Alt-Lite’s future, Trump’s comments on Sweden, and much more. After learning about Hunter’s background, we dive right into the Milo controversy. Hunter tells us that he predicted Milo would crash and burn and thus isn’t terribly surprised about any of this. We then consider and summarily dismiss allegations about the deep state “taking out” Milo. Later, we discuss the Alt-Lite overall, and ponder why it is so adverse to so-called identity politics. The first hour also covers Donald Trump’s comments on Sweden, which were validated a few days later as immigrant riots broke out in Stockholm.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on President Trump. We discuss the ousting of Michael Flynn – an event that revealed the deep state intends to do everything it can to thwart Trump’s agenda. We then consider whether or not this marks the beginning of the end of American democracy, and whether or not Trump will become Caesar. Switching gears, we discuss what Trump must do to ensure he wins reelection. This leads to a discussion on the Democratic Party, which is currently leaderless and in shambles. The members’ hour concludes with a discussion on the future of the Alt-Right and includes some practical advice for how we can strengthen our movement.

Title: Ron Asher - In the Jaws of the Dragon: How China Is Taking Over New Zealand
Date: 2017-03-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=R4BLCu9xvRA
Description: Ron Asher is a New Zealand writer and commentator on current affairs. He lived in Hong Kong when it was a British colony and has become increasingly concerned at the way that China, through its state owned companies, is gaining enormous economic leverage over the New Zealand economy, aided and abetted by treacherous politicians who are well rewarded by the Communist regime after they retire from politics. Ron is the author of In the Jaws of the Dragon: How China Is Taking Over New Zealand.

Ron joins us for a conversation on China that is both fascinating and unsettling. To begin, Ron tells us about his book, In the Jaws of the Dragon. We learn that China has been systematically buying up land in New Zealand. Ron tells us about Confucius Institutes, which are used by the Chinese government for espionage and propaganda. We discuss how China, despite being Communist in name, is not Marxist in any meaningful sense. This leads to a discussion on the current state of China, which, as Ron explains, is corrupt, polluted, and has no rule of law. The first hour also touches on the recent increase in Chinese militarism, the difference between mainland Chinese and those in Hong Kong, and the NZ-China Free Trade Agreement.

In the members’ hour, we resume our discussion on China and New Zealand. Ron outlines how Chinese involvement in the New Zealand rail system has had disastrous results. We discuss Chinese tourism in New Zealand, with Ron explaining that Chinese tourists stick to Chinese-owned restaurants, tours companies, and other businesses, ensuring that their money remains in Chinese hands. Switching gears, we discuss how Chinese colonization is perfectly fine from a free market perspective, and why regulation is thus needed to ensure that New Zealand remains autonomous. The members’ hour also covers much more, including China’s abhorrent labor practices, and what we can learn from the British colonization of Fiji.

Title: Jay Dyer - Behind Flynn’s Removal: The Deep State War Against Trump, Russia & Sovereign Nations
Date: 2017-02-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=VGdXdbxGTlc
Description: Jay Dyer is a public speaker, lecturer, comedian and author of Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film, as well as the host of the JaysAnalysis Podcast/Esoteric Hollywood. He is also a regular contributor to 21stCenturyWire, Soul of the East and the Espionage History Archive. Jay's work covers a wide variety of subjects, including metaphysics, film analysis, theology, geopolitics, literature, and history.

Jay returns to Red Ice once again for a very timely conversation on current events, globalism, the deep state, and more. We begin by discussing the recent political assassination of Michael Flynn. Jay explains that there is an internal conflict within the deep state; one faction supports globalism, whereas the other supports nationalism. This leads to a closer look at what the deep state really is, and how Trump threatens this shadowy power structure. Later, we discuss fascism, which has been used as a bogeyman to scare people from tradition, natural order and hierarchy. Our show concludes with a few thoughts on the future of the Alt-Right.

Title: Rachel Summers - Liberals Are Modern Day Witch Hunters
Date: 2017-02-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=WsR15PcPkCs
Description: Known as the Dropout Philosopher, Rachel Summers walked away from the Ivory Tower, spent a year in a motorcycle mechanics program, and started research for her first novel, CondAmnation, in a local Harley Davidson shop. Rachel holds degrees in History, Comparative Religions, English Literature, and Philosophy. She is currently writing her fourth novel as well as articles for The Revolutionary Conservative.

Rachel joins us for lively conversation on philosophy, social issues, and esotericism. We begin by discussing Rachel’s background, including her experience in academia. This leads to a discussion on Rachel’s ideological journey, and the thinkers that have had the most influence on her. We then discuss some of the defining themes in her books, including what Rachel refers to as “antinomian mysteriosophy”; this, according to Rachel, is a process whereby socially accepted morality is flipped on its head in order to reach a new level of understanding. This show also explores many other topics, including feminism, the left hand path, modern day witch hunts, and how the totalitarian Left can be defeated.

Title: Isac Boman - Money Power: Globalism & Economics
Date: 2017-02-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=KGGOjgvfTj4
Description: Ålandic economist Isac Boman is the author of Money Power: A Force for Freedom or Slavery?. Boman’s original book on monetary theory is based on his Master’s thesis at Åbo Akademi University in 2015, which he wrote while working as a back-office manager at the Bank of Åland. Currently, he is mainly seen as a columnist for Nya Dagbladet – one of the more prominent non-establishment media platforms in Sweden.

Isac joins us for a highly interesting show on economics, banking, and cryptocurrencies. After learning about Isac’s ideological journey, we discuss his book, Money Power. Isac tells us about some of the absurd reactions to his book; by daring to take an objective, scholarly look at the economic policies of National Socialist Germany, he was compared to Hitler. This leads to a discussion on said policies, including what we can learn from them. Later, we discuss the Orwellian state of censorship in Sweden. We talk about Expo, an “anti-racist” organization partially funded funded by George Soros, and how the Leftist media works tirelessly to oppose the interests of ethnic Swedens. The first hour also delves into banking, the fractional reserve system, and money as a form of economic energy.

In the members’ hour, we resume our discussion on banking. We talk about the Bank of International Settlements, which is an international financial institution that holds immense sway over the central banks of many countries. Switching gears, we discuss the odd merger between Leftist ideology and international capitalism which defines globalism. We talk about how multinational corporations, despite being largely concerned with profit, espouse the same social justice talking points you would expect to hear from a Leftist activist. Later, we discuss the mass media brainwashing that has pathologized nationalism, which is nothing more than the desire to preserve one’s own people and culture. The show concludes with a consideration of what different cryptocurrencies have to offer.

Title: Paul Kersey - When Implicit Whiteness Becomes Explicit
Date: 2017-02-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gvRW_0D-if4
Description: Paul Kersey is the author of the blog Stuff Black People Don't Like, and has published many books on race, multiculturalism, and society, including The Truth About Selma, SBPDL Year One, Escape From Detroit, and Whitey on the Moon: Race and the Death of NASA.

Paul Kersey returns to Red Ice for a riveting conversation on current events, race relations, Donald Trump, and much more. We begin by discussing Black History month. Paul talks about Hidden Figures, a recent film that seems to suggest that a small group of black women were responsible for the success of the American space program. Switching over to current events, we discuss Trump’s 90-day travel ban, which has been erroneously referred to as a “Muslim ban”. Paul points out that the ban has been met with a great deal of support, despite being mislabeled by the lying press. Later, we talk about the growing divide in America, and how Rhodesia, South Africa, and Haiti serve as examples of what will happen if we lose. The first hour also covers Selma, Jim Crow laws, and how demographic shifts can be more destructive than nuclear weapons.

In the members’ hour, we consider the endgame of diversity and multiculturalism. Paul explains that the Democratic Party is nothing more than a coalition of different factions united by their hatred of White America. This, he argues, is a dangerous thing, for the revolution in Haiti – which involved freed black slaves massacring Whites and mulattoes – shows what can happen when non-Whites take over White civilization. We discuss how the current awakening of White racial consciousness was not supposed to take place. Paul argues that the current atmosphere of implicit Whiteness can become explicit in the blink of an eye; and once that happens, there will be no going back. The members’ hour concludes with a discussion on how recent virtue signalling from major corporations – including Macy’s and Target – has completely backfired, as many Americans are becoming increasingly disgusted by appeals to the liberal status quo.

Title: Operation Reinhard - Implicit Race War
Date: 2017-02-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_w2m_8aOMdw
Description: America is fracturing along implicitly racial lines. Contrary to what mainstream conservatives and liberals might say, Trump is not the cause of this division; he merely brought this simmering conflict to the surface. By daring to tell the truth about immigration, globalism, and multiculturalism, he gave a voice to White America – a demographic that, prior to his arrival, was seemingly content to go quietly into the night.

Title: Brett Stevens - Nihilism: Deconstructing Modernity
Date: 2017-02-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=JxWe6S6ejjE
Description: Brett Stevens writes on the topics of nihilism, deep ecology, nationalism and anti-work. He has been published at American Renaissance, RightOn, Alternative Right, Return Of Kings, Nihil and the blog where he serves as editor, Amerika.org. His first book, Nihilism, was published via Numen Books in 2016.

Brett joins us for an enlightening conversation on nihilism, traditionalism, nationalism, and much more. We begin by talking about Brett’s ideological journey, which began with anarcho-capitalism and eventually led him to Neoreaction and the Alt-Right. Brett then tells us about his book, Nihilism. We learn that nihilism in this context doesn’t refer to an absence of values, but rather a philosophical process by which one discards all preconceived notions in order to discover the truth. This process, Brett explains, is rooted in realism, for it eschews emotional perspectives and concerns for arbitrary social norms. We then discuss consequentialism, which leads to a consideration of the role of violence in civilization. The first hour also delves into what we can learn from nature, the idea that all institutions are businesses, and the true meaning of collectivism.

In the members’ hour, we begin with a discussion on the true nature of the Left. Brett points out that the Left attacks those who disagree with it, whereas the Right only attacks in self-defense. We discuss the importance of realism, which Brett contrasts with perspectives rooted in concerns for what is considered socially acceptable at a particular point in time. We then switch gears to talk about the Alt-Right. Brett compares the Alt-Right to the mythic hero’s journey, and differentiates between people who are good at a specific set of modern skills and those who are able to obtain a more transcendent understanding of the universe. Later, we discuss transhumanism, which Brett argues is the contemporary Left’s answer to eugenics. The members’ hour contains discussing on a number of other topics, including futurism, traditionalism, and the Balkanization of America.

Title: Kevin MacDonald & Andrew Joyce - Leftist Violence in Trump’s America
Date: 2017-02-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=mdjdfg0_NIk
Description: Dr. Kevin MacDonald has a Ph.D. in Biobehavioral Sciences and is an expert on Jewish influence and identity. He is also the editor and chief contributor of The Occidental Observer, an online publication that focuses on White identity, White interests, and the culture of the West. Dr. Andrew Joyce is a scholar, speaker, and writer with academic expertise on immigration, ethnic and religious conflict, and philosophy. Andrew sits on the editorial advisory board of The Occidental Quarterly and is also a regular contributor to The Occidental Observer.

Kevin and Andrew return to Red Ice for a fascinating discussion on escalating Leftist violence, Trump’s presidency, and much more. We begin by looking back on Trump’s first two weeks in office. Kevin discusses the hysteria on the Left, while Andrew tells us that he is pleasantly surprised to see Donald Trump deliver on his promises. We talk about the Trump administration’s plans to cease monitoring “White supremacist” organizations, and instead direct its counter-extremism efforts towards radical Islamists. Later, we switch gears to consider the increasingly violent nature of the Left and the future of civil unrest in America. We discuss the recent riots at UC Berkeley, Black Lives Matter, and Inauguration Day violence. The first hour also covers the petition to ban Trump from the UK and the specifics of his 90-day travel ban.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the Left’s silence over Trump killing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We observe how the Left, which has historically been concerned with economic issues and workers’ rights, is now more concerned with pushing an anti-White agenda. Kevin traces this back to the Frankfurt School, whose thinkers became disenchanted with the White working class after it supported Hitler in Germany. We discuss how this led to Jewish intellectuals becoming increasingly distrustful of White populism – a trend that continues to this day. Later, we talk about Jared Kushner, and consider whether or not there is a group of “rogue Jews” surrounding Trump who wish to take America in a different direction – for the sake of both Israel and America. The members’ hour also explores Trump’s statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Steve Bannon, and the problem with excessive individuality in the West.

Title: Jason Reza Jorjani - The Iranian Renaissance & Aryan Imperium
Date: 2017-02-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XkQfp2GmZH4
Description: Jason Reza Jorjani, PhD is a native New Yorker and Iranian-American of Persian and Northern European descent. After receiving his BA and MA at New York University, he completed his doctorate in Philosophy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Jorjani currently teaches Science, Technology, and Society (STS) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He is the author of Prometheus and Atlas (Arktos, 2016). Dr. Jorjani is also a member of the Iranian Renaissance movement.

Jason returns to Red Ice for another fascinating show, this time on the subject of Iran. To begin, Jason tells us about the Iranian Renaissance Movement, including its history and goals. Jason clears up some misconceptions about the movement, and assures us that its success would only benefit Europeans. We then dive into the history of Iran, starting with the Aryans. We discussing the origins of the very term “Aryan”, and clarify that the Aryans were, in fact, White. Jason sheds light on the relationship between ancient Iran and classical Greece, explaining that the Iranian spirit had far more in common with Sparta than Athens. The first half of our show also deals with a variety of historical figures in Iranian history, including Zarathustra, Cyrus, and Ferdowsi, in addition to touching on many other aspects of Iranian history.

In the members’ segment, we continue our conversation on the history of Iran. We begin by discussing the Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the visionary ruler who modernized Iran but was later forced into exile after a Western-backed coup. Jason tells us about the the Islamist takeover in 1979, and we ponder why Western elites would want Iran to become an Islamic theocracy. We discuss Barack Obama’s betrayal of Iranians, the Arab Spring, and the rise of Isis. Jason explains how to Make Iran Great Again, and outlines his hopes for Trump’s Iran policy. The members’ segment also explores Iran’s place in the wider Indo-European World, and the possibility of an Indo-European World Order.

Title: Swan of Tuonela - Finnish Nationalism and Thoughts on American Alt-Right
Date: 2017-02-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MBDVBrix3Ok
Description: Swan of Tuonela is a Finnish nationalist and Vlogger. 

Swan joins us for an interesting conversation on Finland, nationalism, and multiculturalism. We begin by discussing the origins of her name. Swan tells us that it derives from Finnish mythology, and proceeds to explain how the folktales and fables from her homeland are quite different from those of other European countries. We discuss Swan’s red-pill process, which began when she started questioning the migrant crisis. This leads to a discussion on Finnish nationalism. Swan tells us that most Finns are opposed to mass immigration, but that the nationalist scene in Finland is defined by a plurality of groups which don’t always get along. We discuss the mainstream media in Finland, which is, unsurprisingly, working against the interests of indigenous Finns. Our show also covers migrant rape in Finland, LGBT organizations, Russophobia, and much more.

Title: Matt Battaglioli - The Consequences of Equality
Date: 2017-02-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6YKaVR_Jx5c
Description: Matthew Battaglioli is a dedicated lover of the social sciences. He was educated through the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama, where he passed his exams on economics with honors status. He is a member of the Liberate RVA organization and has written academic material for the Ludwig von Mises Institute, Liberate RVA, and The Libertarian Alliance. Matthew is also the author of The Consequences of Equality.

We begin by discussing the recently inaugurated Donald Trump. Matt tells us that he generally distrusts politicians; as such, he’s pleasantly surprised to see Trump fulfilling his promises. We then discuss Matt’s book, The Consequences of Equality. We learn that his experiences in college – in particular, discussing social issues with liberals – led him to question the notion of equality. This leads to a discussion on the history of this oft-fetishized concept; in particular, we discuss how John Locke’s ideas concerning equality are misunderstood in the modern era. The first hour also covers the Alt-Right, Bolshevism, and ends on the topic of economics and banking.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on economics. We talk about the US debt, and consider the possibility of an upcoming recession. Matt argues that an economy is a reflection of time preference, and that economics can make or break a civilization. We then ponder how we can free ourselves from this debt-based economic system. Switching gears, we discuss moral relativism and legality. This leads to a discussion on Islam, liberalism, and how the average Leftist cannot be persuaded by facts. The members’ hour also explores Islam, gender roles, and what is necessary to maintain real diversity.

Dr. Greg Johnson is the editor-in-chief of Counter-Currents and its journal, North American New Right. Greg is also the author of Confessions of a Reluctant Hater, New Right vs. Old Right, and Truth, Justice, and a Nice White Country.

Greg returns to discuss recent developments in American politics, the Alt-Right, and elsewhere. To begin, we dive into the doxing of Millennial Woes. We consider the reasons why the Left favors doxing. Greg reminds us that they dox us because it works; since our views are so heavily stigmatized, being associated with them carries a social cost. We then discuss the media treatment of Millennial Woes, and how shining such a spotlight on someone speaking the truth can backfire. Later, we talk about “Hailgate”, which leads to a discussion on the effectiveness of trolling versus building real-world networks. This show also explores the recent doxing of Mike Enoch, which raised quite a bit of controversy. Greg tells us why he supports Mike Enoch. (Note: The first interview Mike did after his identity was revealed has been taken down.)

Brittany then tells us about life in California, including its demographic transformation. We consider the increasingly popular Calexit proposition, and what its success would spell for the rest of the country. Switching gears, we talk about Brittany’s trip to Trump’s inauguration, which leads to a discussion on Trump’s presidency thus far. Our show also covers Brittany’s ideological journey, the future of the Democratic party, and the prevalence of political correctness and Cultural Marxism in the publishing industry.

Title: Bre Faucheux - The Problem with Diversity in Books
Date: 2017-01-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2ruVfZoIERM
Description: Bre Faucheux is an author and YouTuber.

She joins us for a lively conversation on race, identity, and multiculturalism. We begin by discussing her background, including her education and how she came to be red-pilled. While Bre was initially a liberal, she eventually discovered Alt-Right videos on YouTube, which led her to question everything she had been taught. The growing prevalence of anti-White rhetoric in the West also forced her to realize that diversity threatens the very existence of ethnic Europeans worldwide. We then discuss Bre’s YouTube video, “The Problem With Diversity in Books”, which triggered thousands of liberals, and listen to a few amusing responses from some of them. Our show also explores the West’s ongoing demographic transformation, MGTOW, and feminism.

Title: Jim Goad - The War on Whites Reaches New Heights
Date: 2017-01-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=CLWp-m2cd_U
Description: Jim Goad is an American author and publisher. He co-authored and published the magazine ANSWER ME! and The Redneck Manifesto.

We begin by discussing Jim’s background and what inspired him to write The Redneck Manifesto. Jim tells us about his ideological journey, which began with liberalism, but quickly deviated from the status quo. We learn that Jim, who describes himself as a skeptic, began questioning the dogma of our day, such as anti-racism and diversity, and eventually came to realize that there is a war on Whites and masculinity. His experiences in prison also forced him to accept the realities of tribalism and racial identity – realities that the Left fails to account for. This leads to a discussion on the modern Left, which has become similar to creationism in its denial of inconvenient scientific evidence. The first hour also touches on Trump, the myth of equality, and how name-calling is the sign of a bad argument.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the recent wave of Russophobia that has been sweeping the West. Jim explains that our ruling elite is using Russia as a scapegoat and blaming the Eurasian country for rising populism in the West. We discuss World War II, and draw attention to the slanted, post-war narrative espoused by the victors. While on the subject, Jim reminds us that General Patton later lamented the outcome of the war and stated that America was wrong to side with Communist Russia against Germany. Switching gears, we discuss the “Kalergi Plan”, a name given to Coudenhove-Kalergi’s various writings which advocated destroying the ethnic heritage of Europe through mass miscegenation. The members’ hour also explores individualism, collectivism, and the ongoing efforts to feminize Western men.

Title: Nick Monroe - Milo, DeploraBall & GamerGate
Date: 2017-01-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=W7W6aSmxJx8
Description: Nick is a gaming journalist who has worked for The Escapist Magazine and Gameranx. Intimately involved with GamerGate since its inception, he witnessed Milo’s rise to popularity firsthand.

We begin by discussing the history of GamerGate. Nick tells us how the growing prevalence of diversity propaganda in gaming journalism led to major pushback from fans. We learn how Milo Yiannopoulos appeared on the scene and used GamerGate to build a personal brand for himself. This leads to a consideration of Milo’s shady behavior. We discuss the suspicious details surrounding his White privilege grant, which Nick cites as the beginning of his apprehensions about Milo. We learn that Milo deposited the grant money into his personal bank account, and later attempted to pay someone off for drawing attention to this. The first hour also covers Milo’s true motivations, accusations of ghostwriting, and the DeploraBall drama.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on Milo. We consider the ways in which Milo, a Jewish homosexual, uses his victim group membership to his advantage. Switching gears, we discuss his book deal, and ponder whether or not it will be written by ghostwriters. We discuss how Alt-Lite figures like Milo seem to be intent on occupying an “edgy, but not too edgy” niche, and do not want to fully pursue the truth. We then ponder what the next GamerGate will be, and if it’s already happening now. The members’ hour also explores the story of Brianna Wu, the end goal of diversity, and what the future holds for Milo.

Title: Tuukka - Suomen Sisu: Finnish Resistance to Globalism
Date: 2017-01-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=GPYzAaJJAl0
Description: Tuukka is a university student and member of Suomen Sisu, a Finnish nationalist organization.

We begin by discussing the recent 612 demonstration that took place in Helsinki. Scheduled on December 6, Finland’s day of independence, the event drew thousands of patriots and a sizable amount of Leftists as well. We discuss the ongoing efforts from the Left to redefine what it means to be Finnish, and the motivations that lie behind these efforts. This leads to a discussion on the history of non-White immigration to Finland. We’ll learn how the collapse of the Soviet Union was led to Somalis entering Finland, and how this country’s demographic plight differs from that of Sweden. The first hour concludes with a reflection on how Finland changed over the course of 2016.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discuss the Soldiers of Odin, including their origins and why they no longer have a significant presence in Sweden. We then briefly touch on the negative stereotypes many people harbor about nationalist. Switching gears, Tuukka explains that most peoples throughout history have ceased to be; continuing, he argues that this process happens as the result of a more dominant, dynamic group replacing or absorbing lesser ones. We then discuss the anti-White and anti-male propaganda so prevalent in the current year. Tuukka tells us that he hopes the Left continues this assault, for only helps the nationalism grow. The members’ hour also covers the red herring that is radical Islam, racism as an explanation for differing success between groups, and what 2017 may have in store for us.

Title: P??erg & Simon Lindberg - Party Platform of the Nordic Resistance Movement
Date: 2017-01-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1HAj99MxJEc
Description: Pär Öberg is Chief of the Parliamentary branch of the Nordic Resistance Movement and is a city council member in Ludvika, a small town in Sweden. He is also the spokesman of the organization in Swedish media and one of three permanent hosts of Radio Nordfront. Simon Lindberg is 33 years old and has been involved with nationalism since his early teens. A father of three, Simon has been the leader of The Nordic Resistance Movement for over a year.

Our show focuses on the Nordic Resistance Movement (Nordfront), a National Socialist organization with branches in Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden. We begin by discussing National Socialism, a form of social organization that is unfortunately misunderstood by most. Pär and Simon are careful to differentiate between the ideology of National Socialism and the actions of the Third Reich, as advocating for a socialist state with a strong sense of nationalism doesn’t inevitably result in concentration camps and gassings. We then begin going through Nordfront’s nine-point plan for sociopolitical change, which includes ending mass immigration and creating a unified Nordic nation.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion Nordfront’s nine-point plan. Pär and Simon argue for the need for a strong government – one that guarantees free speech and exists for the good of the people. We discuss the need truth in society, especially when it comes to politics, and consider the benefit of holding politicians legally responsible for their words. We then touch on the mainstream media, which at this time works against the interests of the people, and often towards the benefit of various international groups and interests. This leads to a discussion on Anna Hagwall, a Swedish politician fired for addressing the fact that the Bonnier family owns much of the media in Sweden. The members’ hour also covers Nordfront’s positions on the economy, trade, military, and more.

Title: Ingrid & Conrad - Merry Yule: Swedish Government is Afraid of the Swedes
Date: 2016-12-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=hLlhW29b0bA
Description: Ingrid Carlqvist worked in mainstream media for many years, before starting Dispatch International with Lars Hedegaard in 2012. She has been a writer for Gatestone Institute and co-hosts the popular Swedish podcast, Ingrid & Conrad. Daniel Frändelöv – a former leftie – who goes by the name Conrad, has been running the popular Swedish podcast Ingrid & Conrad since 2015. For the past five six years, he's been preoccupied with the thought of the destruction of Sweden and was previously the co-host of Radio Länsman.

Ingrid and Conrad return once more to discuss the present state of affairs in Sweden. We begin by talking about a recent Lucia advertisement that featured a black child in lieu of a Swedish one, and touch on the various responses this has elicited in Sweden. This leads to a consideration of how Sweden ended up in its current state of affairs, at which point Ingrid offers a rather unique explanation. We then consider the Russophobia that swept the West in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory. Conrad points out the absurdity of the Swedish government – an entity engaged in the ethnic cleansing of its native population – claiming that Russia is fueling anti-government sentiments among the Swedes. The first hour concludes with Ingrid and Conrad telling us their plans for the future.

We begin the members’ hour by talking about the war on Christmas. Switching gears, we discuss the Left’s assumption that White people should “know better” – meaning that the barbarous behavior of non-Whites is often excused. As an example of this, Conrad mentions that Western nations decry Russia’s supposedly inhumane treatment of gays while ignoring the fact that they’re treated far worse in the Middle East. This leads to a discussion on the rape crisis in Sweden, wherein immigrant rapists generally receive far more lenient sentences than native Swedes for similar crimes. We discuss the non-White crime epidemic in Malmö, and how the police cannot fully investigate many crimes out of fear of being called “racists.” The members’ hour also contains discussion on how to save Sweden, gender differences, and the importance of leading by example.

Title: Patrick Le Brun - The Truth Behind Assassin’s Creed & Templar Plots
Date: 2016-12-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=B-egSXnKiw0
Description: Patrick Le Brun is a writer and activist who has written many articles for Counter-Currents. He has extensive experience with the French Identitarian movement. He is currently based in the United States, where he mentors college students who wish to engage in activism.

Patrick returns once again for yet another enthralling conversation, this time on the Assassin’s Creed video game series. We begin by discussing the fact that the creators of this franchise are clearly well versed in esoteric themes, such as metagenetics (Red Ice members, perhaps?). We then delve into the historical background of Assassin’s Creed. Patrick tells us about the Fatimid Caliphate, the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam, and the myth of the Islamic “Golden Age” in Spain. We learn that the collapse of the Fatimid Empire, which was actually quite philosophical, marked the closing of the Muslim mind and forced Neoplatonists and other esoteric thinkers to go underground. The first hour also gives ample consideration to the Knights Templar and their relationship to the Ismaili assassins.

In the members’ hour, we pick up where we left off and continue our conversation on the assassins. We discuss the blending of myth and history that defines many modern day understandings of this mysterious group. Patrick describes the process through which young boys became assassins, which often involved the use of drugs, such as hashish. We learn about the more esoteric teachings of the Ismaili assassins, and discuss the meaning of the phrase “nothing is true, everything is permitted.” This leads to consideration of the power of faith; Henrik argues that, regardless of if one’s religion is metaphysically correct, faith can allow one to overcome the fear of death and perform great feats. The members’ hour then delves deeper into the secrets of the Ismaili sect, including its recent history and relevance to modern politics. To conclude, Patrick offers advice to those interested in taking a more active role in the battle to save Western civilization.

Title: Styxhexenhammer666 - Occult Rule: Are the Globalists Satanists?
Date: 2016-12-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=rRb7KA5LRrE
Description: Styxhexenhammer666 is an occultist and author. He is also known for his YouTube videos, which cover a wide array of topics such as magic, gardening, and politics.

Styx joins us for a fascinating discussion on some of the more bizarre things that have come to light during the past election cycle. We discuss John Podesta, Marina Abramovic, and spirit cooking. Styx dispels a number of misconceptions that many still harbor about the relationship between our ruling elite and the power of the occult. We then discuss Bohemian Grove, which, in Styx’s words, is nothing more than a playground for the rich to pretend that their obsession with power and money is actually making them happy. Styx argues that the elite may in fact intentionally give fuel to conspiracy theories, promoting the idea that they are diabolical overlords to intimidate the masses into inaction. The first hour also touches on fake news and geopolitics, giving ample consideration to the Chinese question.

In the members’ hour, we’ll dive deeper into esoteric topics, such as magic and the left hand path. Styx offers a brief history of magic, and reminds us that many things once thought to be magic are now considered science. We discuss the importance of self-transformation in the magical path; in particular, Styx stresses the need for self-control, arguing that a lack thereof will only lead one to be controlled by another person. Switching gears, we consider Aleister Crowley and the Ordo Templi Orientis, and whether or not this branch of occultism has any validity. This leads to an illuminating discussion on organized religion – in particular, the history, theology, and inconsistencies of the three Abrahamic faiths. The members’ hour also covers the difference between Lucifer and Satan, the ongoing Islamic invasion of Europe, and the power of memetics.

Title: Erica - What Is White Identity? - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-12-15

Description: Erica is a Florida-based, 26-year-old White identity advocate known for her Twitter commentary on social and political issues.

We begin by discussing the role of women in the Alt-Right, and clear up some common misconceptions about traditional women. Erica then describes her journey to the Alt-Right, telling us that her interest in Donald Trump led to the discovery of Richard Spencer, Millennial Woes, and so forth. We discuss the importance of identity in the modern world – especially for people of European heritage. We play a few clips from the Q&A portion of Richard’s recent appearance at Texas A&M, and comment on the mentality of the average college student today. Our show concludes with a discussion on the fact that women in the West, despite what feminists might say, are far better off than in any other part of the world – especially the Middle East.

Title: Tom Sunic - The New Right and the Religion of Multiculturalism
Date: 2016-12-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=FpxJiARBprk
Description: Tomislav Sunic was born in Zagreb, Croatia, in 1953. The son of a Catholic dissident, he studied French and English Language and Literature at the University of Zagreb until 1978. He earned a master’s degree at California State University, Sacramento, in 1985, and later received a doctorate in political science in 1988 from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Tom has published a number of books, including Homo Americanus: Child of the Postmodern Age (BookSurge, 2007) and Against Democracy and Equality: The European New Right (Arktos, 2016).

The show begins with a consideration of the New Right: its origins, what it’s about, and who’s behind it. We discuss history of the term itself, which many New Right thinkers dislike; Tom, for example, tells us that he instead sees himself as part of the non-conformist right. This leads to a discussion on the establishment’s use of labels and buzzwords to prevent people from thinking further into such matters. We then switch gears and delve into the recent “fake news” lunacy that has swept post-election America. Tom explains that this phenomenon is nothing more than the mainstream media’s panicked attempt to retain power as it is displaced by alternative media. The first hour also covers the migrant crisis, Germany’s plight, and the religion of multiculturalism.

The members’ hour starts off with a discussion on the future. We consider what it will take for the masses to realize that multiculturalism simply will not produce anything other than misery and societal decay. Tom recommends that we adopt a more proactive strategy, which includes organizing on a local level. We then discuss the Alt-Right – in particular, how our movement has successfully used irony and humor to combat the Left and faux-Right. And like the 60s-era Left, the Alt-Right is appealing to young people because it is understood to be something truly counter-cultural and rebellious. The members’ hour also touches on the economic impact of the migrant crisis, weaponized guilt, and how nationalism, although unfairly maligned, is actually the best solution to many global problems.

Title: Daniel Friberg - Rising From the Ruins: Identitarian Movement in Europe
Date: 2016-12-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kqFammtIDWg
Description: Daniel Friberg holds an MBA from the Gothenburg Business School, and former CEO of the Swedish mining company Wiking Mineral, and a founding member of the Swedish metapolitical think-tank Motpol. He is one of the founders of Arktos Media Ltd. He is also the author of Högern kommer tillbaka: Handbok för den äkta oppositionen (Arktos, 2015), and its English translation, The Real Right Returns: A Handbook for the True Opposition (Arktos, 2015). He was also the translator of the Swedish-language edition of Michael O’Meara’s New Culture, New Right: Anti-Liberalism in Postmodern Europe, Den nya högern (Arktos, 2015).

The show begins Daniel sharing with us his thoughts on Trump’s recent victory, which he believes will prove quite beneficial to the Alt-Right. We briefly discuss the Alt-Right’s history thus far, with Daniel pointing out that our movement draws people from both sides of the political spectrum. We then consider what the establishment can do to thwart the Alt-Right’s rise to power. Daniel argues that any attempts to crack down on us will only ensure that we remain in the spotlight. Switching gears, we discuss the Trump effect, including the various ways in which world leaders have responded to his victory. The first hour also touches on the Identitarian movement in Europe, and the future of Arktos.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the situation in Europe. Daniel points out that mass multiculturalism has initiated a process of polarization, by which people are forced to pick a side. He also reminds us that the defining dialectic of our day is not left versus right, but rather nationalism versus globalism. This polarization, Daniel argues, will cause civic nationalists to drift towards the Alt-Right. This leads to further discussion on our nascent movement, including what we need to do over the course of the next year. Daniel advises that us to never get lazy, and to be relentless in working towards our interests. Our show concludes with a consideration of how we can appeal to newcomers.

Title: Seth Cooper - Egalitarianism vs Aristocratic Values & Aspects of Fascism - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-12-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-DqjUfqj_2c
Description: Seth Cooper, a lifelong devotee of fantasy and mythology, graduated Summa Cum Laude from Mount Saint Mary’s University, having earned a philosophy degree in 2001. He lives by himself in the rural Northern Neck of Virginia where he continues to realize the far-reaching series that begins with The Glorious Path, his debut novel.

Our show begins with Lana asking Seth how he felt about the recent NPI controversy. Quite predictably, Seth saw through the media’s outrageous spin on the aforementioned shenanigans. We then dive into the topic of equality, differentiating between being equal under the law and equal in a more existential sense. Seth argues for a return to aristocratic values – that is, a worldview that recognizes that people vary in ability, skill, and potential. This leads to an interesting discussion on the three main ethical theories in Western philosophy. We then discuss fascism – a concept that is painfully misunderstood by the masses – and conclude our show with a consideration of the Alt-Right.

Description: We talk about the new UN secretary general António Guterres, the former Prime Minister of Portugal, who is yet another globalist elite pushing for the eradication of sovereign European nations. He was also the head of Socialist International which claims to be working towards a “fairer world.”

We connect the Socialist International agenda with Third Way politics that was spearheaded by Tony Blair & Bill Clinton, both proponents of mass migration, eradication of borders and enemies of national sovereignty.

Title: Jeanice Barcelo - Pornography: Weaponized Degeneracy
Date: 2016-12-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=C2hOJR0hIBY
Description: Jeanice Barcelo, M.A., is a birth doula and independent childbirth educator, specializing in the prevention and healing of birth trauma. She is the author of Birth Trauma and the Dark Side of Modern Medicine. Through her radio and television shows, Jeanice has worked tirelessly to expose the evils of pornography, pedophile rings, Jewish supremacism, and more.

We begin by discussing Trump’s recent victory. Jeanice tells us that she believes this is not only a sign that the elite’s power is waning, but that there is a positive, spiritual force propelling Trump. We talk about the fact that many within the conspiracy community still think Trump is controlled opposition; this, according to Jeanice, is a poor, defeatist attitude. Transitioning to our main topic, pornography and sexuality, we discuss the ways in which sexual deviancy are used to undermine the positive, life-affirming values traditionally found in the West. Jeanice explains to us that this is merely part of a greater, Satanic attack on life itself. The first hour also touches on Jewish sexual mores, Sigmund Freud, and the question of transexuality.

In the members’ hour, we delve deeper into the topic of pornography. Jeanice urges us to see pornography as a weapon, rather than an idle amusement. We discuss the fact that sexuality exists to bring new life into world, and that fornication, being rooted in carnality, therefore lies outside of the natural order. Jeanice then outlines what she believes to be the truth behind pornography, which includes occult rituals and demonic forces. We discuss how pornography and sexual degeneracy have been snuck into the mainstream with very minimal pushback from conservative organizations. The members’ hour also explores the various ways in which sexual degeneracy is pushed on children.

Title: Reality Calls - #PizzaGate: The Elite are Involved with Pedophilia
Date: 2016-11-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oSLKt1Veg6U
Description: Tara, also known as Reality Calls, is a British YouTuber. Although she originally created her channel to discuss veganism, she has since transitioned to covering politics and unpopular truths. Reinhard joins us for this show as well.

We begin by diving into #PizzaGate. We discuss the origins of the scandal, which lie in John Podesta’s leaked emails. These emails were found to contain strange references to pizza and hotdogs. Eventually, internet sleuths were able to determine that these were actually codes for something else. This led to the discovery of Comet Ping Pong, a pizza shop in Washington D.C. with intimate connections to The Democratic Party. We discuss how this pizza shop, despite seeming normal from the outside, appears to be the front for an elaborate pedophile network. The first hour also covers Satanism, spirit cooking, and whether or not Podesta and friends are serious occult practitioners.

The members’ hour starts with a discussion on the untimely deaths of a few truth seekers. We mull over Andrew Breitbart’s apparent knowledge of Podesta’s involvement in underage sex trafficking, and also discuss Max Spiers, who recently died under mysterious circumstances while investigating organized pedophilia. We consider the role that pedophilia plays in the global power structure, and agree that the elite cater to the twisted desires of their subordinates in order to gain control over them. We then explore why many people refuse to even look at the evidence for #PizzaGate – despite the fact that members of the elite have been convicted of pedophilia on many occasions. To conclude our show, we consider what can be done to ensure that those complicit in #PizzaGate are – legally – brought to justice.

Title: Jay Dyer - Esoteric Hollywood: How to Destroy the Entertainment-Industrial Complex
Date: 2016-11-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gFI_-J7-10Q
Description: Jay Dyer is a public speaker, lecturer, comedian and author of Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film, as well as the host of the JaysAnalysis Podcast/Esoteric Hollywood. He is also a regular contributor to 21stCenturyWire, Soul of the East and the Espionage History Archive. Jay's work covers a wide variety of subjects, including metaphysics, film analysis, theology, geopolitics, literature, and history.

We begin by discussing Hollywood: its history, significance, and, most importantly, how to destroy it. Jay references Plato, who argued that you cannot have complete freedom of the arts because degeneracy can harm society. Jay also relates this to democracy, explaining that an elite can, through the arts, make man easier to control by appealing to his base desires. We discuss the fact that film has, since its inception, been linked to powerful interests, such as the military and the mafia. We consider the nature of culture, and how it must be altered prior to any political change; Hollywood, having the ability to influence one’s perception of reality, has a played a significant role in this process. The first hour also covers spirit cooking, Satanism, and #Pizzagate.

In the members’ hour, we consider the future of film. Jay argues that, not unlike the book, film is on its way out. This isn’t to say that people will abruptly stop watching movies altogether, but rather that feature length films will gradually decline in popularity. We then discuss the cult of sensitivity that has reached disastrous proportions among the millennial generation. Henrik predicts that these people will eventually retreat into the Matrix to avoid a world filled with microagressions and misgenderings. Jay reminds us that the New World Order endeavors to erase not only distinctions and differences, but change as well. The members’ hour also contains discussion on the nature of art, the left’s war on tradition, and ends with an overview of Jay’s new book, Esoteric Hollywood.

Title: Daniel Hammarberg - Abrahamic Religion: The Dark Side of Judaism
Date: 2016-11-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=fpDeXVkZYvM
Description: Daniel Hammarberg is a native Swede who has written many articles on current events and social issues. He has also worked with the anti-pedophile movement Nätverket Stoppa Pedofilerna, publicizing the identities, crimes and physical whereabouts of convicted child molesters – information that Swedish authorities keep hidden. When he is not writing or engaged in activism, Daniel enjoys sea swimming and powerlifting.

To begin, we dive into the main topic of our show: religion. We touch on the history of the three main Abrahamic religions, and discuss how modern Christianity is, in many ways, quite ahistorical. Daniel calls attention to Evangelicals in particular, arguing that they are incorrect for believing that Jews are the chosen people, as their covenant with God ended after the coming of Christ. We then discuss the Spanish Inquisition, which Daniel provides as an example of the real relationship between Christianity and Judaism. While on the subject, Daniel reads a few choice passages from Martin Luther concerning the Jews. The first hour concludes with a discussion on the dark side of Judaism.

In the members’ hour, Daniel offers a fascinating comparison between Judaism and National Socialism. He argues that both emphasize a military savior, the importance of blood ties, and the desire to conquer others. We then discuss the true nature of diversity, and how it is threatened by unchecked miscegenation. Back on the subject of religion, we consider whether or not the events depicted in the Bible are historically accurate. Daniel argues that, while there may be a degree of historical truth to them, they are mostly exaggerated. We take the opportunity to explore the possibility that various Biblical accounts of God were actually descriptions of natural events, such as volcano eruptions. The show concludes with a discussion on what we can learn from the tragedy of the USS Liberty.

Title: Piero San Giorgio - Women on the Verge of Societal Breakdown - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-11-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7YaZz7go3nI
Description: Piero San Giorgio is a former businessman and software executive. For the past decade, he has studied the global economic system and its dependence on ever-expanding populations, debt, and resource exploitation. Piero is also the author of two books, Survive the Economic Collapse and Women on the Verge of Societal Breakdown.

We begin by discussing women in modern society. Piero points out that women have never had more rights at any other point in history. Despite this, Piero notes that men are still the leading voices within the greater movement to save the West. Upon coming to this realization, Piero set out to discover why this is the case. We discuss the fact that Western women, while certainly having more freedom now than ever, have been convinced that consumerism and careerism are better than having a family. The show also covers the ongoing rape epidemic in Europe, the dangers of endless growth, and the interplay between progress and tradition.

Title: Guillaume Durocher - Trump Victory: Impact on America & Europe
Date: 2016-11-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6hSpzqSwE-0
Description: Guillaume Durocher is a French political writer and historian. He has lived in many European countries and worked in politics and journalism. He writes for several Alt-Right publications, including The Occidental Observer, Counter-Currents, and Radix.

We begin by discussing the results of the recent election. Guillaume compares Trump’s victory to Brexit, for the mainstream media – through its polls and pundits – failed to accurately predict either. We discuss what this means for not only America, but the West as a whole. Guillaume explains that the American nation-state is now run by a wildcard, and that if Trump drastically alters the course of America, Europe will follow suit. We then discuss Guillaume’s background, including how he became a nationalist. We learn that he was originally an anti-war liberal; questioning the EU, however, led him to then realize the importance of having homogeneous nation-states. The first hour also explores the ongoing culture war in the West, the Jewish community’s response to the Trump phenomenon, and the origins of our current plight.

The members’ hour begins with a consideration of technology. We discuss how the internet has allowed for alternative media to loosen the mainstream media’s control over culture and information. Guillaume correctly points out that Trump, through his condemnation of the mainstream media, has furthered this effect. We then switch gears to consider the big picture. Guillaume argues that it’s okay for those of us in the Alt-Right to disagree about the ideal form of government; what matters, though, is that whichever system we adopt exist solely for the benefit of our people. Guillaume then makes a case for the inclusion of genetics into policymaking decisions, which leads to a discussion on the massive population boom now underway in the third world. The members’ hour also covers the need for willpower and determination, the vulgarization of Western culture, and the tribal nature of fascism.

Date: 2016-11-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=IH9_1Cvk7Cs
Description: John Lash is a self-educated, free-lance scholar with an interest in mythology, magic, and religion. He is a pioneer of directive mythology, the application of myth to life. John runs Metahistory.org and is the author of The Seeker's Handbook, Twins and the Double, The Hero - Manhood and Power, Quest for the Zodiac, and Not in His Image.

Our show opens with a discussion on truth seeking. We differentiate between ultimate and conditional truth, the former being an ultimate realization, whereas the latter is defined as the truth about a particular event or topic. We then attempt to outline a set of criteria for truth-seekers, that is, the enlightened consensus on a number of salient issues: Jewish influence, Holocaust revisionism, White genocide, Cultural Marxism, Communism, and much more. We consider how humanity’s base desires and inclinations can be directed toward the realization of our divine, superhuman nature. This show also covers the true nature of wisdom, religious experience, and how the truth cannot remain hidden indefinitely.

Title: Emily Youcis - The Ascent of Art in the Alt-Right - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-11-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=H7oIRfzdaIo
Description: Emily Youcis is an animator and director of the Alfred Alfer movie.

We begin by discussing how Emily came to be red-pilled. She explains that growing up in Philadelphia forced her to come to terms with racial differences, as black-on-White crime in Philly is extremely prevalent. Emily then tells us about her interactions with liberals at the DNC, and we play a few highlights from her video of the event. We discuss her animation background, which thus far has been centered around Alfred Alfer, the main character in Emily’s work. We then play her newest film, The Ascent of Alfred, while Emily provides commentary about the production of the movie.

Title: Chris Delamo - Red Pilled Cuban-American Voting for Trump
Date: 2016-11-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=t8YYxpoUhqs
Description: This show was recorded November 2nd.

Chris Delamo is a Cuban-American living in Miami who makes videos like vlogs, social experiments, random interviews, debates, and more. His Youtube channel, Red Pill Philosophy, covers a variety of subjects, ranging from politics to science.

We begin by discussing the 2016 election. Chris tells us that, thanks to Donald Trump, this is the first time in his life in which he has felt truly patriotic. We consider the possibility of Trump being a puppet, but agree that it’s quite unlikely. Trump’s penchant for speaking from the heart – on controversial subjects, no less – smacks of authenticity. Chris explains that Trump’s taboo antics hold a deeper significance, for they challenge the politically correct status quo – something that no mainstream politician has done in decades. We then discuss the word “racist.” Chris explains that most people could be considered “racist” because it’s natural to care about those who are genetically close to us, such as our family. However, Chris notes that there is a massive double-standard at play; for what is considered healthy and normal for non-Whites is often considered racist for White people. The show also covers voter fraud, the intentions of our hostile elite, and how Trump’s egotism motivates him to do good.

Title: Kevin Alfred Strom - National Alliance: Evolutionary Diversity & Cosmotheism
Date: 2016-11-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=IQGiXXrjFcY
Description: Kevin was born in 1956 in Anchorage, Alaska, to son third-generation Norwegian-American parents. He worked with William L. Pierce, Richard Cotten, and Revilo Oliver beginning in the early 1980s, producing hundreds of radio, audio and video programs, thousands of essays, and numerous articles, books, periodicals and anthologies. Kevin is the editor of National Vanguard magazine and has played an active role in both iterations of the National Alliance.

The show begins with Kevin telling us how he came to be involved with White Nationalism. We learn that he became disillusioned with multiculturalism and political correctness when he was 12-years-old. Henrik then asks Kevin to outline his worldview. Kevin tells us that everything in the universe is constantly evolving; as such, our goal is to ensure that our race evolves upwards, not downwards. He continues, explaining that there is a deliberate attempt to destroy our race, and that our traditional morals have been inverted to further this nefarious end. We also cover Jewish influence, which Kevin argues is the source of our current plight, and the role of Donald Trump in the ongoing struggle to preserve the West. The first hour concludes with discussion on the National Alliance and how the Federal government has attempted to derail White Nationalist organizations in the past.

The members’ hour begins with consideration of the uniqueness of the European race. We then discuss how anti-White propaganda and rhetoric fuels the Alt-Right. We discuss the ongoing, third world invasion of the West. Kevin predicts that this system won’t last, and as society continues to break down, more and more people will begin wondering what went wrong. We then consider whether or not we will be able to find salvation through the ballot. Kevin argues that we will not find any serious change through the political system, as White births are already the minority. In light of this, he believes that revolution or secession are the only options. The members’ hour also touches on the illusory benefits of multiculturalism and the importance of withdrawing from the system as much as possible.

Title: Ryan Landry - Weimerica: History Rhymes
Date: 2016-11-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vO2x-qq1FKw
Description: Ryan Landry is a Midwestern family man born and raised in New England. When not working in the financial realm, he maintains the blog 28Sherman and writes every Sunday at Social Matter. His podcast Weimerica Weekly is hosted by Social Matter as well.

We begin by discussing Weimerica Weekly. Ryan tells us that he was inspired to create the podcast after noticing the striking similarities between contemporary America and the Weimar Republic. In his words, history doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme. Ironically, many of the things modern liberals consider “progressive” – such as bizarre sexual fetishes – were actually commonplace in Weimar Germany nearly a century ago. We then delve into the similarities and differences between the Weimar Republic and Weimerica. Ryan explains that technological improvements have led to apps such as Tinder and Grindr, which in turn have allowed us to reach levels of degeneracy that shouldn’t even be possible. In addition, America’s racial diversity has led to the bizarre phenomenon known as “race play” – something that would have been near impossible in the Weimar Republic, which was overwhelmingly White.

In the members’ hour, we shift gears to discuss the invasion of Europe. Ryan reminds that most of these supposed refugees are not, in fact, Syrian. We then consider the effect this invasion is having on the indigenous peoples of Europe. Ryan explains how reading about hundreds of migrants being moved into a Swedish town of only 100 inhabitants reminds him of a Medieval king garrisoning his army in a nearby town. Indeed, his comparison is apt, unfortunately, for our elite is colonizing us with a new population. We discuss France, which Ryan – citing the rich history of French national pride and revolution – believes will be the first country in Europe to revolt against their ruling class. The members’ hour also covers the rise of the Alt-Right, Donald Trump, and the future of America.

Title: Melissa - Modern Women Need to Be Lied To - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-10-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Tb24YQN7COI
Description: Melissa is a wife, mother, and full-time technical writer. She has a keen interest in politics, culture, and philosophy. Melissa created her blog, The New Femininity, to connect with men and women who have chosen to reject the sham that is post-modern society.

We begin by discussing Melissa’s red-pill experience. Initially a moderate, learning about government corruption eventually led her to libertarianism. Now, however, Melissa is a full-blown reactionary and ardent anti-feminist. We discuss the issue of women in the Alt-Right, including how it is generally harder for them to swallow the red-pill. Melissa explains that it’s easy for women to be swept up in feminist thought simply because it’s so pervasive in this day and age. We explore the ongoing war on truth and beauty, with Melissa arguing that our values have been intentionally inverted – right is wrong, wrong is right, and so forth. Melissa notes that left seems to be motivated by envy, and thus hates everything strong, virtuous, and beautiful. The show also considers whether or not feminism has any redeeming qualities, and includes discussion on parenthood, SJW witch hunts, and voter fraud.

Title: Carl Lundstr? Business of Nationalism: Concern for Sweden & Origins of The Pirate Bay
Date: 2016-10-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XBmPbX4MfPk
Description: Businessman Carl Lundström is the grandson of Karl Edvard Lundström, founder of the world's largest crisp bread producer Wasabröd. Carl has founded and financed a number of companies, notably Swedish telecom, internet and co-location provider Rix Telecom. He also financially helped the torrent site The Pirate Bay getting started, something he was prosecuted for years later. In addition, he has been involved with various Nationalist organizations in Sweden.

We begin by discussing Carl’s various endeavors, including his involvement with Swedish politics and The Pirate Bay trial. Carl tells us that The Pirate Bay represented resistance to American cultural hegemony, as Swedish politicians are too subservient to Western powers. We discuss the harmful effects of open borders on European society, and we consider why more people don’t speak out against it. We then outline the various justifications our corrupt leaders offer for mass immigration. Carl argues these justifications are inconsistent and insincere; in reality, they are just excuses to replace us with a more docile, low-information population. The first hour concludes with an exploration of the need for right-wing movements to be not only entertaining and appealing, but also informative. 

In the members’ hour, we discuss the impact mass immigration has had on property and housing in Sweden. Carl argues that there would be less problems now had Swedes prevented their properties from being used to house migrants. We touch on the role of the media in the ongoing invasion of Europe, with Carl telling us that the pro-refugee propaganda was targeted at prospective immigrants to make Europe seem very appealing. We discuss how these supposed refugees bring with them the very conditions which they flee, and how this process spells the end of Sweden as a safe, high-trust society. The members’ hour also covers the motivations of the elite, terrorism, and the need for idealists to take action.

Title: Clare - The Truth About South Africa's Rainbow Nation - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-10-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Rl2eAwVodcY
Description: Clare is a lawyer from South Africa, who works for a geographical information systems firm.

We begin by discussing Clare’s background and upbringing. Having grown up during apartheid, Clare witnessed firsthand the dramatic effects that followed its abolition. She tells us that the stories of White-on-black violence during apartheid are largely exaggerated, and that most violence in South Africa was, and continues to be, black-on-black. Clare describes how her misgivings with multiculturalism and equality began once she realized that affirmative action was something indefinite, rather than temporary. We discuss how an unofficial apartheid continues to exist in South Africa; in fact, racial integration only occurs through direct government interference. This, of course, reveals an important truth: people prefer being around their own kind. Shifting gears, Clare tell us what it’s like to be White in contemporary South Africa. We learn that, although nearly all Whites are affected, they are afraid to speak out and be labeled “racists” – for such an accusation, as in other White countries, will generally spell the end of one’s career. The show also touches on early South African history, racial differences, and the state of White identity in this troubled nation.

He lives by himself in the rural Northern Neck of Virginia where he continues to realize the far-reaching series that begins with The Glorious Path, his debut novel.

Erik Yount received an education at the MD Institute College of Art, going on to work in various realms of video production. He became increasingly disgruntled with the shallowness of mainstream storytelling and created Oerstra Works as a platform to reignite sublime ideals.

We'll discuss Nietzsche parallels in the fantasy novel The Glorious Path and relate it to the modern era, focusing on the main premise, “The Gods Have Fled.” What does this mean for humanity? Seth elaborates on Nietzsche's famous statement, “God is Dead.” 

Seth and Erik lambaste today's highest moral value of pity, now central in our liberal society in contrast to Nietzsche's idea of will to power. We discuss the slave morality of current western society vs master morality of the noble. Ultimately, we discuss re-igniting Nietzsche's goal of bringing forth the Overman.

Title: Tobias Lindberg & Bechir Rabani - Sweden: Minority Rule, Disintegration & Rising Resistance - Hour 1
Date: 2016-10-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2Bw6h1BxDM0
Description: Tobias Lindberg is the creator of Informationskriget.se, a site dedicated to exposing globalism, corruption, and the dangers of multiculturalism. Bechir Rabani is a Syrian non-refugee living in Sweden, who opposes mass immigration and the anti-White agenda.

After a few necessary introductions, we dive into the subject of today’s show: Sweden. We begin with a reflection on the enormous changes this once-idyllic country has experienced. Bechir remarks that, although third world immigration to Sweden has been ongoing for decades, it has drastically increased within the past few years. He also reminds us that most of these supposed “refugees” are not, as the media would have us believe, Syrian, but instead men – not children – from other Middle Eastern countries. We then discuss the rape epidemic in Sweden, with Tobias pointing out that gang rape – a practice not uncommon in contemporary Sweden – was practically unheard of prior to the third world invasion. Moreover, it is virtually only non-Whites who engage in this disgusting, animalistic crime. The first hour also touches on the dynamics of assimilation, the victim mentality, and the need for the more reasonable immigrants in Sweden to speak out against Cultural Marxism.

The members’ hour begins with a consideration of the Swedish Democrats. Despite being preferable to other Swedish political parties, the Swedish Democrats are notorious for purging members who stray too far from the politically correct. Further disappointing is the fact that the Swedish Democrats focus on Islam, while consistently failing to condemn Jewish influence or Zionism. We then discuss the pathological altruism in Sweden, with Bechir noting that Swedes have become too nice to see the threat posed by non-White immigrants. Switching gears, we mull over our options: revolution or war, as most Swedes are likely to pretend everything is fine until the situation can no longer be ignored. On the subject of leadership, Bechir remains somewhat dubious, as he thinks most leaders can be bought, bribed, or intimidated; Henrik, on the other hand, remains hopeful for the appearance of a virtuous leader. The members’ hour concludes with a discussion on the importance unity and retaining the moral high ground.

Title: Jay Dyer - Hillary Clinton as President: Disaster for US-Russia Relations & the War in Syria
Date: 2016-10-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=QTwmBUOQ8ro
Description: Jay Dyer is a public speaker, lecturer, comedian and author of Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film, as well as the host of the JaysAnalysis Podcast/Esoteric Hollywood. He is also a regular contributor to 21stCenturyWire, Soul of the East and the Espionage History Archive. Jay's work covers a wide variety of subjects, including metaphysics, film analysis, theology, geopolitics, literature, and history.

The show begins with a discussion on the geopolitical quagmire that is Syria. Jay tells us that the American establishment has wanted Bashar al-Assad gone for some time; as such, allegations of chemical weapons use and human rights violations are nothing more than psyops. We then discuss how Russia, over the course of the 20th century, was ravaged by Communism and later plundered by the Clinton administration’s cronies in the 90s. Jay mentions that he doesn’t think a cataclysmic world war will erupt anytime soon but that we will instead see more regional conflicts similar to Syria. On the subject of Syria, Jay argues that most of these supposed jihadists are, in actuality, little more than mercenaries lured in by the promise of food and pay. The first hour also touches on the possibility of a globalist fifth column existing within Russia, fake ISIS propaganda, and the relationship between Evangelicalism and Zionism.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing how Trump, through being unapologetic, represents a break from the politically correct status quo. Jay also points out that Trump has effectively revealed the mechanisms of the New World Order: mass immigration, free trade, and neoconservative wars. We then shift gears to consider how the Clintons fit into the globalist power structure, with Jay arguing that they are simply part of a greater web of corruption. Jay then outlines how the Clintons have operated in a manner common to globalists, namely by creating a foundation to serve as a cover for the trafficking of arms, weapons, and money. We discuss how, in the past, psychological warfare has been often used against foreign countries; today, however, it is primarily wielded by Western governments against their citizens. The members’ hour also explores Milo's antics, how to spread the Alt Right message, and the power of humor.

Title: Ricky Vaughn - Banned from Twitter
Date: 2016-10-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1qkwZn16Gfw
Description: Ricky Vaughn is an Alt Right pundit known primarily for his Twitter trolling and commentary. Prior to a recent ban, Ricky’s Twitter account was so prolific that MIT named him as the 107th most influential entity in the 2016 election. Due to Hurricane Matthew forcing Henrik and Lana to evacuate from Red Ice HQ, Reinhard Wolff sits in this show as a guest host.

We begin by reflecting on Ricky’s recent Twitter ban. He tells us that the ban came without warning and that, despite a pending appeal, he doesn’t think that his account will be reinstated. Ricky then describes how he came to be such a powerful Twitter presence, which includes a brief summary of his red-pill experience. We discuss how he intends to spread the Alt Right without the aid of Twitter; Ricky tells us that he is in the process of making a website, in addition to being on Facebook and gab. We then consider the upcoming election, and how its results will have an enormous impact on the future of free speech in America. The show concludes with a discussion on how the Alt Right narrative can be spread beyond the internet.

Title: Kevin MacDonald - The Alt-Right, Free Speech & Israel’s role in the Migrant Invasion
Date: 2016-10-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=J_EIbEKxASY
Description: Dr. Kevin MacDonald has a Ph.D. in Biobehavioral Sciences and is an expert on Jewish influence and identity. He is also the editor and chief contributor of The Occidental Observer, an online publication that focuses on White identity, White interests, and the culture of the West.

We begin by discussing the current state of the Alt Right. Kevin remarks that it’s very heartening to see so many young folks interested in preserving Western Civilization. We consider the attempts of the media to tie the recent NPI press conference to Donald Trump, with Kevin noting that accusations of racism had little effect in the primaries. In light of this, we consider whether the power of the word “racist” is waning due to overuse. We discuss the complex meme culture that has developed in the Alt Right; Dr. MacDonald clarifies that he does, in fact, appreciate the more humorous side to our movement. Shifting gears, Kevin tells us about his attempts to put pro-White ads in college newspapers. Despite priding itself as a bastion of free speech, the University of Chicago ultimately denied the ads. The first hour also features discussion on private censorship, IsraAID aiding refugees in Greece and the rape epidemic in Europe.

In the members’ hour, we discuss the fact that multiculturalism has become a moral imperative, and that to even question immigration is tantamount to heresy in the current year. Kevin reminds us that Europeans are, in fact, very moral people; as such, it’s hard to convince White people to do something if it isn’t morally justified. Unfortunately, this emphasis on morality has been turned against us, as our ruling elite has led us to believe that handing over our nations to outsiders is the right thing to do. Dr. MacDonald traces this back to hunter-gatherer culture in northern Europe, wherein one had to maintain a positive reputation to avoid exile. Later, we comment on California governor Jerry Brown who just signed an anti-BDS bill into law, coming one step closer to outlawing criticism of Israel. We then touch on immigration, with Kevin explaining that living as a minority in a foreign land will invariably lead to feelings of isolation and discontent. We also discuss how the Left, hell-bent on enforcing multiculturalism, continues to argue that we must be nice to Muslim immigrants lest they turn into terrorists. The show concludes with a reflection on subversion within nationalist movements, and what we can do to safeguard the Alt Right.

Title: Daniel Hammarberg - "The New Country": Censorship & Population Replacement
Date: 2016-10-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=jpk1UB59LJs
Description: Daniel Hammarberg is a native Swede who has written many articles on current events and social issues. He has also worked with the anti-pedophile movement Nätverket Stoppa Pedofilerna, publicizing the identities, crimes and physical whereabouts of convicted child molesters – information that Swedish authorities keep hidden. When he is not writing or engaged in activism, Daniel enjoys sea swimming and powerlifting.

To begin, Daniel tells us about his online work exposing the identities of pedophiles. Despite the fact that it is quite easy to obtain information about people in Sweden, pedophiles have their identities protected by the government. We discuss The Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Rights, an organization that has been relentlessly pushing gay culture on children. Daniel remarks that society pretends homosexuals are an oppressed victim group; the reality, however, is that they are treated like royalty. We also consider Jewish influence, Holocaust indoctrination, and the outrage over Donald Trump Junior’s recent gas chamber comment.

In the members’ hour, we discuss the Left’s ongoing efforts to create a new Sweden. According to Daniel, most of the multicultural propaganda in Sweden is little more than a declaration of war against ethnic Swedes and traditional values. We then examine how equality has been weaponized to dissolve the cultural foundation of not only Sweden, but the West overall. We discuss feminism, masculinity, and how the Swedish media tends to portray men in a negative light; this only further harms gender relations. Later, Henrik notes that the new man – that is, the Left’s vision of a new type of human – will be nothing more than a mindless slave on a global plantation, ruled over by a hostile elite. We wrap up with a discussion on the future of Sweden and what must be done to preserve the West.

Title: Paul Kersey - Diversity in America: The Death of the Space Program
Date: 2016-09-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=OJDZq-rlyTI
Description: Paul Kersey is the author of the blog Stuff Black People Don't Like, and has published many books on race, multiculturalism, and society, including SBPDL Year One, Hollywood in Blackface, Escape From Detroit, and Whitey on the Moon: Race and the Death of NASA.

We begin by considering how profoundly captivating White America finds spectator sports. Paul argues that, above all else, watching professional sports provides them with a sense of identity, seeing as how they cannot have one based on their heritage. We then talk about the recent outrage over black athletes refusing to stand for the pledge of allegiance; Paul explains that White Americans have not yet realized that the American flag no longer represents their interests, but rather their demise. Later, we discuss Detroit, Selma, and other once-great cities that now lie in ruins after undergoing dramatic demographic shifts. The show also includes a consideration of the American space program, which, as Paul states, is indicative of the heights Whites can reach when they aren’t riddled with guilt and obsessed with equality. We conclude by giving Paul a chance to tell us about his upcoming work.

Title: Synchromystic Nature of Pepe/Kek & Occult Meme Magic of the Alt-Right
Date: 2016-09-26

Description: StyxHexenHammer666 and Reinhard Wolff join us to discuss the esoteric and synchromystic expressions of Pepe / Kek. Ever since Hillary Clinton attacked Pepe and then fell ill on 9/11, an occult power behind the meme magic of the Alt-Right has begun to show itself. It turns out that the chaotic energies of Kek, as the bringer-in of light has been with us since ancient Egyptian times.

Description: Henrik & Lana expose IsraAID, an Israeli NGO that is helping migrant boats reach Europe's shores by waving them in and giving them instructions on where to go. Meanwhile, Israel itself has the lowest refugee admittance rate of any country in the world. Why won't they help Palestinians or take in these migrants from Syria, the Middle East and North Africa themselves?

Title: Bart & Michael - Erkenbrand: The Alt-Right in the Netherlands
Date: 2016-09-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5mmwZUN9-rk
Description: Dutch Alt-Right activists Bart and Michael have taken the initiative to set up regular meetups in the Netherlands people concerned with the future of Europe. Their first conference, Erkenbrand, will take place in Rotterdam at the end of September and include guests such as Millennial Woes and Roger Devlin.

We begin with a few necessary introductions, including a brief mention of the upcoming Erkenbrand conference in Holland. We then delve into the ongoing demographic crisis in the West. Although this topic is certainly commonplace within the Alt-Right, there has been very little coverage on the how it has affected Holland in particular. Thankfully, Bart and Michael are more than willing to fill us in. We learn that Holland, much like the rest of the West, is being flooded with non-European immigrants. Major cities like Amsterdam are already nearly half non-Dutch; the countryside, unfortunately, is beginning to undergo a similar transformation. We also discuss Geert Wilders, the establishment right, and whether or not we will be able to save our countries through the political process.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the vital role that networking plays within our movement. We consider the fact that many aspects of Western culture – history, myths, art, etc. – are currently being altered or, in some cases, blatantly removed for political reasons. Bart and Michael then tell us more about Amsterdam. Thanks to 100 years of socialist rule, the Netherlands’ capital has become overrun with prostitution, drugs, and crime. We also discuss how liberalism’s promotion of tolerance has effectively created a culture of indifference, in which people now consider it moral to allow immorality. The show concludes with a consideration of the steps that need to be taken to preserve the West.

Title: Tacitus, Aristocles, Tharru & Titus - KulturKampf
Date: 2016-09-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=InUZRTIERn0
Description: KulturKampf is a podcast on The Right Stuff Radio hosted by Titus Flavius, Tharru Larbi, Aristocles, and Gaius Tacitus. Primarily focused on philosophy, KulturKampf was created to rekindle interest in the Western tradition and utilize the wisdom of our forebears in the contemporary culture war.

To begin, Titus Flavius outlines the origins of KulturKampf. We learn that the podcast was born out of a desire to focus on timeless concepts rather than day-to-day politics. We discuss Plato’s Republic and what it has to offer the Alt Right. Titus describes how, in Book IV, Plato offers a convincing argument for hierarchy within a society. The KulturKampf hosts then talk about their victory over a group of Marxists in a recent debate. This brings us to a discussion on the unfortunate prevalence of Marxism among Western college students. We conclude the first hour by considering the modern Left, and how radical ideologies are rarely able to achieve hegemony.

In the members’ hour, we delve into the reasons why the West is facing its current plight. Tharru cites the importance of studying philosophy, and Aristocles argues that we need a firm understanding of technology as well. We consider the importance of aesthetics, and how many people respond more strongly to beauty than to facts. Gaius Tacitus notes that modern society lacks beauty, and that the pursuit thereof played a part in bringing him to the Alt Right. We also discuss how our current struggle offers the chance for people to become stronger, due to the immense challenge that it presents. The show concludes with the KulturKampf hosts offering their thoughts on the future of not only the Alt Right, but Western Civilization in general.

Title: Jazzhands Mcfeels - Alt-Right Is All About The Future of White People - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-09-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=brH1lT1t1Jk
Description: Jazzhands McFeels is the host of Fash the Nation, a popular Alt Right podcast.

To begin, Jazzhands explains how he acquired such a unique pseudonym. We contemplate the future of Fash the Nation; although it has been primarily focused on the 2016 election, Jazzhands tells us that the podcast is here to stay – regardless of who wins in November. We then switch gears to discuss Hillary’s health, with Jazzhands shedding some light on the political ramifications of a nominated presidential candidate dying during the election. Jazzhands also briefly describes his red-pill process, which brought him from mainstream conservatism to American Renaissance and, eventually, The Right Stuff. We talk about Milo and what has been dubbed the “Alt Light” – that is, the watered down, civic nationalist version of the Alt Right. Naturally, that brings us the rather taboo subject of Jewish influence and subversion; Jazzhands notes that Jews – and, in particular, Jewish organizations – overwhelmingly oppose White interests. We conclude the show by considering the future of America and our dire need for an ethno-state.

Title: Frank Raymond - The Caucasian Mind: Both Universe-Oriented & Self-Oriented
Date: 2016-09-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ntosk72rQOw
Description: Frank Raymond was born in the Indian subcontinent and spent his early life in Calcutta, Darjeeling, and Dhaka. He attended university in England and later returned to Bangladesh, where he spent many years running an industrial business and immersing himself in the mind and culture of the people of India. For the past 20+ years Raymond has resided in Vancouver, BC, and due to witnessing the slow destruction of the once-proud Canada, he was inspired to write his first book, Sweet Dreams and Terror Cells.

Our show begins with a consideration of the ways in which ethnic Europeans differ from other peoples. Since Frank is of Indian heritage, he is able to enjoy an outside perspective on the matter. For example, he points out that many activities, such as geocaching and dog shows, seem to be unique to White people. Frank argues that non-Whites are mostly concerned with biological needs, whereas Europeans have historically tended towards participating in activities that offer no immediate, biological gratification. We then discuss how societies created by White people tend to be lacking in corruption and nepotism, with exception to the hostile foreign elites at the top. The first hour is concluded with a rather ominous rumination on the future of a world without Europeans.

We begin the members’ hour by discussing Frank’s homeland, India. Frank tells us that there is an unfortunate culture of humiliation in India. For example, it is quite common for a daughter-in-law to be thoroughly dominated and humiliated by her mother-in-law. Frank also discusses the prevalence of rioting and violent protesting in non-White parts of the world. With regard to immigration, Frank correctly argues that you cannot fully judge a foreign group when they are an overwhelming minority; this is because, when surrounded by White people and standards, immigrants will be forced to assimilate. Only when immigrants have their own communities will their true culture and behavior find expression. To conclude, Frank reminds us that contemporary White people, similarly, are not expressing their true nature since they have been subjected to cultural brainwashing at the hands of a hostile and largely foreign elite.

Title: Ricardo Duchesne - Faustian Man in a Multicultural Age - Hour 1
Date: 2016-09-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5wXilCXAz6Y
Description: Ricardo Duchesne teaches sociology and world history at The University of New Brunswick in Saint John, Canada. His Dissertation, "All Contraries Confounded: Historical Materialism and the Transition-to-Capitalism Debate", was awarded the "Doctoral Prize Award" for best dissertation of the year. Ricardo is also the author of The Uniqueness of Western Civilization and Faustian Man in a Multicultural Age.

To begin, Ricardo details how his research led him to the rather taboo conclusion that race is an extremely significant factor in both creating and maintaining civilizations. After realizing that civilizations tend to decline when they undergo racial demographic shifts, Ricardo started to understand that the West simply cannot survive without a White majority. We discuss how such demographic shifts can have profound effects on societies, as numerous institutions, such as the free market and the separation of church and state, are things that, for the most part, only ethnic Europeans value. The first hour concludes with a discussion of the attempts within academia to deconstruct the validity of race and downplay the uniqueness of the West.

In the members’ hour, Ricardo tells us about his upcoming book, Faustian Man in a Multicultural Age. He argues that the true spirit of the West is Faustian, meaning exploration, discovery, and a desire to penetrate the unknown are the defining aspects of the European soul. We consider the fact that those who seek to control and domesticate humanity, reducing them to the level of consumers and zombies, see this Faustian nature as dangerous and unpredictable. Ricardo notes that Donald Trump, through his tendency to push limits and take risks, in many ways embodies the Faustian ideal. To wrap up, Ricardo recounts his experience working in academia, and extends an invitation to any prospective scholars to come to Canada and do graduate work under his tutelage.

Title: Kalki Weisthor - German Occult Revival - Hour 1
Date: 2016-09-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PUaRpy-0HqQ
Description: Kalki Weisthor AKA Bob Weisthor is an Armanist, a Wotanist and a student of the Vedas, a seeker of historical truth, and an advocate of deep ecology, who lives in the Southern United States. He is the proprietor of KalkiWeisthor.net, and advocates spiritual Awakening of Aryan man as necessary for the survival of his people and of World Civilization. He is a former attorney and a former Buddhist whose inspirations include Miguel Serrano and Savitri Devi.

To begin, Kalki tells us the meaning behind his pseudonym. We learn that Kalki is name of the 10th avatar of Vishnu, while Weisthor was the alias of infamous SS-Brigadeführer and occultist Karl Maria Wiligut. We then dive into World War II and the controversial nature of revisionism, with Kalki pointing out that, despite claiming many more lives, Communism is still not anywhere near as taboo as National Socialism. We discuss how the conclusion of World War II was a watershed moment, with a new order being established thereafter. Next, Kalki recounts his spiritual journey. Although a Buddhist for many years, Kalki eventually had a spiritual experience which led him to Germanic Paganism. WWe then examine influential thinkers involved with what is sometimes referred to as Esoteric Hitlerism, including Savitri Devi and Miguel Serrano.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the importance of identity, and how it is necessary for civilization. On the subject of morality, Kalki explains that he is not a dualist; in other words, he doesn’t believe in a cosmic struggle between good and evil. Instead, he sees both creation and destruction as necessary forces in the universe. However, Kalki argues that we are part of the creative force, and it is our job to oppose the forces of destruction that threaten our existence. We also discuss the Indo-European traditions, Adolf Hitler, and the prophecy of “the coming man.” In conclusion, Kalki challenges us to pursue spiritual practice and embrace conflict in order to grow into stronger, wiser beings.

Title: Matt Flavel - Asatru: Native Spirituality of European Folk - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-09-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=4JZA0RWF640
Description: Matt Flavel serves on the board of directors for the Asatru Folk Assembly.

We begin with a preliminary consideration of Asatru. As Matt explains, Asatru is an ancient religion that was revived during the 70s. Matt tells us about his spiritual journey, which, interestingly enough, began with the Jehovah’s Witnesses. We then discuss the ancient Germanic world and dispel the misconception that it was simple and barbaric. We also discuss the folkish nature of Asatru, and how this integral aspect of the Germanic tradition has been lost among an unfortunate amount of modern Pagans. Matt touches on the activities that Asatruar participate in, ranging from celebratory festivals to local meetups. We also touch on the importance of identity; specifically, the fact that White people are the only group expected to not have one. More abstract, metaphysical topics are touched on as well, such as the order-chaos dichotomy that is integral to Asatru. The show concludes with Matt stressing that Asatru, despite boasting ancient origins, is a modern religion for modern people.

Title: Ethan Ralph - The Alt-Right Doesn't Virtue Signal or Denounce 'Extremists' - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-09-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=IcuHdYc_7Nc
Description: Ethan Ralph is the Owner and Editor-in-Chief of The Ralph Retort.

We begin by discussing Ethan’s ideological journey. Originally a leftist, he eventually became disillusioned with liberalism and left the Democratic Party. Ethan was later involved in Gamergate, wherein he came face to face with not only social justice warriors, but also the duplicitous nature of the mainstream media. We then talk about the recent media uproar about the alt-right, and question whether or not Breitbart can truly be considered alt-right. Ethan observes that, despite the stereotypes about the alt-right, it offers more room for differing views than the modern left, which has taken on puritanical levels of thought policing. We briefly touch on the Olympics, and how this once respectable competition has been reduced to a fragment of its former glory. We conclude by discussing the harmful effects of multiculturalism, diversity, and monoculture.

Title: Judgy Bitch - Feminism, The Alt-Right & White Genocide - Hour 1
Date: 2016-08-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=SGlZq2HktQs
Description: Judgy Bitch (also known as Janet Bloomfield) has an undergraduate degree in Film Theory, a Master’s degree in Business Administration and she has recently been admitted to a PhD program in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, but she is not sure she wants to go just yet. She is a full time mother to her three children and a full time wife to her husband. Her children have never seen the inside of a daycare center and her husband has never made his own sandwich, and that makes her very happy.

A filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members.

We begin by discussing how Janet came to realize the insidious nature of feminism, to which she was first exposed while studying Film Theory. Having grown up on a farm with multiple brothers, Janet found herself unable to accept the notion that women are oppressed. However, her disdain for feminism didn’t fully sink in until she had a son; it was only then that she began truly questioning the experience of men in contemporary society. We also discuss how unfairly the institution of patriarchy has been maligned, despite the fact women are safest when in monogamous, heterosexual relationships. We wrap up the first hour by considering how we can heal the schism that feminism has sown between the sexes.

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to delve a number into broader cultural and political issues. We discuss the alt-right, including Hillary’s amusing speech. Janet expresses that she doesn’t think the alt-right is necessarily “racist” or “anti-Semitic”, and that most of the antics within the alt-right that could be described as such amount to nothing more than trolling. We talk about Trump, with Janet observing that people are tired of getting duped by mainstream politicians and are thus thrilled to finally have a third option. We also consider White Genocide and the urgent need for European nations to stick together. Our conversation concludes with some musings on the necessity of competition, on both an individual and also a group level.

Title: Dr. Bill Warner - The True History of Muslim Conquests - Hour 1
Date: 2016-08-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=zMwcX_vU1lM
Description: Bill Warner holds a PhD in physics and math, NC State University, 1968. He has been a university professor, businessman, and applied physicist. Dr. Warner founded the Center for the Study of Political Islam (CSPI) and is its director. He has produced a dozen books, including a Koran, a biography of Mohammed and a summary of the political traditions of Mohammed. He also developed the first self-study course on Political Islam. He has given talks nationally and internationally about Islamic political doctrine.

We begin by diving headfirst into the history of Islam. Bill differentiates between the historical Muhammad and the Muhammad of the Quran. Unbeknownst to many, Muhammad spent much of his life as a politician and jihadist, and was involved in many assassinations. Bill reminds us that jihad is not only of the sword, but also of of the tongue and pen – meaning that Islam’s war against the West is being waged on the cultural/political level as well. We also detail the process by which Islam subjugates non-Muslims after they have been conquered.

In the members’ hour, we discuss Islam’s historical intolerance of other religions and cultures. Bill reminds us that much of the Middle East and North Africa were Christian prior to the spread of Islam, and that the crusades were in reality a reaction to this encroachment. We also touch upon the myth of the Islamic “Golden Age.” We then shift the conversation toward more contemporary issues, such as the current threat Islam poses to the West and how political correctness prevents people from discussing this pressing issue. In conclusion, Bill argues that people need to simply tell the truth about Islam and stop worrying about being called “racists” or “Islamophobes.”

Title: Samuel Finlay - The US Military is the Enforcer of Globalism - Hour 1
Date: 2016-08-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=cgx_tNsqcns
Description: This show was first released August 17, 2016 on https://redice.tv

Samuel Finlay was born and raised in Oklahoma and served as an infantryman in Bosnia and Afghanistan, and later earned a Master’s Degree in International Studies. He is the author of Breakfast with the Dirt Cult, a novelized account of his experiences in love and war.

The show begins with Sam talking about his time in the military. Sam explains that he joined because he thought it would make a man out of him. While he hated the military at first, mostly due to its bureaucratic nature, Sam eventually found himself in a good platoon and grew to certain appreciate aspects of military service. We then discuss his time in Afghanistan. Sam tells us that his platoon was honorable and only wanted to defeat the Taliban; in other words, their intentions were just. However, as time went on, he began to harbor serious doubts about the war. Sam eventually came to the realization that America is being controlled by a hostile, ruling elite that views the military as nothing more than a tool for their globalist agenda.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the role veterans in the Alt Right. Sam informs us that while some veterans still see America as a shining beacon of freedom and liberty, many others, such as Sam, are thoroughly disillusioned with what America has become. We discuss the fact that loving a country that hates you isn’t patriotism, but servitude. Sam then shares with us the intense cultural divide he observed between Americans and Afghans, and how progressives don’t truly respect other cultures, but instead want to make everyone like them. This fanatical need to change the world, as Sam correctly points out, it is a key part of the liberal agenda. We wrap up with a discussion on how modernity tames people and thereby denies them many deeply gratifying – and oftentimes primal – experiences.

Title: Patrick Le Brun - European Terror Wave & Disarray in the Democratic Party - Hour 1
Date: 2016-08-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=rgLroUAzbHM
Description: This show was first released August 8, 2016 on https://redice.tv

Patrick Le Brun is a writer and activist who has written many articles for Counter-Currents. He has extensive experience with the French Identitarian movement and is currently based in the United States, where he mentors college students who wish to engage in activism.

In the first hour, we begin by discussing the importance of independent media. Patrick stresses the fact that mainstream media outlets present a very limited or distorted perspective on current events. In light of this, Patrick urges listeners to continue supporting sites such as Red Ice and Counter-Currents. We then delve into the topic of radical Islam. Patrick outlines what the Western ruling elite considers to be a “good” Muslim: namely, one who bows to American hegemony and offers up their oil. This is why America has made enemies of secular leaders such as Saddam Hussein and Bashar al-Assad – all while maintaining intimate relations with the highly oppressive Saudi regime. We then discuss how Islamic extremism has transformed from simply consisting of insurgent armies to now encompassing individual, open-source terrorism. We conclude the first hour by mulling over the ineffective responses to Islamic terrorism that are so unfortunately common in the West.

In the member’s segment, we consider both the Democratic National Convention and the current election overall. We begin by discussing the DNC email leaks, with Patrick noting that the whole affair reveals the media to be fairly subservient to the Democratic party. Patrick also states that the Democratic party is very aware of the criticism leveled against them; as such, they have become adept at shaping public perception while nevertheless retaining their oligarchical core. Having actually attended the DNC, Patrick shares some interesting stories about his experience there, such as the massive walk out and an occupation of a media tent. As Patrick observes, American mainstream media glossed over these events, while international and independent media outlets actually covered them. Patrick also reinforces the idea that the main paradigm of our age is not left vs right, but rather globalism vs identity (nationalism). Finally, we wrap up by discussing the left’s plan to destroy Trump by trotting out disgruntled former employees, and how an October surprise revealing Hillary’s role in the creation of ISIS would prove immensely beneficial to Trump.

Title: Richard Spencer - The Detroit Experience & How to Get Banned from the UK
Date: 2016-08-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=X2TToh17Dk4
Description: This show was first released August 5, 2016 on https://redice.tv

Richard Spencer is President of The National Policy Institute and Editor of Washington Summit Publishers, Radix Journal, and RadixJournal.com. He was also formerly an Assistant Editor at The American Conservative magazine and Executive Editor of Taki's Magazine. Richard attended University of Virginia, University of Chicago, and was a doctoral student at Duke University before dropping out to pursue a life of thought-crime. As a result, he was arrested in Hungary at the behest of Viktor Orban and, more recently, has been formally banned from the United Kingdom.

A filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members: 
http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/extra/program.php?id=1155

We begin by discussing a private NPI conference in Detroit that Richard recently attended. This event boasted at least 60 members, with most of the attendees being around thirty-years old. Richard expresses both satisfaction and surprise at the ideological unity he encountered among the event’s attendees. We then briefly ruminate on how people wind up in the Alt Right. Richard restates his oft-repeated – and entirely correct – observation that people are being red-pilled by life; in other words, the harsh reality of our rapidly degenerating society is forcing many people to reach uncomfortable conclusions about the nature of multiculturalism, liberalism, and the future of ethnic Europeans worldwide. As such, Richard advises that, in order to be successful, those in the Alt Right need only continue doing what they’re already doing.

Next, we touch on Donald Trump and how his campaign affects the Alt Right. Richard shares some valuable insights into the relationship between vanguard and populist movements. As Richard notes, the former generally cannot expect to gain support from the masses in the way that the latter can. In light of this, the goal of vanguard movements, such as the Alt Right, is to continually shape the metapolitical sphere in its image. Richard reminds us that the Alt Right needs to be bigger than Trump – it needs to offer a more comprehensive worldview for those ready to accept it. We then touch on the possibility of a Trump victory permanently reshaping the American political realm and whether or not mainstream Conservatives will remain loyal to the Republican Party.

Later, we talk about Richard’s recent, lifelong ban from the United Kingdom issued by none other than unelected Prime Minister Theresa May. Richard relates this to Carl Schmitt's astute observation that the preservation of liberalism, quite paradoxically, often requires some very illiberal measures to be taken. He then shares his thoughts on the collapse of Western Civilization; namely, that it has already collapsed. We also discuss Richard’s eventful trip to the Republican National Convention – an event which, according to Richard, had a notable Alt Right presence. The show concludes with a brief mention of The National Policy Institute’s upcoming conference in November, which the Red Ice team will most certainly be attending.

Title: StateOfNation - Nationalism: Keeping It Simple - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-08-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=AddTabLnW4Q
Description: StateOfNation is a 24-year-old British man living in Italy who produces the YouTube channel of the same name. Among his noteworthy videos are “Nationalism in 90 Seconds” and “The Demographic Decline of Britain.”

In this discussion, StateOfNation talks about the great divide of attitudes amongst Italians and Brits regarding the civil unrest that is bubbling out of the multicultural experiment. We address the narrative of White privilege and the reality of race-based aristocracy, and State defines “nation” relative to a self-identified ethnic group. He explains some of the common misconceptions of Nationalism in relation to Western colonialism and White supremacy along with the ideals of cultural relativism. We consider how unrelated issues such as homosexuality, feminism and gender equality are mistakenly intertwined with the concept of Nationalism. We get into the validity of the right/left political paradigm, the liberal side effects of global capitalism, and democracy as a battle of demography. StateOfNation refers to CasaPound Italia’s Identitarian approach to network building and empowering indigenous Italians. Then, we talk about State’s “5 Questions for Progressives” video, which asks why it’s a good idea morally to allow mass immigration to make Whites a minority in their own lands. We also touch on some counterproductive strategies that should not be applied in spreading the Nationalist message, as well as best practices for winning people over through simple humor, positivity and leading by example. Later, State gives his takes on the divided Brexit vote, how racial identity affects political interests, and why analyzing Whiteness is an important for reigniting Europeans’ love for their own culture. Our conversation rounds off with thoughts on the UK’s current political system, the place of Sharia Law courts in England, and the tribalist way of respecting individual communities with unique cultural differences.

Title: Colin Flaherty - The Media is Lying About Black Lives Matter & Black Mob Violence - Hour 1
Date: 2016-08-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=uv3Hj63kxs4
Description: Colin Flaherty is the award winning author of the bestselling books White Girl Bleed a Lot and Don’t Make the Black Kids Angry. His story of how a black man was unjustly convicted of trying to kill his White girl friend resulted in his release from state prison and was featured on NPR, the Los Angeles Times and Court TV.

Colin returns to Red Ice for another discussion about the issues of escalating black mob violence and Black on White racial crime. We begin with a look at some of the recent mainstream headlines that have brought attention to the supposed systemic racism embedded within the largely White European US police force – one of the biggest lies of our current times. We discuss how the controlled media relentlessly hammers away at convoluted stories of black oppression and discrimination while brushing over the truth of the insane hostility and violence that cops and average citizens deal with on a regular basis. Colin underscores the unique way in which Obama not only justifies, but actually encourages vicious hatred and defiance of law enforcement, and we consider how pleas for “unity” and much needed “conversations about race” are merely tactics to cover the root of the problem. Colin also gives plenty of examples of the government’s agenda to drive the numbers of black crime statistics down, including cases of judges rigging the court system and public officials being encouraged to “stand down” and ignore black-on-black crime. Further, we weigh up the insidious aims of the Black Lives Matter movement and the widespread trend of indoctrinating White children to feel guilt and shame for Western culture and the history of slavery. We also look at how blacks are targeting other immigrants in violent crimes and Colin touches on the grim reality of the latest National Crime Victimization Survey.

In the member half, we continue our discussion on the media agenda to paint Whites as oppressive racists, and we ponder the democrat obsession with racial consciousness. Colin gives his take on the militarization of police forces in response to crime waves in larger cities, and he addresses what the call for “better police and community relations” really means considering cops are being discouraged to even defend themselves, such as in the case of July’s Dallas sniper attack. Then, we focus on Europe’s mounting migrant crime epidemic and the resultant cultural destruction that should be ringing the alarm for Americans. Colin stresses how the suicidal behavior of believing the infiltration of hostile invaders is deserved will lead to the complete demise of Western civilization. We get into the problem of Europe aiding and abetting African countries in their quest to infiltrate the most welfare rich Northern European countries, and we also address the rampant sex attacks perpetrated by migrants that have been plaguing Europe and becoming more prevalent in the US. Later, we consider the brain drain that is occurring throughout once prestigious countries like Germany and Sweden as the intelligent indigenous stock makes a break for more friendly opportunities. At the end, we talk about how the US now has radical Islam heaped on top of its collective guilt and Europe is getting its own taste of #BlackLivesMatter.

Title: Germar Rudolf - Persecution of Revisionists & Demographic Disaster
Date: 2016-08-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=4xtdfU6PSBY
Description: Germar Rudolf was born in Limburg, Germany. He studied chemistry at Bonn University, where he graduated in 1989 as a Diplom-Chemist, which is comparable to a U.S. PhD degree. From 1990-1993 he prepared a German PhD thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in conjunction with the University of Stuttgart, Germany. Parallel to this and in his spare time, Rudolf prepared an expert report on chemical and technical questions of the alleged gas chambers of Auschwitz, The Rudolf Report. He is the founder of the small revisionist outlet, Castle Hill Publishers.

Mr. Rudolf joins us to share the story of his life’s work as a revisionist researcher and writer and the ostracizing and persecution he has endured for daring to tread into the controversial topic of the German holocaust. Germar talks about the process of awakening that led him to question the “official” version of holocaust history in his mid-20s, when he stumbled upon the notorious Leuchter Report while preparing an expert report on the chemical and technical questions of the alleged gas chambers of Auschwitz and Birkenau for the trial of a Holocaust “denier.” We discuss the longstanding and brutal suppression of evidences that refute the cherished narrative of gas chambers used to systematically exterminate 6 million Jews, and we look at the undeniable proof that the powers that be have been using this “miracle weapon” to psychologically trounce German and Western European identity. Then, Germar gives a straightforward definition of “revisionist,” underscoring that in the case of the holocaust, the general issues of persecution and unjust treatment of Jews is not denied. He highlights some of the chemical, structural and biological evidence that points to a starkly contrasting story than what has been painted throughout 70+ years of political propagandizing. Germar also touches on the thought crimes that sent him to prison for 44 months and the blatant lawlessness of court proceedings he’s witnessed, and he gives a rundown of his latest book, Resistance is Obligatory.

In the members’ segment, Germar goes deeper into exposing free speech hijacking and human dignity suppression that is at the core of revisionist work. We consider the massive power structure upheaval that would need to occur in order for Western civilization at large to achieve a complete paradigm shift and accept the fact that we have been lied to and manipulated on so many levels concerning WWI/II. We discuss the most critical extinction level crisis that is plaguing Europe – the demographic decline of natives resulting from the shrinking birth rate. Germar emphasizes the financial implications of Europeans allowing themselves to be bred out, and we debate whether or not the government’s (dis)incentivizing having larger families is really the issue. We give some thought to the role of the 1960s sexual revolution, the advent of birth control, and the lost sense awareness that we live in a chain of generations that keeps the social order on course. At the end, we weigh up how the crisis the West is spawning many religious zealots and a rising core of radical traditionalist who may or may not be able to rescue the vanishing European civilization.

Title: Dr. David Duke - Running for Senate
Date: 2016-08-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3YfU0q50d6w
Description: Dr. David Duke is a graduate of Louisiana State University with a BA in History. He pursued a PhD in the largest university in Ukraine and in 2005 completed his Doctoral Defense in Kiev. He is the author of the books “Jewish Supremacism,” “My Awakening” and “The Secret Behind Communism.” Duke, a former member of the House of Representatives from Louisiana, is currently running for US Senate.

There is an audio version available of this interview at redice.tv. Both video segments of this interview is available for Red Ice Members: http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/extra/program.php?id=1159

We begin by briefly touching on Dr. Duke’s return to American politics. He has chosen to run for a number of reasons, including the current awakening taking place among ethnic Europeans in America and the rise of Trump. Duke reminds us that our current plight – namely, that we are being demographically replaced by hostile foreigners – proves that he was correct all along. We then discuss the insanity of modern liberalism and the divisive nature of multiculturalism. Dr. Duke also points out that the egalitarian rhetoric offered by our elite is nothing more than a weapon to destabilize the West and further consolidate power into their hands – as was the case in Communist Russia. We conclude the first hour by talking about the left’s efforts to create a non-White voting bloc, black-on-White violence, and America’s disastrous foreign policy.

In the members hour, we explore the volatile state of race relations in America. Dr. Duke reminds us that, unlike previous threats to the West, our current predicament can be solved peacefully and humanely via the political system. As such, it is of the utmost importance that Dr. Duke is elected.We then discuss the hypocritical nature of identity politics in America. White Europeans, despite being the founding ethnic stock of America, are forbidden from explicitly advocating for their interests; non-Whites, however, are allowed to engage in ruthless ethnic competition without facing any social repercussions. We talk about the fact that supporting Trump – who represents non-White people implicitly, not explicitly – carries such a stigma that many people, such as academics, cannot support him lest they risk ruining their careers. In light of this, Dr. Duke proposes introducing legislation to outlaw discrimination based on political views. Finally, we wrap up by discussion how America has changed for the worse over the past few decades; Dr. Duke, however, remains optimistic that positive change is on its way.

Title: Gilad Atzmon - Turkey’s Failed Coup, Rise of Nationalism & Mammonism
Date: 2016-07-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0DZiaO3H61k
Description: Gilad Atzmon is an Israeli born jazz musician and author that lives and works in England. He is trained in composition and jazz at the Rubin Academy of Music, Jerusalem. He is a member of the Blockheads, founded the Orient House Ensemble in London, and has recorded and performed with many rock music legends. Gilad also writes on political matters, social issues, Jewish identity and culture. Atzmon is the author of The Wandering Who, and A to Zion – The Definitive Israeli Lexicon.

A filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members.
http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/extra/program.php?id=1150

n this episode, Gilad speaks about his understanding of the failed Turkish Coup that followed attempts by Erdogan to reinstate Turkey’s amicable relationship with Russia. Gilad speculates that Turkey is on its way to becoming the new Syria, as it’s on one hand an extremely Nationalist country and on the other at the forefront of the NATO/neocon intervention project. We learn about the uprising and taking to the streets by the Turkish people that stopped the military takeover, which Gilad says has been likened by some to an Islamofascist revolt. Then, we discuss how the Brexit decision relates to a bone of contention for Turkey’s role in the dirty NATO wars and the refugee invasion sprouting out of Eastern Europe. Gilad points out some factors related to the Jewish Bolshevist movement in Russia and the Zionist occupation of Palestine that echo in present patterns being seen in Turkey, and he emphasizes how Erdogan’s popularity is another clear signal of the nationalist uprising and growing awareness of ethnic belonging. We also look at the perils of today’s trade-driven capitalist Britain, which Gilad calls Mammonism, and was predicted nearly 100 years ago by the genius manufacturer and business tycoon Henry Ford.

Title: Roger Devlin - Islamic Spain: A Multicultural Lie & Trump Reboots American Politics
Date: 2016-07-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1PpHOc6860w
Description: F. Roger Devlin, Ph.D. is an independent scholar. He is the author of Alexandre Kojeve and the Outcome of Modern Thought, Sexual Utopia in Power, and many essays and reviews in such publications as The Occidental Quarterly, American Renaissance, Counter-Currents, VDare, Modern Age, The Social Contract, Alternative Right, and The Last Ditch. A bibliography of his work is available online at Devliniana.

In the first hour, Roger discusses his review of The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise: Muslims, Christians, and Jews under Islamic Rule in Medieval Spain by Dario Fernandez-Morera – a book that refutes the glorification and romanticizing of civilizations that have supposedly reached the same pinnacle of success as Western civilizations. Roger outlines Fernandez-Morera’s analysis of the Moorish conquering of Spain that began with the Arab invasion of 711 AD, when towns were brutally massacred under threat of accepting the Koran or the sword. We discuss the Germanic Visigoths who were in control of the Iberian Peninsula during this time frame and had built up a civilization based in the ways of the Roman Empire. We consider how the current Islamic invasion echoes past religious intolerance, as we’re seeing the utopian dream of multiculturalism trampling on the cultural traditions of the West. Roger emphasizes the reality of the Muslim way of thinking in that the religion of Islam has no comprehension of Western values of female self-determination and self-control, and he says their contemptuous view of women is simply a fundamental tenet that cannot be unlearned or assimilated within the West. Roger has long predicted that feminists would be at the forefront of ushering in another Muslim invasion, as their total lack of understanding of the authoritarian nature of the Muslim religion has ironically created a bridge to the destruction and replacement of the liberal values feminists value most.

In the member hour, we get into the current radicalization of US politics and the unraveling of an ideology that can be seen in the common thread of both Trump and Sanders camps demonstrating Americans’ deep dissatisfaction with the status quo. Roger talks about how Trump has managed to coalesce around the Nationalist movement and warns that we will probably see, yet again, just how little power our presidential puppets have over the liberal democrat policymakers. We look at how the Black Lives Matter movement is working in favor of the Trump campaign, along with why the media has decided to turn on the police and blow the issue of violence against blacks completely out of proportion. Roger points to the religion of modern liberalism and the mainstream media’s emotional programming of the uneducated as the root of the demographic decline of America’s founding stock, and we measure up how the doctrine of equality has fooled many into believing that the immigrant collective is interested in adopting the objectivity of White Western liberals. Then, Roger explains how the decay of the bourgeoisie and the rise of the managerial class to power has shaped the ideology of instant gratification and consumerism as manifested in the globalist corporate model and the bureaucratic monstrosity of government. At the end, we turn our thoughts to educating our future generations of leaders on the follies of racial diversity and the importance of preserving the cultural identity.

Title: James Bacque - Other Losses: Death of Millions of German Prisoners After World War II
Date: 2016-07-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gKGQ65guU3o
Description: James Bacque was born and educated at Upper Canada College and Trinity College in Toronto. He has worked in literature and history since he published his first novel The Lonely Ones, in 1969. Other Losses and Crimes and Mercies, both accounts of the astonishing history of the Allied massacres in postwar Germany, have been sold world-wide. His work has been the subject of a book, an academic conference, and many articles and TV documentaries in Canada, the UK, the USA, France and Germany. Bacque has won several literary prizes and awards, including the Bismarck Medal. His new title, Spirit Builders, chronicles the work of Frontiers Foundation in Canada.

In the first hour, James describes the testimonies he uncovered while researching Other Losses: an Investigation into the Mass Deaths of German Prisoners at the Hands of the Americans and the French after World War Two, a book that caused an international scandal when it was first published in 1989. James gives an overview of the largely suppressed stories of the horrific fates suffered by around 11 million German military men and their families who were taken as prisoners by the Allied Forces. We discuss the issue of soldiers being classified as “disarmed enemy forces” that prevented proper inspections of the work camps by the Red Cross and a resulting cover-up of the famine, exposure to harsh elements, and death that occurred. James explains how the Morgenthau Plan was signed off by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill in a plan of vengeance that destroyed occupied German industry and left the country starving and penniless. As these unthinkable events were unfolding, the suppression of truth on threats of worth and livelihood succeeded in sweeping history under the rug – a masquerade that continues to this day. We consider how falsehoods based in “The Good War” have created an unshakable demonization of Germany, and James talks about the overwhelming support and recognition, as well as the stubborn rejection and ridicule, he has received for dismantling this deceitful narrative.

In the member hour, James goes deeper into the death of truth that has left our world to exist on deliberate deceptions, malevolent myths and biased propaganda. He emphasizes how well Germany has managed to recover and succeed despite the people being pinned as evil and having a deeply ingrained self-hatred. We discuss the German green movement that was created during the rise of National Socialism, and we also address concerns for the environment that are being amplified as massive waves of immigration and the worldwide thirst for Western luxuries overwhelms Europe. Then, James talks about the American military draft and the deceitful propaganda that led Canadian WWI & WWII soldiers to believe they were fighting for mercy, justice and truth. We get into the brutal post-war bombing, pillaging and raping of Germany, along with the great resistance to the Allied atrocities that festered from military Generals down to Privates. James brings forth the idea that history does not need to be revised, but rather it needs to actually be written, as much of what we’ve been told is not worth knowing. At the end, we weigh up the massive stigma and ruin that accompanies examining this dreadful period of history, and how to move forward while approaching journalism with a review mirror as we break the spell of weaponized history.

Title: Matt Forney - Culture Clash in the Run Up to the US Election
Date: 2016-07-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oCJUwI6S7AU
Description: Matt Forney is an author, journalist and entrepreneur currently based in Chicago. A native of Syracuse, New York, he has lived in Canada as well as the Philippines, and studied English and journalism at SUNY Plattsburgh and the University at Albany. Forney is a columnist for Return of Kings and Right On, and blogs regularly at his website MattForney.com. Additionally, he is the author of the self-help guide “Confessions of an Online Hustler” and several other books.

In the first hour, Matt joins us to discuss the culture clash that is casting a dark cloud over the US. We talk about our crucial task as independent journalists to cover and document these crazy times in order to preserve the truth of how history is unfolding. Matt breaks down some of the strange anomalies seen in the video of convicted child molester Alton Sterling being apprehended and killed by Baton Rouge police. The funding by (((George Soros))) of the #blacklivesmatter movement is illuminated, along with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim’s manipulation of the US media to promote illegal immigrant amnesty. We connect the dots between Hillary Clinton’s fervent push for gun control and Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s “Summer of Chaos” scheme that has been revealed through hacked messages between BLM leader Doray McKesson and Johnetta Elzie, which mention bringing on Martial Law by causing chaos at the upcoming Republican National Convention in Cleveland, and thus extending Obama’s presidential term. Then, Matt explains the inner workings of leftist pathologies, namely the rampant narcissism that has created a culture of microaggression-triggered, codependent degenerates. We examine how this largely liberal hive mind mentality has shaped a society around the lowest common denominator, where traditional values of female femininity, male masculinity, nuclear family, and physical and mental fitness are intolerable. Further, we weigh up how the Clinton/Sanders schism has divided the left on identity politics and economic issues, along with indications that Trump is enticing many of these confused voters to the Republican camp.

Title: Cathedral Princess - Women & The Alt-Right: The Awakened White Female - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-07-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=UORKtp-eD2k
Description: Cathedral Princess is the co-host of TheRightStuff.biz podcast, Fash Britannia, which is currently on hiatus due to Britain’s tightening chokehold on free speech.

In this episode, Cathy describes just how stifling the politically correct climate of Britain has become in terms of freedom of speech and expression, as the establishment works diligently to pave the road for the Islamification of Europe. We discuss Sadiq Khan’s move to outlaw “demeaning” advertisements featuring beautiful, fit European women, which ironically illustrates how Muslims are using the plump feminist rhetoric of the left to promote their own misogynistic ideals. We weigh up the average British attitude toward the EU multicult experiment and possible outcomes for the Brexit vote. Cathy gives her take on the rationale behind the atomized political leanings of typical leftwing females, and we consider what makes nationalistic women operate more like a tribe centered on sisterhood and the nuclear family. Further, we get into the question of how to unlock White women from their delusional liberal programming, and we touch on the rumor that the Alt-Right has been infiltrated by homosexuals and woman haters. Then, we look at the difference between European nationalism and the White nationalism mainly espoused in the US. We round off the hour with some thoughts on the resurgence of paganism and pre-Christian spirituality that is bringing nationalist folk around to a better understanding of the importance of ancestral honor and natural order.

Title: Mike Enoch, Seventh Son - The (((Echo))) Can Be Heard In Orlando - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-07-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=zW0nm2tX0As
Description: Mike Enoch and Seventh Son are behind TheRightStuff.biz - a political and cultural blog aimed at reinvigorating dialogue among a disparate and edgy right-wing and rustling jimmies among the childish and regressive left-wing. Their weekly podcast, The Daily Shoah, infuses edgy humor to touch on current events and politics.

Mike and Seventh Son join us following a couple of honored tributes to the Alt-Right – a massive troll on the mainstream press and the Anti-Defamation League adding a new hate symbol to their list, the ((( ))). The Daily Shoah was brought to the world’s attention after Mic.com credited the anti-Semitic podcast for originating the (((echo))), a symbol used to visually represent their signature Semite sound effect. This inspired the (((coincidence detector))) Google Chrome tracking ap that was recently shoahed for violating “hate speech policy” and the resultant “reclaiming” of the parenthesis by various brave Jews across social medialand. Mike explains the fine points and powerful effects of shitposting, trolling and LARPing, and we look at how liberals are getting their cherished reverse psychology systematically flipped on their own whiny asses while their outplayed taboo/boundary breaking/rejection of traditionalism is now the picture of dull normiedom. Seventh Son emphasizes how the convoluted ideologies of “conservatives” and “liberals” have both become the gold standard for the mainstream and elite consensuses, and now ironically appeal to those who are inherently the most authoritarian and intolerant. Then, we touch on the Orlando nightclub mass shooting and the fact that the Democrats are pro-Islam, which empirically represents anti-gay, making the event a valuable wedge issue for derailing the deranged tolerance narrative. We round off with some stabs at the cucked crying and libard logic that twists gun control, homophobia, US foreign policy and Islamaphobia into one big knot of blame for the world’s problems.

Title: Janice Fiamengo - How Academic Feminism Wrecks Women - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-07-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=c4NsghrM7qs
Description: Janice Fiamengo is a Professor of English at the University of Ottawa in Ontario, Canada. Recently she has begun to speak out on men's issues, having become appalled by the bigotry, hypocrisy, and dangerous magical thinking of the modern feminist movement. She is the author of The Fiamengo File, a series of YouTube videos on academic feminism, the situation of men in modern culture, and free speech. She has published numerous essays on feminism and cultural decline at PJ Media and FrontPage Magazine.

A filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members.
http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/extra/program.php?id=1115

Janice is with us to deconstruct how academic feminism is contributing to the ongoing destruction of Western society. She begins by illustrating the climate on college campuses, where the myth of oppressed and marginalized women, vulnerable in a patriarchal world, yet morally superior to men, somehow deserve special protection and privileges to level the playing field. Janice describes the anti-male, anti-nature Marxist narrative permeating women’s and gender studies, which attributes all cultural ills to the evils of masculinity while denying any significant biological basis to gender differences. She gives examples of radical feminist members of Canada’s Revolutionary Student Movement hijacking discussions attempting to address men’s issues, the transformation of female consciousness stemming from misleading data about the West’s supposed rape culture, and other studies that pin men as the sole source of society’s iniquities. We look at why feminists refuse to align with the victims of Muslim supremacy and how the hierarchy of victimhood excuses the barbaric treatment of Muslim women by pointing the finger of blame at White Western males. Janice relates how the victim mentality oozing out of leftist led university classrooms ties to the introduction of various identity studies in the ‘70s, and she talks more about her personal lambasting for daring to speak critically of feminism’s role in the disempowerment of White Western males. We round off the hour by touching on the controlled media’s demonization of Western values and multicultural utopia propaganda, along with what can be done to defeat the mental virus of feminism to restore humanity’s natural order.

Title: Arthur Kemp - March of the Titans: The Rise & Fall of Caucasian Civilization - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-07-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Gf5LRUiGnjA
Description: Arthur Kemp was born in Southern Rhodesia in 1962. Educated in South Africa, he holds a degree in Political Science, International Politics and Public Administration, having studied at the University of Cape Town and the University of South Africa. He is the owner of Ostara Publications and the author of eleven books, including March of the Titans: The Complete History of the White Race.

Arthur joins us for a look at how the aspects of racial homogeneity and racial disillusionment (multiculturalism) have historically contributed to the rise and fall of civilizations. We begin by considering the essential questions of what causes culture and what happens when a civilization’s creators vanish. Arthur talks about the misconceptions of early English colonialism and the vastly different process of mass foreign invasion transpiring in the West today. He addresses the proclivity of the White race to explore the world and provide humanitarian support to the less fortunate, along with the consequences of these interventions. We discuss some logistics of the Out of Africa theory and the role of environment in racial differences, touching on the bureaucratic baloney that thwarts modern day archaeologists from properly investigating tremendous troves of ancient human remains holding clues of Europeans’ origins in the Northern Hemisphere. Then, Arthur explains the dire reality of the population replacement events being orchestrated by the West’s rulers, and we deliberate how to wake up the ill-informed masses to their looming extinction. Kemp also gives an account of his life in South Africa during the ANC’s takeover, relating the hard fact that demographics ultimately dictate the rules. Our conversation rounds off with thoughts on the viability of recruiting quality Europeans to create a great ethnostate and the terrific potential that exists when enough Whites are able to unlearn their self-defeatist programming and abandon the egalitarian fantasies driving their cultures to demise.

Title: Lady LaSSarus - Pro White is Pro Woman. Feminism is Anti-White - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-07-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=aVfdPWc1Kcs
Description: Lady LaSSarus is a traditionalist, wife and aspiring mother from the deep mountain South who wishes to unite the ladies of the Traditionalist/Alt-Right movement. She is opposed to feminism, Cultural Marxism, and Critical Theory.

Lady LaSSarus joins us for a discussion about feminism, women’s matters, and the Alt-Right. We begin with a look into her awakening to the cultural Marxist slant on race issues in the US, which was brought to light through working with Chicago’s south side public school system. Lady LaSSarus gives her views on Trump and the great traction he is receiving as Americans fed up with the crumbling economy and degradation caused by never-ending 3rd world immigration are finally taking a stand. We look at some liberal misconceptions about the viability of multiculturalism and upholding European ideals that are centered on homogeneous, high-trust societies. We also touch on the growing movement of women in the Alt-Right scene and how we can bring more traditionalist-minded females into the fold. We consider how sly feminist programming has created several generations of misguided mothers who have naïvely subjected their daughters to anti-woman and anti-White conditioning, and we delve into ways to reestablish the natural balance of male/female relationships and inspire true veneration of motherhood. Lady LaSSarus shares the steps she has taken to get back to a more Eurocentric way of life and gives inspiring examples of this budding trend. At the end, we lay out some guidelines for connecting with likeminded individuals and tips for men to attract a great Alt-Right soul mate.

Title: Angelo John Gage - Making Europeans Great Again - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-07-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=JQQzTQUxa1k
Description: Angelo John Gage is a political activist who is fighting against Marxism in all its abominable forms. A former US Marine, Gage went on to graduate from the International Center for Positive Change and Hypnosis as a NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) Master Practitioner and Conversational Hypnotist. Angelo helped found and was Chairman of National Youth Front during 2015. He is now concentrating on making our men great again with Resurgence Media Network. 

The filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members. 

http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/extra/program.php?id=1106

Angelo returns to R3F to talk about joining forces with RMN and to fill us in on some of the events that prompted a major shift in his political activism. Gage says the truth alone is not enough to get the masses motivated and he explains how he is using his NLP and life-coaching knowledge to focus on a winning strategy that will inspire people to recognize the enemy within instead of blaming external factors for society’s shortcomings. We discuss effective ways to deliver this message and positively promote the Nationalist movement, and Angelo highlights the main points addressed in his Full Spectrum Dominance strategy. He touches on the troubles with truth seekers getting ensnared in the Jew trap, and we look at how to restore natural order for Europeans by rediscovering roots and embracing Identitarian ideology. We get into Trump’s pull to White interests and his ability to attract broad support from Americans through a simple, hard-hitting and emotionally appealing style. Then, we weigh up the negative stereotypes that have arisen out of the White Nationalist scene, and Angelo lays out what the Alt Right movement can do to counteract the race baiting game being fueled by “Semitic sorcerers.” Later, we look at the feasibility of White secession and Pan-European nationalism considering the vast ethnic diversity that exists within the West. At the end, Gage illuminates the motivating force behind RMN – a return to traditionalism headed by strong men working together towards practical solutions for the future of Europeans.

Title: James Bowery - Sortocracy & Meta-Government: A New Spiritual System
Date: 2016-07-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_QhI_oCUCAc
Description: James Bowery is an American IT pioneer who descends from Scotch-Irish ancestry, with the patriline geographically concentrated in Groningen, Netherlands. He is the architect of Sorotocracy.org

James is with us to share his outline for a new spiritual system, which he calls Sortocracy – “a form of meta-government whose purpose is to render it practical for consenting adults to form their own government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness.” James talks about the life-changing spiritual experience that brought him to the awareness that not all cultures have the same moral sensibility, and respecting the differing moral agencies found around the globe is what truly ennobles us as diverse nations. We talk about the hijacking of Christianity from the top down by evil forces, looking at how congregations are being subverted against their wills through forced engagement with refugee resettlement programs. James then goes into some details about his work in the IT field involving the streamlining of high grade food production. Later, we discuss the main tenets of Sorotocracy, including rigorous borders to exclude outsiders, strict rules and punishments for law breakers, and the allowance for sovereign men to maintain the order of societies through exercising free will and individual judgement. James relates all this and more as to humankind’s rootedness in the primordial experience of creation and nature, the awareness of which has been largely sacrificed as respect for men and the creators of our civilization have been abandoned.

During the member hour we discuss more of James’ proposals for Sorotocracy and he ties in the work of Edward O. Wilson, who wrote “The Social Conquest of Earth.” We consider developments of Europeans as a eugenic culture, with key components being sexual selections based on individual integrity, and also the coevolution with domesticated wolves that taught man the law of the alpha male. We look at the contrasting behaviors of cultures evolving with more dependence on group cohesion rather than individual merits during the time Earth has been dominated by eusocial animals. Then, James illuminates the idea that we need to uncover the knowledge from our ancient shaman ancestors who had deep connections to the paranormal side of nature. We discuss the current degenerative state of our warring world and why the invasions of European lands by more warlike tribes who wish to impose their moral structures clearly signals war is here and it’s our duty to organize and conquer. Further, James addresses the multiracial potential of Sorotocracy, emphasizing that this is possible only through honoring societal laws and agreements. He also delves into how the imposition of politically correct, weaponized rhetoric has broken down our natural power structures that were historically held together by the ability to act with force. At the end, we get into the scary potential of governments taking over the role of reproduction, and how the march toward globalization is threatening the earth’s ecosystems.

Title: Mark Collet - Brexit: The EU will Destroy Britain & the European People
Date: 2016-07-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=poxhG6jlGIM
Description: Mark Collett has been involved in Nationalist politics his entire adult life. He is the former chairman of the Young BNP, the youth division of the British National Party (BNP). Later, Collett was Director of Publicity for the BNP and designed the campaign material that won the party a seat on the Greater London Assembly, two seats in the European Parliament and dozens of local councilors. In the past two months Mark has been hard at work promoting the Leave campaign for the forthcoming EU Referendum in Britain.

Mark joins us for an important dialogue about the upcoming Brexit vote and the promising Leave decision that must occur in order for Britain to free itself of the bureaucratic dictatorship of the EU and regain its national sovereignty. We discuss the undemocratic nature of the EU and the £350 million per week that is spent by Britain on a membership that curtails rights to control its own borders, protect its own resources, make its own laws and manage its own industries. Mark underscores the crucial problem of the EU Schengen Zone that allows throngs of unchecked 3rd world migrants, including hostile terrorists, to seep through Britain’s main access artery at the Calais tunnel. This issue is compounded by lax rules on asylum seekers that allow families of ‘refugees’ to be reunited within the borders of host countries, causing enormous influx and placing unmanageable stress on hospitals, schools and infrastructure while creating a horrible culture clash as the White working class of Britain is replaced by unrecognizable enclaves incapable of assimilation. Mark describes the insanity of the politicians pushing this multicult agenda of White genocide and the sneaky media programming that has a society of self-loathing Brits believing in the follies of White privilege and vibrant diversity. Then, we look at the important role that parties like UKIP are playing in legitimizing the message of reclaiming Britain’s sovereignty and control over the failed policies of the left.

In the members’ segment, we examine the unique flavor of ethnomasochism that makes Europeans particularly susceptible to anti-White brainwashing. Mark reminds us how the wondrous technological advancements developed by Europeans are now being employed as weapons of mass destruction against us, as the discordance of diversity splits cohesive communities into selfish, self-hating, guilt-ridden zombies huddled indoors, living on steady diets of media mental poison and processed garbage foods. Mark says this unnatural state can be chalked up to society’s overall divorce from nature, which is clearly illustrated in the rise of depression, anxiety, and mental malaise, the unprecedented volume of pharmaceutical drug consumption, and the number of degenerate role models that are propped up to further muddle the definition of wellbeing for our impressionable youth. Further, we look at the confusion and degradation being caused from touting the line that “everyone is a winner” and protecting children from dealing with any kind of defeat. We also consider how the West’s legacy of high-trust societies has resulted in a weakened culture preoccupied with consuming creature comforts, while the environmental strain this causes is completely forgotten. At the end, we get into the steps that must be taken for Brits and Europeans to eradicate corrupt law makers and police forces, regain control of our governments, and secure genuine nationalist representatives of our communities.

Title: Filip Dewinter, Sam Van Rooy - Flemish independence & Islamization of Europe
Date: 2016-06-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vynyb9Hc9CA
Description: Filip Dewinter is a member of the Flemish Parliament and one of the leading members of Vlaams Belang, a Flemish nationalist party in the Flanders Region and Brussels of Belgium. He is the author of “Inch’Allah? The Islamization of Europe.” Sam Van Rooy is a spokesman for Vlaams Belang and the author and co-editor of “Islam: Critical Essays on Political Religion,” and “Europe Falters: The Abduction of Europe by the EU.”

Filip and Sam join us to talk about the nationalist force in Western Europe that is steadily expanding in response to its cultural and demographic transformation wrought from over 40 years of Islamic intrusion. The gentlemen address the main focus of Vlaams Belang, which deals with issues of Flemish independence, opposition to multiculturalism, and defense of traditional Western values. We learn how Belgium was artificially created in 1830 as a buffer zone between Germany and France, essentially erasing the identity of the ancient Flemish culture in order to serve the interests of England and Germany. We discuss Brexit and the potential for a powerful domino effect to bust open the doors for other European countries that wish to be free of the EU’s bureaucratic clutches. Filip illustrates the cultural and economic devastation that has been caused by open borders and the refusal of the EU elites to recognize Islam’s intent for world domination, and we look at the role the multicultural project plays in intensifying Jihadi attacks like those seen in Paris and Brussels, and most recently Orlando. We consider how the liberal left has been complicit in the “tyranny of guilt” that appeases Muslim incompatibility within Western civilization – a perversion pronounced most poignantly in London’s recent mayoral election of the Muslim member of the socialist Labour Party, Sadiq Khan. Sam talks about the growing negative sentiments of Europeans who are fed up with their traditional Western family values being assaulted and marginalized, and he emphasizes the value of propagandizing a patriotic revival. We also discuss the financial motives behind the elite’s ideology of mass immigration and the brainwashing that has yielded a shrinking indigenous birth rate and an explosion of invader offspring. At the end, we weigh up the crucial tasks of breaking free from the chains of cultural nihilism and reinvigorating the fertile youth to produce enough descendants to get the 3rd world and Islam off the West’s back yet again.

Title: Daniel, GW, Kumiko - Brexit: Time for the UK to Leave the EU
Date: 2016-06-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oFa-WcazYC0
Description: Guessedworker (GW) is an English nationalist in favor of international nationalism. Having lived in 1950s era Britain, he has since seen his nation undermined by neo-liberalism and Jewish-inspired leftism. He created Majorityrights.com in 2004 as a forum to find solutions for the myriad of problems facing not only the British people, but all European peoples as well. Kumiko Oumae is the Eurasian affairs contributor for Majorityrights.com. She believes that in order for Europe to control its own destiny – and for it to be a good trade and global development partner for Asian countries – there must be a serious dialogue on Europe's historical role in the world and the justification of that role, as well as how the European states can resolve the crisis of legitimacy that their governments are presently facing. Kumiko also works in the security and defense sector in the United Kingdom. An ex-pat American of European descent, Daniel Sienkiewicz now lives in Europe. He has been troubled by the implications of "anti-racism" and has been testing various means to advocate for European peoples for as long as he can remember. Daniel rejects many common approaches, including all characteristically Cartesian attempts, such as scientism, as ineffective means to solve the problems that currently threaten ethnic Europeans.

We begin by discussing Brexit and its significance in the ongoing struggle between nationalism and internationalism. Kumiko argues that, in many ways, the current economic paradigm in the West isn’t quite internationalism proper, but rather the United States being allowed to dominate due to passivity on behalf of the European Union. Despite a few minor disagreements, all three guests adamantly support withdrawal from the European Union. We then discuss the original vision of the European Union – that of a unified, more prosperous Europe – and how the elites therein have sabotaged that vision by allowing in millions of non-European immigrants. Later, we talk about the unfortunate lack of patriotism within certain European countries. We conclude this episode with a discussion on the manner in which the mainstream media has used the murder of Jo Cox as an excuse to those in favor of Brexit.

Title: James Sears - Your Ward News: Battling Canadian Marxism with Humor
Date: 2016-06-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5c87ttHZIBA
Description: Dr. James Sears is the leader of the New Constitution Party of Canada, a medical doctor by training, and Editor-In-Chief of “Your Ward News.” He is an advocate for male masculinity and provides one-to-one coaching for men looking to hone their skills in the taming of the FemiMarxist shrew, and James is also a top Canadian medical fraud and malpractice investigator.

Dr. Sears joins us for a discussion about various free speech issues in Canada and his activism as Editor-In-Chief of the largest anti-Marxist publication in the world, "Your Ward News," which is delivered each month by Canada Post to 305,000 addresses in Toronto, and read by over one million people. Due to controversy surrounding YWN’s content and distribution, Sears has been the subject of more hate crime investigations than any other person in Canadian history. James describes his recent tangle with Judy Foote, the Minister of Public Services, who, after “believing” that YWN would commit a future act of circulating defamatory libel, issued a bogus “Prohibitory Order” that strips rights to postal service from Sears and the newspaper’s main affiliates. We get into the issue of censorship in context to humor and how Marxists twist their dogma to inflate victimization narratives – from the holohoax to #blackliesmatter, feminist hysteria and the tranny agenda. Then, James dishes the dirt on Warren Kinsella, the Canadian Liberal Party “strategist” trying to shut down YWN, along with pro-Israel, Evangelical Christian radio host Andrew Lawton, who compares Sears to "George Galloway” and “Hamas.” These absurd connections sadly illustrate the sheer denseness of looney liberal logic, which Dr. Sears has experienced extensively in scads of unhinged responses to his frequently misinterpreted, provocative parody pieces.

For the members’ hour, we focus on the growing wave of Westerners who have honed in on the Zio-Marxist controlled garbage narrative that has run its course in destroying natural order. James describes where he sees the tide dramatically turning amongst young kids who are embracing Nationalism as the bullshit education/indoctrination machine crumbles under the weight of overturned sacred cows, forced diversity and illogical identity politics. Then, Sears talks about his masculinity agenda, which he is spearheading through education for men about the harmful effects of the testosterone disrupting plastics in our environments and feminizing phytoestrogens prominently found in foods cherished by vegans. James introduces the trollworthy characters, Dimitri the Lover and SeXXXy Eddy, who he created to expose how the problem of artificially deactivated testosterone amongst Occident men is working in conjunction with the flood of oversexualized, aggressive immigrants who are getting the Kalergi red carpet treatment from our treasonous elite. We get into the questions of culture, race and tribe loyalty in the Nationalist movement, and how to make the ideology more attractive to women through assertiveness and brute force. We wrap by assessing the MSM response to the June 12 Orlando nightclub massacre – another glaring example of warped liberal “tolerance” for the despicable actions of certain victim classes in lieu of universal moral standards.

Title: Andrew Fraser - The Wasp Question
Date: 2016-06-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=dt7UZH5m37M
Description: Andrew Fraser studied both law and history in Canada and the United States. After moving to Australia, he taught legal history and constitutional law at Macquarie University in Sydney. He is the author The WASP Question .(Arktos 2011) and the forthcoming Dispatches from the Divinity School.

Andrew joins us for a compelling look into The WASP Question, which addresses the lost sense of ethnic identity of Anglo-Saxon peoples in Western civilization. Drew talks about his views on multiculturalism and feminism that triggered various controversies at Macquarie University and the impetus for writing his book. He cites the English covenantal character and the development of the law of the contract as key features responsible for WASP’s ability to thrive economically and develop into a unified polity. We examine why the island of England has been historically targeted for invasion and subjugation, and how the Danes, Normans, Vikings, Dutch and Scandinavians managed to be absorbed despite the clashing ways of English Christians and Nordic pagans. Drew describes the pivotal time during the 17th century Civil War when English identity became defined by law and mercantilism, and we look at how the rise of civic nationalism in the new world order age of widespread immigration within the West led to the corrosion of WASP identity. Further, Drew gives his take on the postmodern rebirth of Anglo Saxon Christendom and the Trinitarian nature of race, ethnicity and theology, and how the now globalist Anglican church should be nurturing a sense of common ethnic identity. He also points to the US’s “cult of constitution” as being responsible for its abandonment of religious identity, resulting a theological issue that must be addressed for WASP survival. 

In the members’ segment, Drew talks more about his ethno-theological approach to the WASP question and his case for the proposition that Christianity is a religion grounded in ethnic identity. He argues that the stories in the bible, from Genesis through Revelations, refer to a particular people and are guides for what it means to be a holy nation. We discuss the Catholic church’s betrayal of the European people and its exacerbation of the refugee crisis through the adoption of Unitarianism. We go back to the creation of the protestant Anglican church by Alfred the Great and the relationship between the English state and the papal monarchy. Drew illuminates the emergence of Judaeo-Christianism, the missing link of modern Jews to ancient Israelites, the ending of the covenant with old Israel in AD 70, and the Synagogue of Satan. Then, we look at the rise of globalist Zionism since WWII and the JQ factor in the decline of Western Christianity, along with the unacceptable turning of the other cheek by liberals to the horrific war crimes by the “chosen ones.” Drew says the “Trumpening” in the US is a positive sign that the narrative is being rewritten, but the unsustainable perpetual economic growth paradigm could result in a new dark age where tribal identity will be a crucial. In conclusion, Drew gives his perspectives on the role feminism plays in pathological altruism and on the effects of multiculturalism in Australia.

Title: Vox Day and Cynic In Chief - The SJW List, The ((( Coincidence ))) & The Cuckservative
Date: 2016-06-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5Kcg6P_BOrc
Description: Vox Day is a writer, a professional game designer and a three-time Billboard top 40 recording artist. He is the author of SJWs Always Lie: Taking Down the Thought Police and Cuckservative: How "Conservatives" Betrayed America. Cynic In Chief is a professional computer programmer, founder of SJWList.com, and amateur poll stalker. When not sitting in front of a computer, he can be found travelling, riding roller coasters, hiking, and caving.

Note: Due to an unknown audio issue, the recording became damaged around the 48 minute mark. We decided to leave it in. We apologize for the technical error. We’re working on making sure it doesn’t happen again in future recordings. Thanks for your understanding.

In this episode, Vox and Cynic In Chief plug the SJW List, a complete catalog of Social Justice Warriors created to help SJW-converged organizations locate and identify Social Justice Warriors they wish to hire or otherwise support. ;-) This list names people and companies that have actively engaged in the brand of dastardly groveling designed to target and sully the reputations of individuals who fail to abide by the SJW code of conduct. Cynic talks about some common tactics that so-called conservatives and mentally unstable lefties employ in proselytizing their ever-mutating narrative, and we look at how the Alt-Right’s technological edge has proved effective in exposing the weak links in the narrow opinion corridor of the politically correct. Vox lays out the modern roots of conservatism and explains how liberal democrats managed to transform the republican party during the hippie era, and the guys describe the main concerns of the right: Nationalism, Western Civilization and Winning. In closing, we discuss the best methods for derailing any SJW attack, Vox highlights his latest book, Cuckservative, and we get into modes of actively participating in the Alt-Right movement.

Title: Julian Langness - Fistfights with Muslims in Europe
Date: 2016-06-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Jj19e71mZgk
Description: Julian Langness writes about European politics, 4th Generation Warfare, identity, masculinity, and society. He regularly contributes articles to a range of websites including Traditional Right and Counter-Currents, and is also the editor of EuropeanCivilWar.com. Langness is the author of Fistfights With Muslims In Europe: One Man’s Journey Through Modernity.

In this discussion, Julian takes us through events during his pilgrimage to his ancestral lands in Norway and extended encounters in Europe over a five-year period in the early 2000s that inspired him to pen his first book, Fistfights With Muslims. These travels led to Julian’s awakening to what it means to be a man in the modern Western world and the dichotomy of Islam and Middle-Eastern culture. We discuss the fact that violence has been largely bred out of Western culture in this age of prosperity where feminized, cultural Marxists males rule, yet the natural impulse for danger and existential challenge remains in the hearts and minds of the majority of ordinary men. Julian relates how many 2nd and 3rd generation Muslims in Europe live with a sense of deracination and disconnectedness from their own tribal identity, and as new Muslim transplants reject assimilation in a culture consumed by decadent pacifism, there is no wonder most hold steadfast to the narrative that evil Whites deserve to be be conquered. Further, Julian talks about the tactics of 4th generation warfare and what he calls the ‘suicidalism’ of the governing elites in Western Europe that are zealously championing for their own destruction.

In the member half, we look at the West’s rapidly shifting demographics and the grim reality of the plummeting promise of Whites in terms of their low birth rates, indoctrinated self-hatred, abandonment of religion, and the rise of nihilism. We discuss the glimmer of hope arising out of countries like Sweden, where rape and violent crime has finally gotten to such a horrific state that a few vigilante groups are emerging to protect their folk and territory. Then, Julian explains the concept of C4ISR structures – a command apparatus that was utilized during the American Revolutionary War that allowed high ranking elite freemasons to communicate and strategize – a template that can be mirrored in the event that our suicidal governments do lead Western Europe into civil war. Langness highlights an article he wrote for Counter Currents where he hypothesizes what’s in store if Muslims and Europeans engage in an all-out 4GW conflict, which is already being predicated through the increasingly chaotic state brought on by the invasion and delegitimized state of the standing government. At the end, we consider how a complete collapse could be the destructive force and shared struggle that is needed to reinvigorate the masculine force required for the Europe to triumph over Islam.

Title: Jason Jorjani - Prometheus and Atlas
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=hpJ8CidZqf4
Description: Jason Reza Jorjani, PhD is a native New Yorker and Iranian-American of Persian and Northern European descent. After receiving his BA and MA at New York University, he completed his doctorate in Philosophy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Jorjani currently teaches Science, Technology, and Society (STS) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He is the author of Prometheus and Atlas (Arktos, 2016). Dr. Jorjani is also a member of the Iranian Renaissance movement.

Dr. Jorjani joins us for an enlightening overview of Prometheus and Atlas, a book essentially describing a coming scientific revolution that would move civilization past the current Cartesian paradigm through a reordering of society and politics. Jason brings forth his idea of a ‘spectral revolution,’ which calls for a conscious recognition of the often suppressed and marginalized research on psychical phenomena such as clairvoyance and telekinesis. We discuss CIA funded parapsychology (psi) studies at Stanford Research Institute on remote viewing and the destabilizing effects on society that could result from mainstream recognition of this human ability to transcend time and space. Jason underscores how the existence of psychic capabilities in the animal kingdom and in primitive tribes proves that human ESP is not just a supernatural phenomenon, but an atrophied human ability, as evidenced by the sophistication of ancient civilizations. Then, Jason illuminates the Greek archetype of Prometheus, the creator god of the Aryans who steals fire from Olympus to bring the light of knowledge to the human race and whose abilities of anticipatory projection are embodied in the European spirit of exploration and discovery. We trace through the tale of Atlas, brother of Prometheus and bearer of the celestial sphere, whose mythic burden is connected to the aesthetic idea of atlases, models, charts and maps of all kinds. Jason also details the rise and fall of Atlantis and its hybridized demigods who acted as stewards over the cosmopolitan knowledge they seeded across the ancient world, and we frame these primeval myths within the context of modern colonialism and technological advancement.

In the member segment, we delve into the suppression of the spectral and the ordering of binary oppositions. Jason defines the nature of ordering chaos in terms of craftsmanship and fine art, illustrating how the tone and mode of societies is set by poets, artists and architects. We look at the need for a global regulatory mechanism that can be applied across the powers of technology, governing an order that avoids negative diversity while revering genuine human psi capabilities and using a biomechanical approach. Jason summarizes “Worlds at War Over Earth,” a chapter in Prometheus and Atlas that addresses the question of religion, the materialistic nature of humans, and the soulless sciences that have been aided in propagation by the church. We discuss the state of the folk as a total work of art, in that the cultivation of an animalistic relationship to the truth is reflected in art, thus setting the cultural tone. Then, Jason delineates the fundamental reasons why Islam has no place in a world governed by Atlas and consciously embracing the Promethean spirit, and he talks about the stage of decadence, decline and disintegration that has been set by liberal values and capitalism. Further, we get into Nietzsche’s criticisms of liberalism and his idea of three modes of history – antiquarian, monumental, and critical. Jason also explains the concepts of archeofuturism and Mercurial hermeneutics, and we consider the vast body of ancient wisdom manipulated and destroyed during the rise of Abrahamic religions. At the end, we discuss possibilities of advanced, otherworldly intelligence manipulating the human race and some bizarre close encounters that suggest we’re dealing with a cosmic trickster using black humor to help us realize the potential of a full spectral revolution.

The filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members.
http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/radio/program.php?id=1114

To begin, Nathan highlights his involvement with National Youth Front and the circumstances that led him to disband the organization and form the entirely new model for Identity Evropa. He gives a brief account of his Marine Corps tours in Iraq and his rough reentry into civilian life that prompted a very deep and disturbing investigation into the origins of Middle East conflicts, thus connecting him to the vein of human biological and genetic diversity. Then, Nathan recaps the Identity Evropa engagement at UC Berkeley where he, Richard Spencer, Johnny Monoxide, and other supporters created a ‘safe space’ in Sproul Plaza for discussions about race and White interests. This demonstration marks a significant milestone of publically challenging the cultural Marxist dominated social sciences and humanities departments throughout Western academia. It has also opened up a fresh platform for continued conversations on the viability and consequences of the culture of equality/diversity that is overrepresented in liberal institutions. Nathan talks about the momentum IE is enjoying as Trump continues to channel the discontent of marginalized Americans of European descent into a renewed interest in the preservation of their heritage and interests.

In the members’ hour, Nathan delves into the political angle of Identity Evropa and the organization’s strategies for networking with politicians who want to get involved in the movement. We look at the drastic shifting of America’s demographics and what the current mass movements of POC to European nations represents for the destiny of the planet at large. We also consider the responsibility Whites have as effective stewards of the wealth and technology that has afforded the West its attractive luxuries and freedoms. Then, Damigo emphasizes the crucial aspect of tackling these challenges with positivity and constructive energy, and he outlines how to disarm some of the seriousness and frame conversations that will entice new people to come into the fold of understanding. Furthermore, he gives examples of these valuable tactics in action during the Berkeley engagement, underscoring the great tools of evoking negative labels on detractors and pointing out the double standards of deconstructing European identity. At the end, we touch on Identity Evropa’s core motive of providing role models for the vast numbers of youth who are discovering the Alt Right and seeking out guidance in the cause.

Title: Tough Love - The Western Tradition, Art Activism & The Pursuit of The Real
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=e1qCFOsHBSE
Description: Tough Love is an artist and blogger from New Zealand who writes from a Eurocentric perspective on his blog ToughLoveLetters. He makes regular solo exhibitions of paintings that deal with Abstract Language and the history of Western Painting. Tough Love has been making art since he was young and pursued it at a tertiary level, which led to technical and teaching positions in the field. Recently he has turned his attention towards the notion of art activism from a New Right perspective.

Tough Love joins us for a deep deliberation on the powerful weapon of art and its potential to combat the degenerate penetration of the left dominated art sphere. He delves into his battle with the disillusionment reaped from New Zealand’s liberal education system and how he pushed on to establish a unique art process that coincided with his breakthrough into the Alt Right realm. We discuss how modern art has chewed away at the history of Western civilization’s traditional foundations, leaving behind a hollowed out version of true artistry. Tough Love describes how the advent of photography transformed classical painting techniques of creating realistic, stylized images, breaking through the boundaries of space, light and tonal modulation producible by a camera. We look at the role of industrialization and mechanization in moving painting away from representing more logical extensions of real space and time towards reductionism and the removal of traditional elements, which is mirrored in the current era’s egalitarian inclinations. Further, Tough Love relates how modern artists like Pollock, Picasso and Warhol influenced the collapsing of boundaries between art and life by bringing the forces of the physical universe into dictating the art form.

In the members’ hour, Tough Love gets into using the mechanism of art to confront the system that has attacked tradition and remedying our post-modern amnesia for the veritable language of art. He says that the best works of art are ones that can naturally link back into their history, offering a visual dialogue that goes beyond just the critique of culture. We discuss the iconic Warhol prints and their representation of the mass production process that defined a new ability of making art out of any image. Then, Tough Love goes on to define the high stakes of making art that emulates the classic masters, as well as what it takes to seize the attention of a viewer to create a jarring experience, and he addresses the challenging aspects of revitalizing great Western creative traditions considering the total leftwing hijacking of the Avant guard. Later, we touch on some grotesque and bizarre things considered to be art, along with the overrepresentation of degeneracy and oppression. At the end, we look at how we can use the tools we already have in place to restore and rejuvenate the quality of contemporary art to yield sophisticated messages that pack the right punch and inspire greatness.

Title: Jeff Wilkerson - Sion's Army: The Freemasons
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3toUTUYuZ4M
Description: After graduating from university in 1977, Jeff Wilkerson was drawn in the direction of political activism. He became a leader in the Populist Party and a member of the National Alliance. His activism slowed in the early millennial years as he married and started a family. In 2008, he began researching for his first book, Sion's Army - The Freemasons, which he published in 2015.

Jeff discusses the exploits of the followers of the shadowy Priory of Sion and explains how they schemed to spin a web of intrigue in their pursuit of world domination, ultimately inventing their own form of Freemasonry to be used as their private army. He'll provide a historical scope of Sion’s Army starting with the early history of Judaism and ending with the defeat of Napoleon. Jeff elaborates on various Jewish sects, including the revolutionary figure of Jesus and he details how in the eighteenth century the rapidly expanding Freemasonry movement played crucial roles in the conflagrations known as the American and French revolutions.

Later, Jeff tackles how this agenda of the top tier elites of the Freemasons are being implemented and how it has affected Western Civilization, as well as the development of the United States from its beginning. We discuss the goals of Freemasonry and whether or not Trump’s presidential campaign is part of that agenda.

Title: Johnny Monoxide - The Red Pill Process
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZCh_HlR37Qs
Description: Johnny Monoxide is an electrician from Northern California by way of the East Coast who is also the Fashy, Funny, and Goyish host of a comedy podcast for The Right Stuff, called The Current Year Tonight.

Johnny joins us for a chat about waking up to the anti-White agenda, discovering the Alt-Right scene, and current trends in the movement. We begin with a look back onto Johnny’s winding road through the conspiracy theory world anarchism, libertarianism, anti-authoritarianism, and actually participating in Black Lives Matter protests. He talks about his east coast Italian upbringing and early exposure to the JQ, along with Red Ice’s influence on his red-pilling process and realization that he’d been duped on many levels and poisoned by self-loathing lefty political correctness. We look at the cultural revolution that is swiftly taking hold within the millennial generation as humor and trolling are embraced to cut through the absurdness of the SJW craze. Johnny illustrates the incoherence of the average “normie” regarding the sheer depth of the psychological programming being utilized by the controlled media, and the acuteness of the brainwashing to the beauties of diversity that has most well-meaning folks blindly cheering for their own destruction. Then, we make some predictions about the West’s progressive death march and how we can use comedy to expose Whites to the muck of multiculturalism and inspire embracing a righteous sense of identity.

In the member segment, Johnny recounts a recent excursion to a republican state convention in Burlingame, CA, where he encountered hundreds of Trump protesters and experienced the brunt of the rabid racism festering within the Mexican La Raza movement. Jonny gives some examples of what it’s like seeing a decent CA neighborhood desecrated by Obama’s pet HUD housing initiative, and we mull over the mayhem that has ensued as American monuments and living history are given the racist stamp of obliteration. We consider how altruistic Whites have been guilted into advocating for and engineering their own destruction through tainted history lessons and crooked broadcasting from the teLIEvision. Furthermore, we discuss how an infection of flat-out communistic ideology has managed to hide out in the West since WWII, and we consider the beautiful guilt removing antidote that exists in waking up to this fallacious chapter of history. At the end, we poke some fun at the Jew-installed, “dangerous faggot” commentator, Milo Yiannopoulos, and his ridiculous attempts at infiltrating the Alt-Right scene, and Johnny talks more about The Current Year Tonight and his direction for turning the manipulated media on its silly head through comedy.

Title: Jared Taylor - The Rise of European Advocacy & Trump
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=SkvSyG6w-Ps
Description: Jared Taylor is an American journalist, editor of the webzine American Renaissance and president of New Century Foundation organization, both dedicated to the study of immigration and race relations. Mr. Taylor is the author of several books and scholarly papers, including Paved with Good Intentions and White Identity: Racial Consciousness for the 21st Century. 

A filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members.
http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/extra/program.php?id=1109 

Jared begins by talking about his recent debate at Kentucky State University with political science professor Dr. Wilfred Reilly, where the great advantage of racial diversity in America was disputed. Jared touches on the media flurry he’s enjoyed as Trump bashers attempt to pin the presidential hopeful to a ‘hate monger,’ and we look at the mainstream silence that characteristically surrounds any reporting on the extent of interracial crime. We weigh up the monumental opportunity for highlighting this hypocrisy that the now delayed trial of Dylann Roof offers if he’s allowed to take the stand and present an explanation for his motives. Then, Jared details the upcoming American Renaissance Conference slated for May 20-22 at Montgomery Bell State Park in Burns, Tennessee. He gives the history of the event that has seen over two decades of significant growth, and talks about the lineup, which includes presentations from Peter Brimelow, Fernando Cortéz, Filip Dewinter, James Edwards, Ruuben Kaalep, RamZPaul, Dan Roodt, Anke Van dermeersch, Sam Dickson, and a special video premier from Uncuck the Right. Hour one concludes with an assessment of Trump’s unapologetic ‘America first’ stance and his savvy appeal to nationalism. 

In our member segment, we dig deeper into Trump’s pioneering efforts to address shoddy US borders and the perils of illegal immigration. Jared speaks to the direct expression of national racial chauvinism being displayed by Mexican protesters at Trump rallies, and we look at the shattered financial state and festering cultural warzone coloring America’s southern territories. We consider why Trump has led the pack amongst the most culturally diverse states, and what Sanders’ flawed rhetoric on the beauties of socialism has to say about the naivety of the liberal mindset. Taylor emphasizes the Scandinavian model’s main ingredient of ethnic homogeneity and how the strategy will never work for America as long as the war mongering administration continues to deliver democracy in the form of bombs to the Middle East. We also touch on Hillary Clinton’s role in the utterly deplorable US foreign policy moves that have ripped apart Syria and resulted in the refugee explosion. Then, Jared summarizes some of the main points that are addressed in the 3rd edition of The Color of Crime, which breaks down the seldom reported Hispanic/Black/White/Asian statistical comparisons of the nature of crime in the US. We end on the concept of White privilege and the idea of race as a social construct.

Title: Don Fotheringham - The President Makers: How Billionaires Control US and Foreign Policy
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=E4BXpByNxbg
Description: Don Fotheringham is a WWII Marine Corp Veteran who fought in the Pacific following Pearl Harbor and was awarded the Bronze Star for heroic action at Iwo Jima. After discovering that the policy makers leading America’s war effort had concealed their internationalist aims from the public, he embarked on a lifelong study of America’s foundations and the forces seeking to subvert them. Fotheringham is the author of The President Makers: How Billionaires Control US and Foreign Policy and he lectures widely for Freedom First Society and serves on its Board of Directors.

In this discussion, Don details his discoveries of the deceitful agenda being played out by the elite members of the Council on Foreign Relations and their ultimate goal of overthrowing the national sovereignty of the USA. He asserts that the scheme began to take shape over 125 years ago, when the nation’s most prominent industrialists – John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, and Andrew Carnegie – took possession of the major newspapers and began cultivating a public attitude receptive to globalism and socialism. Don highlights how Carnegie managed to cheat the free enterprise system to build up his steel empire in the railroad business, how Rockefeller swindled his way to the top of the oil industry to become America’s first billionaire, and how Morgan amassed tremendous wealth by manipulating stock markets and financing governments. We learn how the three richest men in the world converged and took a page out of the Rothschild playbook of buying off war mongering politicians and getting governments in debt. Don explains how the Federal Reserve came to fruition in 1917 after Morgan’s newspapers hyped up the phony Bank Panic of 1907. Then, how the Bolshevik Revolution was financed by Morgan and Rockefeller under the direction of President Wilson is illuminated.

In the members’ hour, we focus on the largescale media takeover, prompted by the negative press Rockefeller and crew was receiving for shady swindling, which placed these tycoons in a powerful position to radically control America’s narrative and flow of information. Don delineates how this grip has burgeoned into the six mega-conglomerates – Disney, TimeWarner, CBS, General Electric, Viacom and News, Inc. We look at the tremendous leverage these ties represent and how today’s media titans, including Rupert Murdoch, Sumner Redstone and Brian Roberts, are in collusion with CFR plans for world domination. A bit of a debate ensues as we discuss the special interests groups in cahoots at the helm of this control, and we come up with some differing opinions about the impact that AIPAC has on US involvement in the perpetual state of Middle East war. We also touch on the creation and funding of ISIS and how Israel and the CFR play into the nefarious conspiracy. Later, we look at the tremendous war Trump has been fighting with the media and how disingenuous reporting is effectively exposing the establishment’s dirty tricks. Don rounds off the conversation with insights on dismantling the current corrupt government and he explains how Freedom First Society is working to restore the USA’s basic constitutional principles.

Title: Colin McKay - Occult Banking: Semitic Origins of Double-Entry Bookkeeping & Money Creation - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=KjcyeS3ISOw
Description: Colin McKay is an Australian born entrepreneur living in New South Wales. From 2010-2014 he blogged on finance, economics, and Australian politics and in 2010 he served as board member and bookkeeper for the Center for Economic Stability. In 2011 he presented his own concept for Deror, an alternate currency ecosystem where "everyone is their own central banker.” McKay blogs at Psalmistice.com and is presently writing a book tracing the foundations of double-entry accounting to ancient Semitic cults. 

Colin is with us to provide a detailed overview of his essay “The Money Shot: Even Banking Is All About Sex,” which presents the history and mechanisms of el modo vinegia (“the Venetian method”) of double-entry bookkeeping. He explains how this Hermetic-Kabbalist system for calculating debts that was formalized during the early Renaissance period has been used for deliberately concealing the immoral practice of usury in the banking system. Colin describes how the ancient Semitic worship of the androgynous goddess Inanna-Ishtar and the principle of the unity of opposites (male/female, order/disorder, creation/destruction), used in combination with trickery in the form of deceitful words, is the fundamental underlying concept of creating “money” out of nothing. He illustrates how this “magick” is represented by the Hermetic-Kabbalist alchemical symbol of the hexagram (Seal of Solomon) and breaks down the two-sided, sexual nature of the process at the heart of usury. Then, we discuss Professor Richard Werner’s investigations of the central banking system in Japan and his legal perspective of credit. Colin also talks about the practice of money lending within the Catholic church and the 14th century transformation of modern banking that occurred when the church adopted the Venetian method. 

In the members’ segment, Colin addresses the importance of understanding the mechanisms of the central banking system and the creation of credit by private banks. He explains how the predatory banking system’s core fraud revolves around the changing of labels that lead borrowers to mistake substance for form. Then, Colin introduces his alternate currency, Deror, an honor based system that can be understood by looking at ancient Cuneiform record keeping, which used a bartering system of IOUs overseen by central authorities such as temple priests. He lays out how the algorithm works on the concept of a triangular balance sheet, with credits on one side, debts on another, and an honor rating at the top, and he gives examples of the exchange as a social interaction based on trust. Colin says the idea behind this system is that everyone is able to be a “money god” with infinite potential to create money. Later, we look at the idea that Bitcoin shares similar problems with conventional money in that its worth is based in a value that can be increased through saving rather than spending. At the end, Colin illuminates the occult concept of expanding or lengthening balance sheets as a metaphor for the power of lenders over those they manipulate.

Title: P??erg, Robin Palmblad & Emil Hagberg - The Nordic Resistance Movement - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Clebyx78I94
Description: Pär Öberg is Chief of the Parliamentary branch of the Nordic Resistance Movement and is a city council member in Ludvika, a small town in Dalarna, Sweden. He is also the spokesman of the organization in Swedish media and one of three permanent hosts of Radio Nordfront. Robin Palmblad was born Malmö, Sweden and has been politically active for 16 years, first as a nationalist and later as a national socialist. He is the founder of Radio Nordfront, a podcast broadcasted by the Swedish branch of the Nordic Resistance Movement. Emil Hagberg has been a national activist in Sweden for over 15 years. Formerly “Nästeschef” (Nest Chief) for Stockholm, he is a member of the Nordic Resistance Council, which includes Resistance Movements in Norway, Denmark and Finland. 

Pär, Robin and Emil are with us to discuss their involvement in the Nordic Resistance Movement and the paths that led each of them to embrace National Socialist ideology. Robin summarizes the 9 points of the NRM’s goals and visions, which focus on stopping mass immigration, reconquering power from the global Zionist elite and creating a self-sufficient Nordic state with strong involvement and influence of the people, a citizen-owned mass media, and a modern society living in harmony with the natural order. We consider the demonized version of national socialism that has been propagandized by Hollywood, and the influence that the social policies from the 3rd Reich had on Swede’s glory days prior to WWII. We look at how the economic system of Germany in the 1930s and 40s was free from the Rothschild banking system, and why this independence posed a major threat to the Zionist agenda. Emil illustrates the destructive nature of the privatized, super-capitalist state system of Sweden that is usurping tax revenues to fund the country’s cultural annihilation through mass immigration programs. We learn how asylum centers and homes are financed through classified contracts with Zionist lenders and forcibly established by the Swedish migration agency. We also discuss the problem of Islam in Sweden and the Zionist infiltration of the Sweden Democrats. 

In the members’ half, we get into the static and consistent attacks that the NRM has received from the liberal-controlled Swedish media, and the guys give a clear picture of the absurd hate speech laws that are used to make political prisoners out of activists endorsing national socialism. We discuss the freemasonic flavor of the courts, the Wallenberg banking family, and the incestuous relationships within the political establishment and the media. Then, we weigh up the many ways multiculturalism is eroding the most vulnerable populations of Sweden, along with the special allowances provided to immigrants and the evil entrepreneurs who profit from their infestation. The fellows talk about the strategies of NRM and what they are doing to awaken, organize and mobilize the citizens of Sweden to counter this grim situation. They give examples of how the treasonous government relentlessly acts against the will of the people and seeks to prevent any kind of organized opposition, and we look hopefully to the many strong indications that the ordinary majority is beginning to recognize its true enemies. Pär emphasizes the value of building a solid organizational structure with members who can maintain positions within the existing political system and law enforcement. Our conversation ends on best strategies for the pro-White movement and establishing a doctrine that promises a victorious future for Swedes.

Title: Blonde in the Belly of the Beast - Feminist Mania & Libtard Youth - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-04-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MSL1d6D5L9I
Description: Blonde in the Belly of the Beast is an anti-feminist, anti-cultural Marxism, pro-free speech, anti-Islam, pro-guns, right-leaning libertarian woman living in the Seattle. 

Blonde in the Belly of the Beast joins us for our first ever video version of Radio 3Fourteen, available only for members. The audio version is available to everyone. We'll discuss the commentaries she has been broadcasting via her YouTube channel. We learn about some of her encounters with the run-of-the-mill liberal population of the Pacific NW, where effeminate men, 3rd wave feminists, and social justice warriors reign and women with conservative values are exceptionally rare. Blonde talks about how she came to realize the flaws of liberalism and feminism, and we try to define what it really means to be a feminist in Western society. We touch on the flimsy argument that gender difference is a social construct by looking at the transgender trend and the disparities seen between mothers with careers and stay-at-home moms. Blonde goes on to explain some of her views on the MGTOW scene and the culture of victimization that has divided the sexes. Then, she describes her firsthand experience of the refugee crisis in Europe and relates how Americans are truly blind to the culturally corrosive poison of Islam. Later, we size up the latest destructive manifestation of feminism, the body-positive movement, along with the ills of sexual liberation and the disturbing implications of abortion on demand. At the end, Blonde reveals some of the prickly topics she plans to tackle in future videos.

Title: Frank Raymond - The Caucasian Mind: Transcending Biological Needs - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=uEP0294BhLI
Description: Frank Raymond was born in the Indian subcontinent and spent his early life in Calcutta, Darjeeling, and Dhaka in Bangladesh. He went to college and university in England, and later returned to Bangladesh, where he spent many years running an industrial business and immersing himself in the mind and culture of the people of India. For the past 20+ years Raymond has resided in Vancouver, BC, and due to witnessing the slow destruction of the once-proud Canada, he was inspired to write his first book, “Sweet Dreams and Terror Cells.” 

Frank returns to Red Ice to expand upon his unique outsider’s insight into the workings of the White mind and culture. He begins with an overview of some distinguishing traits of the Caucasian mind-soul, focusing on the special love for animals that is marked in their desire to protect and preserve nature. Frank goes into the first two of what he considers to be the five main elements of the Caucasian mind, beginning with the ability to transcend beyond immediate biological needs to pay attention to immaterial realities and goals. He gives examples of the “energy conservation constraint,” a subconscious drive that prevents many other cultures from indulging in leisurely activities, exploring, or exertions of intellect that would deter from addressing the more practical demands of life. We discuss the theme of the underdog rising to the top that is commonly depicted in Bollywood movies, along with the Hollywood formula of celebrating mediocrity, and how these ideals reflect a time constraint for creativity. Frank makes several points about the tinkering/inventing-type hobbies that are popular amongst White folk as being indicators of another one of the main Caucasian mind characteristics, which is the ability to transcend beyond the present reality to study or ruminate on the abstract. 

In the members’ segment, Frank continues explaining the five mind elements and illustrates how the study of abstract mathematics such as calculus has distinguished White Europeans as being free from the energy conservation constraint. Then, we discuss the phenomenon of what Frank calls “the forest mind” – an awareness of and connection to nature that gives Caucasians a distinctive concern for and feeling of responsibility to the greater collective of planetary life. Then, we look at the exceptional knack for open displays of happiness, the unique biopsychic drive of taking part in joyful activities like singing in a choir or dancing for pleasure, and the transcendent child mind that sets Europeans apart from more serious cultures. Frank goes on to delineate another major difference of the White mind in that there is a unique appetite for exploring the realms of science fiction, time and space travel, and pushing the boundaries of civilization’s advancement. He theorizes that the emergence of differentiated sub-species of humans can perhaps be explained through an other-worldly evolutionary adaptation to life on earth. He notes that the idea of moving through time and parallel dimensions of the universe is a pervasive theme throughout Caucasian mythology. At the end, Frank introduces Shane Douglas, the protagonist of “Sweet Dreams and Terror Cells, who is considered to be a dangerous radical in the eyes of the Mind Masters and Sneak Rulers for seeking to protect and preserve his extraordinary people.

Title: John Morgan - Esotericism on the Right & Plague of Modernity - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PaSoxwL3Mcs
Description: John Morgan was one of the founders and is Editor-in-Chief of Arktos Media, a publisher which has established itself as the leading outlet for the European ‘New Right’ school of thought in English, and has published many other books relevant to the dissident Right and traditionalism more generally. Morgan is also co-editor at the new Right On website. He currently resides in Budapest, Hungary. 

John returns to Red Ice to engage in an assessment of the modern Rightist discourse in Western Europe and the US. He begins with an overview of his intellectual and spiritual journey through esotericism, the occult, existentialism, philosophy, and ancient mythology, which eventually connected him to the conservative revolution of the European Right. We discuss the deeply fractured state of Western civilization that seems to stem from a disjointed awareness of heritage and tradition and lack of spiritual veneration. We consider how this lost kinship has primed the conditions for Islam, whose strength lies in a deeply rooted belief system extending beyond pragmatic politics, to again descend upon the West. John sights this escalating conflict as a deep urge within the human psyche to seek out the authentic and go beyond the prescribed programming of this era of material prosperity and egocentricity. Then, John talks about his first years in business with Integral Tradition Publishing in India, a venture that materialized out of his rejection of modernity with its inherent nihilism and a desire for a broader understanding of the enduring culture and identity of the East. 

In the members’ hour, John shares how he ended up in Hungary with the new incarnation of his publishing company, Arktos Media. We get a glimpse into the uniquely traditional characteristics of Hungarian culture, its resistance to globalization, and the leadership of Victor Orban that has been very outspoken against the current invasion of Europe. John talks about Hungary’s 2014 election, which resulted in 45% of the votes for moderate right party Fidesz ad 25% for the more radical right party Jobbik. He touches on the basic rejection of liberalism and interest in traditionalism that both parties represent, and addresses accusations that Jobbik harbors “anti-Semitic” sentiments. Further, John makes some comparisons between Jobbik’s strongly socialist, anti-capitalistic stance and the greatly conflicting picture of socialism in America. We look at the significance of spirituality in serious traditionalist subcultures like Fidesz and Jobbik and how this differs greatly in the ideological focus of Western Europe’s mainstream Right. Then, we analyze the extreme emphasis that has been placed on IQ scores and genetics by White Nationalists of the American Alt-Right, and we explore how Europeans across the board can embrace a sense of cultural identity and pride without getting hung up solely on race. At the end, we address how to engage in the metapolitical battle to redefine and restore Western culture.

Title: Mike King - The British Mad Dog: Debunking the Myth of Winston Churchill - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2d2a0QrfgEk
Description: Mike King is a private investigative journalist and researcher based in the New York City area. A 1987 graduate of Rutgers University, King's subsequent 27-year career in Marketing & Advertising has equipped him with a unique perspective when it comes to understanding how "public opinion" is scientifically manufactured. Mike is the author of over a dozen books, including “Planet Rothschild,” “Mein Side of the Story” and “The Bad War” and he is the editor of TomatoBubble.com. 

Mike joins us for another revealing episode of unraveling the lies, omitted truths, propaganda and brainwashing that have shaped the hearts and minds of Western civilization. Our discussion focuses on the subject of King’s latest book, “The British Mad Dog: Debunking the Myth of Winston Churchill.” We begin with a look into the English blueblood family that was prominent in high society and politics for 250 years before the man championed as “The British Bulldog” was produced. Mike touches on Churchill’s early upbringing in military boarding schools as the son of an abusive, distant father and NYC socialite mother, and grandson of the “King of Wall Street.” We learn about his years as a highly paid English war correspondent, entry into British parliament, and his swift appointment on the eve of the great war as the First Lord of the British Admiralty. Then, Mike explains Churchill’s role in the German hunger blockade of WWI, a key point when it became clear he was playing in the globalist Zionist game. He characterizes the reckless and psychopathic behavior that Churchill became known for, most notably his perpetual drunkenness and indebtedness, poor political strategies, his part in the catastrophic 1926 crash of the British economy, and a callous disregard for human life. Mike also covers the “Wilderness Years,” when Churchill was banished from politics, and his return to power that was financed by the same Jewish billionaires who were angling for a war with Germany. 

In the members’ segment, Mike talks about Churchill’s tarnished reputation with the British public and how he managed to rise once again despite being booted from his position as Prime Minister. We look at the outset of WWII when bloodthirsty Churchill was at the forefront of engineering and deliberately provoking the bombing of his own country by the Germans. Further, Mike discusses Hitler’s appeals to Britain and attempts for peace agreements to stop the ensuing war, and his response to the indiscriminate carpet bombings of German civilians that were propagandized to the hilt, solidifying the demonization of National Socialist Germany. Later, we get into the vindictive orchestration of the 1943 Bengal famine that coincided with India’s fight for independence, of which Churchill was fiercely against. Then, we look at one of the most enduring myths of WWII – the purported looting of fine art across Germany and Europe by the Nazis. Mike illustrates Hitler’s veneration for art, architecture and heritage and his foresight to save the cultural treasures that would have been destroyed by the Allied Forces in their barbaric bombing crusades, which targeted neutral, friendly and even allied countries. At the end, we consider the psychological warfare that continues whipping Germany into submission in the latest chapter of demoralization known as the Kalergi Plan.

Title: Oscar Turner - OmniPhi: Visual Aesthetics in Media Production
Date: 2016-04-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=66Hm14Mbfm0
Description: Oscar Turner is the creator of Omniphi Media and for the past couple years has been producing, editing and narrating videos that challenge the corrupt mainstream media coalition who seek the genetic and cultural annihilation of the European people. Oscar’s work is dense with rich graphics and animations, with notable productions such as “The European Giant,” “Voice of Europe,” and “Dr. William L. Pierce – Conditioning for Death.” 

In this discussion, Oscar describes how he became interested in the backstories of history and countering the deliberately destructive role of the mass media in American society. We learn how an 8th grade reading assignment on the holocaust prompted Oscar to question the accepted narrative of the history books and led him to the discovery of inspirational men like William Pierce, David Duke and Kai Murros. We talk about the dominating forces in Hollywood responsible for promoting a lefty ‘counter culture’ fueled by degeneracy and a hatred for America’s European ancestry since the 60s, and we look at ways to build the rising right momentum that is directed towards reinvigorating a more traditional, nationalistic narrative. Oscar delves into his creative process of video making and his goals for reaching a wider audience through addressing issues that inform on both politics and White identity. We consider the types of internet personalities who are able to appeal to the hyperactive pace of the millennials, and we weigh up some of the characters who have tried to infiltrate and tarnish the true positioning of the alternative right. Then, Oscar touches on some of his experiences with the transhumanism movement and he points out how these forward thinking visionaries may be a godsend if the west is fully seized by a hostile, non-white majority. In closing, Oscar gives some tips for getting into video production and how we can gear our energy towards a new renaissance of culture creation.

Title: Tough Love, Mammon, Aussie Tory & Gustav - The Plight and Fight in Australia & New Zealand - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Uqs4M2D91_c
Description: Tough Love is a New Zealander of European descent who writes a blog of original articles and creative writings that focus on White identity and the bi-cultural experience. Aussie Tory is an aspiring academic in his mid-twenties who has been involved in Nationalist, New Right and traditionalist circles for close to a decade. He currently writes at thedingoes.xyz and is a regular on "The Convict Report" podcast. Mammon is a young lad from Australia, co-host of the Convict Report and co-editor of The Dingoes. During his time at university he became disillusioned by the hostile, anti-Western rhetoric and chose to get involved in securing the interest of our people and the preservation of the Australian Nation. Gustav is an Australian man in his late 20's who has had an active interest in political philosophy and economics from a young age. He was 'red-pilled' by the New Right in late 2013 and has been increasingly involved in the scene since last year through blogging and networking. 

In this program, we take a look at the general state of Australia and New Zealand in relation to multiculturalism, immigration, and the similar displacement that is happening in Europe and North America. We discuss the rise of Islam in Australia, peppered with a series of attacks on Whites, and the response by MSM and government that painted the native population as racist for showing resistance to the boorish behavior. We look at how the installation of the AU Fabian Society in the late 1940s and the change of immigration policies in the 70s ushered in an era of multicultural growth pronounced by a heavy advancement of Asians. Gustav explains the new vision of AU history that took shape during the 60s, which labeled the country’s founding by the British monarchy as a great injustice and theft of land and solidified the grand narrative of evil white oppressors. Tough Love talks about New Zealand’s Maori population and its skewed aboriginal history that claims large swaths of land and immaterial rights as belonging to the tribe, and he illustrates how the excuse of systemic racism has been used to congeal a robust reparations industry for the deteriorating population. We also consider the new colonization that is taking place Down Under, where the world’s highest immigration rates are quickly transforming demographics, driving up real estate rates, bottlenecking the job market, and brandishing increased crime and violence. 

In the members’ half, we analyze the circumstances that have led to the anti-white agenda and decline in nationalist pride in AU and NZ. The Dingoes talk about the greater Asianization of the sister countries, designed to secure inclusion in the globalist economy, and fueling a renewed national impetus due to the stagnation of wages and a shift away from traditional society. We learn about the government’s Treaty Tribunal and its many versions of tribal laws that have allowed for fuzzy interpretations and an expanding resource ownership management scheme that resembles an apartheid takeover. Then, we get into the recent move to modify the AU national flag, mulling over the hostility towards European heritage and potential destruction of patriotic values that the failed initiative represented. Aussie Tory helps us distinguish what a true Australia really looks like, and why hostile invaders pose an awful threat to a pure reflection of the European diaspora’s spirit that built up the country. At the end, Mammon addresses the sad disdain Europeans have toward their place in society as the thrust for multicultural inclusion continues, and we reflect on Mother Europa’s looming disintegration and her vulnerable areas of the world that may not have a future without the solidarity of all of Western civilization’s branches.

Title: David Whitehead - Embracing The Warrior in a Culture of Victimhood - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-04-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=iiugCH91wnQ
Description: David Whitehead is a full time Martial Arts instructor and entrepreneur, a coach in the holistic health and wellness field, and conducts professional seminars and workshops in Canada and around the world. He gives in-depth presentations on his unique perspective on the warrior archetype, and shares his ideas on the many modern day applications of this ancient warrior philosophy for individual and societal empowerment. David is an avid adventurer and independent researcher, and runs his own podcast show called ‘Truth Warrior.’ 

David joins us for a discussion about the way of the warrior who incorporates the pursuit of truth while staying open to new information and mastering the art of personal refinement. He points to control of overall physical, spiritual and emotional wellbeing as key to becoming a fully realized being in this often malevolent world, and this requiring serious discipline, flexibility and adaptability to perform at an optimal level. David talks about the importance of balanced exploration into the physical and spiritual dimensions of life, and he explains how martial arts is a practical, hands-on way to realize this equilibrium. We delve into victimhood and avoiding responsibility as means to give away personal power, and David illustrates the ways honing a warrior philosophy can help boost confidence and aid in personal growth. We also touch on the idea that being connected to one’s ancestors and roots and having a healthy understanding of the uniquely different cultures that comprise the human family is paramount in any fully functioning society. Further, we get into the disappearance of the hero archetype and the replacement of the ubermensch with the underdog as key indicators of a cultural decay. Also discussed is the proper use of violence, conveying a stature of confidence as a means of self-defense, and the importance of children being allowed to experience struggle in self-realization. We round things off by looking at the function of moral codes and living a disciplined life, and David gives some solid advice for taking up the study of martial arts.

Title: Frank Jorge - Obama's Symbolic Visit to Cuba - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=x_3N1i1pD1k
Description: Frank Jorge is an American who was born in Guantanamo, Cuba in 1950. He immigrated to the USA in 1957 under a normal, non-refugee Visa process with his parents and sister and was raised in California where he became active as a Minuteman against illegal immigration. Jorge is a retired electronic technician and host of Frank and Friends Internet Radio Show. 

In this program we get Frank’s take on President Obama’s recent historical trip to Cuba and his symbolic, propaganda-filled speech that illuminated yet another merge towards the globalist agenda. Frank talks about the conditions in Cuba that prompted his parents to flee the country in its last couple of years under the dictatorial rule of Batista. We trace over the rebel uprising and Cuban revolution that propelled Fidel Castro to power, launching an era of communist command, miserable poverty, and civil unrest that extends to this day. Frank gives an assessment of the communist origins of Obama’s political career, his relationship to the Islamic State, and his ties to special interest radicals like the Black Panthers. We touch on the anti-White lamenting that saturated Obama’s Cuban address and played perfectly in to the war on Europeans that has been building steam since the Civil Rights movement. Further, we consider the correlation between black emancipation and social unrest in the US, looking at the brainwashing propaganda that has been programming citizens to abandon natural impulses to self-segregate. We also put focus on the disingenuous narrative of racial discrimination that points the finger at whitey for the failure of blacks to integrate within a European governance system. Then, we look at how Obama’s lifting of the trade embargo on Cuba essentially brings the US one step closer to fully embracing its communist underpinnings that have been thinly disguised as democracy. 

In the members’ half, Frank makes some predictions for Cuba’s future in the global market and how the cash-strapped country will adapt after decades of pinched freedoms. We take stock of how the transnational mechanism manages to herd 3rd world populations into the West while gobbling up the middle class and stimulating profits for the world elite. Frank talks about the detrimental effects of multiculturalism on countries like Brazil, and we look at how the faulty premises of equality go against the grain of ethnically homogenous societies. We tie this in to the US’s increasing problems with violence and crime amongst minority groups, along with the effects that drastically changing demographics have had on the morale of disenfranchised Europeans. Then, we get into the forthcoming US presidential election and Trump’s symbolism as the country’s last-ditch effort to salvage the dream of its European forefathers. We discuss the conditions that have resulted in America’s dwindling sense of nationalism, including the establishment’s ceaseless warmongering and meddling in the Middle East, its failure to protect cultural cohesion and borders, and now the threat of dirty bombs being imported by Muslim extremists. Moreover, we try to pin down the fundamental rationale for the US’s undying pledge of allegiance to Israel, and we close with thoughts on the synchronicity of events in the West that point to a plot of White genocide.

Title: Rob Kievsky - Mastering High-Investment Parenting & Building a Merchant Guild - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=CGQunpu0Lww
Description: Rob Kievsky is an intellectual specializing in the theory and practice of finding, describing, and correcting the deficits or the major problems of our modern lives. He is a business owner and family man who identifies as a White Nationalist and he seeks to positively influence others who share his path. 

Rob joins us for a discussion about two matters he deems to be crucial for a successful White Nationalist movement: mastering high-investment child rearing and building a merchant guild. We first look into the forms of warfare we are faced with in this current era, which are designed to arrest the finances, minds and culture of working-class America while lining the pockets of globalist elites. Rob talks about the need for Americans to adopt a merchant mentality by investing in small businesses and creating cohesive networks of commerce operated by and benefiting likeminded folk and families. He emphasizes the importance of investigating ventures and proper business building, along with minimizing mistakes by learning “trade secrets and cheat codes” from industry insiders. We also look at the value of owning a family-run business that allows for high investment parenting, and raising kids with minimal TV exposure. 

In the members’ segment, we address how to bring up children who are capable of resisting influences from our incompetent, degenerate enemies, and Rob describes some of his parenting strategies. Then, Rob illustrates the inspiration and insight he has gained from reading spy memoirs, speaking to the importance of shifting one’s mentality in order to gather useful tactics from adversaries. He gives examples of using this approach in the business world. Later, we get into the effect that Trump is having on the shifting Overton window and America’s crumbling politically correct mold. We also discuss the left’s utter lunacy and its swift descent into self-destruct mode, and we look at ways to take advantage of civilization’s unhinged state. At the end, we take stock of how we can step up to the plate and make good use of the massive cultural awakening being stirred by the overplayed liberal hand.

Title: Greg Johnson - Straight But Not Narrow Nationalism: Gays, Women & The Manosphere
Date: 2016-03-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NWt5Cz6ngLI
Description: Greg Johnson is Editor-in-Chief of Counter Currents. He is the author of "Confessions of a Reluctant Hater," "New Right vs. Old Right," and the newly published “Truth, Justice, & a Nice White Country.” 

Greg is with us to address the wave of “gay panic” that has recently swept through the Alt Right scene, along with the static surrounding the role of women and the legitimacy of the manosphere within the Nationalist movement. We discuss accusations that men are overrepresented in the Alt Right and implications that the involvement of more women is needed to dispel the gay rumor. Then, we look at the manosphere-type jerks that fuel the irrelevancy of this feminist blame game by denigrating the women who are actually adding value to the cause with solid contributions. Greg expands upon his stance that White Nationalism should be “straight, but not narrow,” pointing out that upholding the biological norms of sexual differentiation and the heterosexual family includes respecting people who may deviate from the standards, yet stand true to the policies of racial integrity. We also get into the transgender phenomenon, homophobia, the Christian notion of original sin, marriage ethics, declining White birth rates, and the feminization of heterosexual men. Greg speaks to the morally corrupt credos of the manosphere, and why women are attracted to the “dark triad traits” of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and sociopathy. Further, we consider how actualizing the capacity for excellence within society involves being realistic about shameful behavior and nihilistic traits that undermine healthy norms. Our conversation rounds off with a look at the main political absolutes of White advocacy and what it means to be an authentic vanguardist.

Title: Jan Ott - Oera Linda Book: An Ancient Frisian Manuscript - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kflHJpB9f1s
Description: Jan Ott was born and raised in rural Westfriesland in North-Holland, and later settled in Germany. In 2009 he began studying the Oera Linda Book (OLB), a controversial Frisian manuscript that became well known in the 1870s and had a revival in the 1930s. He has been blogging about the OLB since 2011 and made a one-hour video in English, German, Dutch, Norse and Frisian, debunking the main claims of the hoax-theory. Ott is working on a new English translation, which will be published together with a new transliteration and scans of all 190 pages. 

Jan joins us to discuss his extensive research into the fascinating language and content of the Oera Linda Book, a story that begins in the 6th century BC and contains information predating 1500 BC. The manuscript first surfaced in 1867, when third-generation shipbuilder Cornelis Over de Linden enlisted a Frisian history and language research society to assist in deciphering and translating the ancient text. Jan explains the heated controversy that surrounded the 1872 publication of the translation, which came at an unstable period in European history and greatly upset the centuries-old established belief system. We learn about the structure of the Old Frisian alphabet, said to have been created by the mythological folk mother, Frya and based on the six-spoke wheel, the JOL or yule, a sacred symbol representing time, eternity and perfection, as well as the origin of everything. Jan talks about the main components of the book, including two letters of warning addressed to descendants of the book’s creators, corresponding names from ancient Nordic, Germanic and Greek mythology, mention of a Golden Age devastated by a cataclysmic geological shift and a great flood, and movements of Caucasians throughout the northern hemisphere. 

In the members’ segment, we discuss the time frame during the 1930s political uprising of National Socialism when the OLB resurfaced with renewed interest and more rejection by official scientists. Jan explains SS leader Heinrich Himmler’s interest in the book, its connection to Indo-Aryan/European culture, and the creation myth that describes how the three main races (white, yellow and black) would have descended from three primal mothers. We consider the various sets of laws contained within the book that are typically frowned upon today by Whites who are instilled with a sense of self-hatred and lost identity. Then, Jan gets into the long history of connections and splits between Germanic and northwest Indian tribes, and we look at the role migration has played in shifting around various cultural and linguistic elements within northern Europe. We end by weighing up the current Western political power structure that actively dismisses, demonizes and destroys anything that may strengthen a sense of belongingness, identity and veneration for the amazing ancient European world and its ancestors.

Title: Nick Griffin & Jack Sen - The Battle for the Future of Europe - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=djdGnPLXZkU
Description: Nick Griffin, described at various times as "the most dangerous man in British politics" and "the most successful far-right leader in British history," has been active in radical nationalist politics since he joined the National Front in 1974 at the age of 15. In 2009 he was elected as a member of the European Parliament while leader of the British National Party. Mr. Griffin is now Vice-President of the pan-European Alliance for Peace and Freedom and Political Adviser to the British Unity Party. 

Jack Sen was the United Kingdom Independence Party's (UKIP) prospective Member of Parliament for West Lancashire before being unceremoniously, and quite publicly, suspended. Jack then served the British National Party as its North West spokesman in 2015, but stepped down to concentrate on his British Renaissance Policy Institute and finish his book, “How to Get Suspended from UKIP and the BNP in 10 Articles and 2 Tweets.” 

Nick and Jack discuss their current political engagement and the series of films that BRPI is producing to document the work of British and American Nationalists and create a permanent public record unsullied by the warped and inaccurate accounts of the anti-European establishment and its controlled media. We sum up the main concerns being addressed by genuine Nationalists, including the Islamification of Western Europe and the overarching state of dispossession the indigenous population is experiencing. Jack and Nick explain how the White birth rate decline transpired at the same time as 2nd wave feminism, and we look deeper into the deliberately provoked, divisional force of this anti-male hysteria. We also talk about the Zionist thrust to create a multicultural mishmash out of the West, and the issue of popular alt-news outlets glossing over the relationship between immigration and the rise of terrorism and everyday violence. We touch on the turf wars going on inside the Muslim faction within Europe, and how attacks by radical terrorism networks are fueling more cause for the federalization of the European police force. Then, Nick and Jack outline the APF’s objectives and its metapolitical mission to shift the Overton window to the right. 

For the members’ segment, we focus on the steps that must be taken to turn around the ailing state of England and Europe at large, which involves a bit of a debate over the viability of the current political system. Nick illustrates the sheer corruption and manipulation that surrounds the election process, and he describes his infamous Question Time lynching on the BBC that surprisingly resulted in a quadrupling of the BNP’s poll ratings. Then, we look to the possibility of a European civil war erupting and the feasibility of an armed resistance by average citizens with an aversion to firearms and, conversely, the muslim population that is infatuated by and fully loaded with advanced weaponry. Later, we discuss how Europe can rid itself of the liberal, cultural Marxist, SJW infection that has stolen the pride and identity of its people, and we consider how renewed ethnic cohesion can reinvigorate a desire for young people to have children and stand by traditional family values.

Title: James Edwards - Racism Schmacism: Trump & "White Supremacy" - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-03-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Eosxodif_iI
Description: ames Edwards is the founding host of The Political Cesspool, an award-winning talk show broadcast on AM radio in the US. Mr. Edwards has appeared as a commentator numerous times on television and his work on the radio has been the subject of articles in over 250 of the most prominent newspaper and magazine publications around the world. James has been named an “Honorary City Councilman” in Memphis, Tennessee, where his show has received a certificate of recognition for outstanding contribution to the community. His first book, “Racism, Schmacism” was released in 2010. 

James joins us for a look into some trending topics concerning race, politics and hypocrisy in America, of which he has been covering “the other side” of for eleven years at TPC. We begin with James detailing the circumstances of his recent Tennessee Trump rally coverage - an event that grabbed him national MSM attention and characterized his particular flavor of pro-White as “White supremacist.” We discuss the passionate climate that surrounds any gathering of Trump supporters, drawn chiefly by the issues of illegal immigration, the new Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, and giving the flip to political correctness. We also consider the magical spell of the word “racist” that has kept most conservative Americans silent about the 3rd world transformation of their once unified nation. We also get into Trump’s stance on Israel and his place on the warmonger scale, and we consider the politics that have infected all facets of the American establishment since the 50s. At the end, James illustrates the hypocrisy of the Confederate flag fiasco and the billionaire-funded #blacklivesmatter campaign, along with the epicness of American patriots that have united throughout history to preserve European culture and values.

Title: Matthew Bracken - Brussels Attacks Islams European Offensive is Only Beginning - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=fZ4Pydl2c6s
Description: Matt Bracken was born in 1957 in Baltimore, Maryland, and graduated from the University of Virginia in 1979 with a degree in Russian Studies. He was commissioned as a Naval officer and served on east coast SEAL teams during the 1980s as a Special Warfare officer, including leading a SEAL detachment to Beruit, Lebanon in 1983. He has worked as a boat builder, welder, and charter boat skipper, and holds a Coast Guard captain's license. Bracken is the author of several books, including “Enemies Foreign and Domestic,” which is also the name of his website that features a collection of essays, social commentary and short fiction. 

Matt joins us on the heels of the Brussels terror attack to help put in perspective the complexity and seriousness of the problems we face with the Islamic invasion of Europe. Matt has written an important essay, “Tet, Take Two: Islam’s 2016 European Offensive,” which details how three great social forces – Islam, international socialism, and nationalism – have been set in motion to collide in a monumental showdown comparable to WWI and WWII. We discuss how Belgium became the new hotbed for the Muslim Brotherhood, allowing a 1,400-year old Islamic quest for global conquest incubate inside the heart of Europe. We go over some details of the capture of the ringleader of the Nov 2015 Paris attacks, Salah Abdeslam, in Brussels just days before the latest attacks, and we sort out how the traitorous globalist socialist elite are using the Muslim invasion and its ensuing chaos as a weapon against their own European people. 

In the members’ hour, Matt plainly illustrates that there will be no deporting or assimilating of the Muslims already within Europe, and due to the failure of the EU’s Schengen Zone, there will be no stopping the flooding in of millions more “refugees.” He emphasizes how this infiltration will undoubtedly lead to more bombings, more no-go zones, and a major problem for police if our modern technological infrastructure comes under attack. We consider the great brainwashing that has been inflicted upon the altruistic people of the West by the MSM regarding the true demographics of the invasion and the numerous other attacks and aggressions that aren’t being covered, and we talk about Donald Trump’s ability to appeal to Americans by tearing the veil off the root cause of some of the US’s most serious crime issues. Matt also covers what can be expected as we see more refugee centers within Europe become clogged with Muslim men that are hell bent on making Hijrah, or Jihad by migration.

Title: Amelia Raath - Radical AntiWhite Marxism in South Africa - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-03-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PG3fp7AAafQ
Description: Amelia Raath is an Afrikaner of Dutch and German descent, born in South Africa and currently residing in Bloemfontein in the Free State. Amelia obtained a BA degree in Fine Arts at University of the Free State, specializing in Drawing and Painting, and then earned a certificate in Health Coaching from The Institute for Integrative Nutrition. 

Amelia is with us to offer her perspective on the social climate of South Africa and illustrate the conditions that influenced her awakening to the White genocide agenda. We begin with a glimpse into Amelia’s upbringing at an Afrikaner Christian girls’ school and an all-girls university. She talks about her struggles with finding sustainable employment opportunities and how her derailed state of health led her to a major lifestyle change and the pursuit of a career in health coaching. Amelia discusses her “waking up” and the rediscovery of her ancient Germanic and Nordic roots, along with the realization of the deep brainwashing that teaches Afrikaners to hate their own race. We talk about the lies and double standards instilled at liberal universities that endorse ethnic cleansing of Whites and reinforce the distorted push for affirmative action. Amelia details some of the protests and chaos instigated by disgruntled blacks on campuses in South Africa, and she describes how the media continually portrays White supremacy as the culprit for the deficiencies of the African majority. Furthermore, we look at the culture clashing tactics of the Economic Freedom Fighters, along with the racially prejudiced policies of the African National Congress, which together yield an impossible climate for Afrikaners to defend their existence in post-Apartheid South Africa. At the end, Amelia shares some inspiration for Europeans to honor their diverse and remarkable cultures, and she highlights some key ingredients for strong and balanced health.

Title: Sencha MacRae - The Russian Bolshevik Revolution - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-03-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=xaF28yBSCTY
Description: Sencha MacRae is behind UntoldTales.net, a website that is dedicated to turning stories around and revealing the untold history of the European people. 

Sencha joins us to discuss some of the hidden facts and blatant lies she has been working to expose at Untold Tales. She begins by talking about how she got interested in the 1917 Russian Revolution and the stories surrounding the idealized Bolsheviks. We consider how slanted Western journalism have spun glossy tales of the Bolshevik Coup and marginalized the horrific reality of the tens of millions of Ukrainian and Russian peasant farmers genocided by starvation and brutal murder. Sencha touches on the brutal massacre of Russia’s royal Tsar Nicholas and family, ordered by Lenin, that led to WWI and the mass transformation of the state apparatus as the Jewish elite slid into control of the Communist regime and Christians were targeted for elimination. Then, we look at the current American version of communism manifested in the forms of endless media programming, political correctness, cheap consumer goods and junk food. Later, we weigh up how Trump is tapping into the burgeoning frustration and resentment of Americans that are feeling debased by insane foreign policies, a crumbling economy, and an American dream that is becoming a 3rd world nightmare.

Title: Matt Forney - r/K Selection Theory: The Evolutionary Psychology Behind Politics - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=csrrOqPtycU
Description: Matt Forney is an author, journalist and entrepreneur currently based in Chicago. A native of Syracuse, New York, he has lived in Canada as well as the Philippines, and studied English and journalism at SUNY Plattsburgh and the University at Albany. Forney is a columnist for Return of Kings and Right On, and blogs regularly at his website MattForney.com. Additionally, he is the author of the self-help guide “Confessions of an Online Hustler” and several other books. 

Matt returns to Red Ice for a discussion about the subject matter of the book by Anonymous Conservative, “The Evolutionary Psychology Behind Politics.” He explains the concept from evolutionary biology known as the r/K selection theory, and how this relates to the evolution of liberalism (r-strategist) vs. conservatism (K-strategist). By comparing the mating strategies of wolves and rabbits in the wild, we can see how politics is really a conflict between the K-strategist wolves, who are genetically predisposed to high-investment parenting and fierce competition in a world of scarce resources, and the r-strategist rabbits, who are designed to freely and carelessly graze on abundant resources while rapidly multiplying in numbers to exploit such a glut. Matt describes the way civilizations tend to swing back and forth between the two strategies depending on the availability of resources, and he relates how we are currently seeing a major tipping point from r to K selection. We tie this theory in with present day rape statistics, the right to bear arms, martial law, gangs, racial relations, gender roles, politics, and more. We also address narcissism, the dominant personality disorder of our time, and the role this plays in the manipulation of the K-selected by the r-strategists. 

In the members’ segment, we make an assessment of how the r/K selection theory is manifesting in the Trump phenomenon, where we are seeing a major polarization of two opposing American ideologies. We consider how Trump’s open advocating of nationalist policies is reflecting the sentiments of average marginalized citizens who are fed up with the globalist agenda and all the progressive, politically correct bulls#!t. Matt emphasizes how Trump is threatening the entire con of the establishment with his unapologetic grandiloquence and financial independence, and we talk about the incredible level of lies and propaganda that is being resorted to by the disingenuous media in an effort to derail his burgeoning success. Then, Forney gives a recap of the Chicago Trump rally fiasco, and he gives an appraisal of the chances for Clinton, Sanders and Cruz staying in the presidential race. We also discuss how Trump is appealing to minorities despite his bold stance on illegal immigration. At the end, we take a brief call from “Joe,” a young man who attended the Chicago Trump rally. He gives a play by play account of the chaos and disruption by the Marxist “Reds” that shut down the event, and he illustrates how the lefty media spun their web of lies around the psychotic behavior of the protestors.

Title: Curt Doolittle - New Declaration for the New Right - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=c3uL05gYifc
Description: Curt Doolittle is an American entrepreneur and author living in Kiev, Ukraine. He is an independent theorist of political economy in the conservative libertarian tradition, and founder of the Propertarian Institute. 

Curt returns to Red Ice to talk about his new declaration for the direction of the New Right, as the time for a revolution is clearly upon us. We begin by looking at the old right’s failed philosophies of equality and democracy, and the fact that Western success isn’t just a product of good virtue, but rather a result of eliminating parasites for thousands of years. Curt declares that we have reached the limit of tolerance for the comforting lies of the establishment, the pseudo-sciences and enlightenment mythos, and we now have permission to tell the truth, which is based in empirical evidence and biological science. We consider how to market the New Right by providing emotionally appealing solutions for the disenfranchised people of the West. Curt emphasizes the need for a government with a market for commons that cannot be monopolized by the lower class and profited on solely by the aristocracy. Then, we discuss Trump’s viability as the new Caesar who will oust bloodsucking politicians from the current US government, clamp down on unrestricted immigration, dissolve federal power, and reinvigorate the production of commons and the American economy. Curt also addresses the benefits of provoking a civil war to create a fear of loss of the expensive commons already in place, and to raise the cost of the status quo so that creating a revolution in order to reach compromise is vital. 

In the members’ half, we weigh up the importance of making this new declaration for the New Right, attacking and replacing the conservative mainstream dialogue, and providing a concrete, relatable ideology for ordinary people. Curt explains why he views force and violence as necessary components in establishing limits for the system and restoring natural order, and he illustrates how traitors in our own ranks have allowed a rampant concentration of mischief and crime filter into European lands with the Muslim invasion. We discuss what it will take to create a constructive movement, put together leadership, and organize skilled people within locales that will put boots on ground to eradicate hostile trespassers. Curt speaks to the practical proof that violence is incredibly useful for resolving conflict, and that mastery of violence is the first and most important aspect for organizing any revolt. He also describes the crucial steps for a proper dethroning of tyrannical government, and we consider how to fund these opportunities, create local networks for recruitment, and work towards producing results that will salvage Western civilization.

Title: Frank Raymond - An Outsider's Insight into the White Mind & Caucasian Culture - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=y--z7SEtypY
Description: Frank Raymond was born in the Indian subcontinent and spent his early life in Calcutta, Darjeeling, and Dhaka in Bangladesh. He went to college and university in England, and later returned to Bangladesh, where he spent many years running an industrial business and immersing himself in the mind and culture of the people of India. For the past 20+ years Raymond has resided in Vancouver, BC, and due to witnessing the slow destruction of the once-proud Canada, he was inspired to write his first book, “Sweet Dreams and Terror Cells.” 

Frank is with us to provide some interesting and unique outsider’s insight into the workings of the White mind and culture. He stands for the principle that every race is irreplaceable and valuable, and he opposes the Cultural Marxist and ‘liberal’ tenet that the white race alone is non-existent and/or evil, worthless and dispensable. Frank describes his motivation for writing the novel, giving various examples of the ‘unique groove’ of the White mind that he sees is taken for granted and at great danger of being lost as the demographics of European lands are being dramatically reshaped through mass immigration. He defines the enemy within the gates as ‘sneak rulers’ who are engineering, through mind control, the genocide of the White race in order to usher in a globalized, identity-less mongrel race. Frank also details some of the stark cultural contrasts of India and the West, underscoring the fact that the Indian people would never allow one inch of their land to be colonized by alien invaders. We discuss evidence that White people are among the best stewards of the earth, and indications that as their numbers diminish, so too shall the safety and social order of the world. Then, Frank speaks to the sense of romance, mystery, and connection to the unknown that is a distinct part of the European folk spirit, and he tells several stories about his encounters with White people that illustrate a dwindling awareness of mythic imagination and ancestral heritage. 

In the members’ segment, we dig deeper into the destructive force of White genocide and the innumerable exceptional traits that will be lost in the displacement of Western civilization and enforcement of multiculturalism. Frank gives more examples of the distinct behaviors of Caucasians and what makes the White mind different from all others. He talks about the sense of humor and the transcendent child mind, along with little idiosyncratic traits like voice pitch and laughter that have been developed over millennia. We also discuss treasured pastimes that are unique to Europeans, such as classical music, bird watching, dog shows and costume parties. Further, Frank describes Whites’ distinct respect and valuation of children, play and storytelling. We end by considering the vast diversity in physical characteristics that exist amongst the wide array of European tribes.

Title: Dr. David Duke - Trump - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0zm1Jg5X3Sk
Description: Dr. David Duke is a graduate of Louisiana State University with a BA in History. He pursued a PhD in the largest university in Ukraine and in 2005 completed his Doctoral Defense in Kiev. Duke is a former member of the House of Representatives from Louisiana and is the author of the books “Jewish Supremacism,” “My Awakening” and “The Secret Behind Communism.”

Dr. Duke, along with Lana from Radio 3Fourteen, joins us to take stock of the extraordinary presidential campaign of Donald Trump and the unprecedented crusade by the controlled media to destroy his reputation and that of his supporters. David addresses the recent attempts by the mainstream news to stump Trump by inaccurately portraying Duke as an endorser and drudging up his 1970s involvement with the KKK, while at the same time ignoring the fact that Bernie Sanders is an openly Zionist, former Trotskyite communist. We look at the symbol of power that Trump has become for disenfranchised Americans as he changes the discourse with his unabashed criticisms on immigration, trade issues, and preserving European American culture. Dr. Duke details where Trump is alienating prospective supporters with some of his more calloused remarks and personal attacks, while at the same time social media stats prove his popularity is soaring. Then, we put some focus on the latest display of “diversity” at its finest at the Chicago Trump rally debacle, and David draws some lines in the sand showing how this kind of insane hypocrisy is normalized by the real racists that are the Zionist oligarchs of banking, media and politics.

In the members' segment, Lana points to some clear indications revealed by the Trump campaign that Whites are craving nationalism, and David makes some points about what our reaction should be to propel the movement and grow ranks. David says voting for Trump should be a strategic move to further the fight to wake up our people about what is at stake in White countries and exposing the evil cabal running the globalist plan to drive racial Europeans to extinction. We talk about the best strategies for educating people on the identity of the Jewish supremacist tribe at the helm of this ethnic cleansing brigade, taking special consideration for ways to reach dedicated Christians who support Zionist Israel. Then, we size up republican candidate Ted Cruz, who his biggest sponsors are, and where the controlled opposition to Trump is getting its millions from. We also touch on the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the rise of communism in America, and Israel’s destruction of Palestine. Later, we hone in on steps to forming a political revolution and the significance of taking part in what will undoubtedly be the most critical presidential election in history.

Title: Walter T. Richmond - "Refugee Crisis" Propaganda: What You're Not Being Told - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-03-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NJCzyCa8x3U
Description: Col. Walter T. Richmond is the penname of the author of the new book, “Hasta la Vista EUROPE!” A member of a military veteran family, Col. Richmond was born and grew up in the US. After graduating basic and officer training at the top of his class, and serving in a variety of emergency, law enforcement, and disaster response capacities, Richmond was commissioned a colonel in the 1990s. He then left uniformed services and worked in various television, radio, communications, and media-related fields. 

Walter first explains his inspiration for writing the book, which was sparked as the insanity of the refugee invasion of Europe was unfolding and he observed a great disparity between what was being portrayed in the mainstream media and the independent videos surfacing on the internet. Walter’s background of specializing in strategic messaging provides a unique perspective on what he calls the “old-fashioned-controlled-media” and his book outlines the tricks that have been used to propagandize the “refugee crisis.” We discuss Chancellor Angela Merkel’s horrible failure at managing the invasion in Germany, and the resulting unprecedented pressure on its health care system, infrastructure, and public services. Richmond outlines some disturbing figures concerning the European housing market and its millions of homeless natives, and the lawlessness that has ensued as special interests groups bend over backwards to provide shelter to migrants. We look at techniques the media is using to craft fairytales about the people of the refugee flood, a disturbing percentage of which are fighting age men and child soldiers with zero education who never intend to assimilate or return to their countries of origin. At the end, Walter emphasizes how EU countries that have been placed on the fast track to multiculturalization are enacting insane policies designed to dismiss and even protect migrant criminals, rapists and murderers while ensuring these savages aren’t unduly offended by ancient European traditions and practices.

Title: Stefan Jacobsson - Facing Sweden's Crisis: Politics, Identity & Culture - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=tjGVxJWauVQ
Description: Stefan Jacobsson, was born and raised in Gothenburg, Sweden. At the age of 16 he joined the now-defunct National Youth (later the Swedish Resistance Movement), and in 2006 he left the organization and worked for several years as an independent Nationalist. Jacobsson became involved with the Party of Swedes (SVP) in 2011, and in 2013 he was unanimously elected as leader of the SVP. The party was dissolved in 2015, and in November he was elected as Secretary General in the Alliance for Peace and Freedom (APF). He is also one of the main figures in Logik Förlag (Logik Publishing). 

Stefan is with us to discuss the Swedish political climate and the collective environment of Sweden as a whole. He begins with some history of the Party of Swedes, the reasons for his decision to close down the party, and what wasn’t working for the movement. Jacobsson sights difficulties in competing with the Sweden Democrats, a party that has notoriously opposed immigration, but has moved to a softer, more politically correct stance. We explore the cultural condition of Sweden, focusing on the conformist mentality of Swedes, and the role that the liberal mainstream media has played in whitewashing the full consequences of disastrous policies that have brought the country to its knees. Stefan addresses the values at the core of the SVP and accusations that the political ideology was based in National Socialism. Then, Stefan details how he has seen the overall moral foundations of Swedes manipulated and denigrated by deceitful detractors during his time in Nationalist movement. He gives a promising forecast for Sweden’s phase of strengthening and improvement that is taking shape, highlighting some of the aims of the APF. 

In the members’ hour, we address strategies for engaging in the meta-political battle to awaken the Swedish people and organize the ones who are already lit with discontent. We consider how we can reinvigorate a proud sense of achievement and encourage more of the great contributions that made European civilization uniquely exceptional. Stefan affirms that the complexity of the message must not be oversimplified and by striking at the heart and essence of the European folk, a profound realization of what’s at stake will inspire change. We look at the key elements of revitalizing a healthy sense of family values and self-reliance and taking a stand to build viable futures for our dear children. Stefan emphasizes concentrating on the emotional impact of the demographic suicide Europeans are being faced with in readying them for a true opposition to globalism and the ruthless targeting of Whites. Later, we discuss changes to the Swedish constitution making it legal for the military to be deployed against the people, and how we can work within the system that is already in place to eradicate corruption, change to a nationalistic point of view, and get more people cooperating to rebuild Sweden’s identity.

Title: Stephen E. Flowers - Restoring the Indo-European Religion: Zoroastrianism, Germanic Paganism...
Date: 2016-03-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=VomiUEsqvAg
Description: Stephen E. Flowers - Restoring the Indo-European Religion: Zoroastrianism, Germanic Paganism, & Rune Magic - Hour 1

Stephen Edred Flowers, also known by the pen-name Edred Thorsson, is an American Runologist and proponent of occultism, Germanic mysticism, Odinism, esoteric runosophy, Asatru, and Mazdaism. He is known for being instrumental in the early establishment of the Germanic Neopagan movement in North America and has been involved in Left-Hand Path organizations. Flowers has hundreds of published papers and over three dozen books, including “The Good Religion” and the forthcoming release, “Original Magic”. Flowers is currently director of the Woodharrow Institute of Germanic Studies and the owner and operator of Runa-Raven Press.

Stephen begins by discussing his vision for rejuvenating the Indo-European way through a revival of well-founded Germanic traditions and the restoration of traditional areas of study that are being eliminated from academia. He explains the foundations of the Mazdan tradition and its ultimate goal of attaining happiness in the here and now, and he speaks to the importance of preserving the heroic myths that our ancestors would evoke to organize and motivate societies. We talk about the centuries-long, coercive Christianization process that eroded away the ancient organic values of Indo-European folk-groups and flipped the true position of humanity on its head with the idea of original sin. Stephen highlights his understanding of the connection between the formation of the Germanic religion and the Zoroastrian way, and he emphasizes how the absence of culturally conditioned images allowed different cultural spheres to develop according to a veneration for their own symbols, myths and rituals.

In the members’ segment, Flowers talks about ancient horse domestication and the profoundness of the great myth of the American frontier. Then, Stephen explains the history of the Germanic writing system called the Runes and the relationship between the theory of magic and the mystical study of runes. We discuss rune magic, the use of artistic, mythical components in conveying messages, and the function of rune stones in immortalizing the dead and instilling motivation for group survival. We also touch on the application of runes in self-transformation, which Stephen says can be used to facilitate communications between one’s conscious and unconscious mind and in activating the spirit. Additionally, Stephen gives recommendations for inspiring a sense of spirituality and purpose through self-exploration and bonding with other like-minded individuals in real life. At the end, we consider the Persian Empire’s role in spreading the Aryan traditions of community and rights for all living things.

Title: Brandon Martinez - Neocon Globalism & Kalergi's Plan to Genocide Europeans - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=s1VkIiJ6k1g
Description: Brandon Martinez is an independent writer and journalist from Canada who specializes in foreign policy issues, international affairs and 20th and 21st century history. For years he has written on Zionism, Israel-Palestine, American and Canadian foreign policy, war, terrorism and deception in media and politics. He is the author of “Grand Deceptions, Hidden History and The ISIS Conspiracy.” 

In the first hour, Brandon outlines some of the new content that will be included in the forthcoming second edition of “Grand Deceptions.” The book covers the Zionist origins of the “War on Terror” beginning with 9/11 and the strategies that have been used in Syria, Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan throughout the entire Neocon conspiracy to create a clash of civilizations in the Middle East. Brandon details how the migrant crisis in Europe is part of a Zionist plot to weaken the West and break down the countries surrounding Israel in their quest for expansion. We look at the Jewish elite’s tactic of creating a divide in the consensus over the multicultural experiment, along with promoting activism aimed at exacerbating divisions through identity politics. Brandon goes into the history of Cultural Marxism and the Zionist Frankfurt School agenda to break down Western society. He also explains how Muslims are being used as willing pawns in the psychological war against Whites that is designed to produce a disillusionment of ethnic homogeneity so as to further the long-term Coudenhove-Kalergi goal of creating a “Eurasian-Negroid” mongrel globalist slave race. Then, we discuss how legitimate Nationalist movements concerned with the Islamic diaspora are being hijacked by Zionist Neocon agents like Pegida UK who are openly supporting Israel, creating a schizophrenic reaction to the issue of forced multiculturalism. 

In the members’ hour, we address the problems we face in bringing awareness to the general populace of the Zionist scheme against Whites while promoting self-determination for all peoples on Earth. Brandon says that we must take a moralistic approach to opposing the agenda to destroy Europe and avoid emanating the holier-than-thou attitudes of the evil elites we oppose. We get into the issue of Jewish supremacy and the fact that Islamization of the West is looked at as punishment for the Christian persecution of Jews 100s of years ago, and the holocaust can be invoked at any time to silence any “anti-Semitism” coming from “gentiles.” We also discuss the myth of the 6 million that has been part of an ages-old religious narrative of a Jewish messiah’s return to Earth. Further, we emphasize how the cultural disruption in Europe resulting from mass immigration serves as a smoke screen for more purging of Syrians and other Middle Easterners in Israel’s psychopathic push to expand territory and control more oil and water resources. Later, our focus turns to the tremendous task it is to power forth and continue the quest of exposing the root cause of our world’s decaying condition.

Title: Sofia Smallstorm - Transformers: How Federal Grant Money is Buying You Globalism - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=WtS0NbsO_cA
Description: Sofia Smallstorm is known for the documentaries “9/11 Mysteries” and “Unraveling Sandy Hook.” Sofia is also recognized for her research on the connections between geoengineering and synthetic biology. 

Sofia joins us for a discussion about the federal grant money that is paving the way to America’s future under Agenda 21. In the first half, she explains how the United States of America, the federal government and Washington, DC were incorporated in 1871, creating a federal corporation franchise system that encompasses all cities, towns and local agencies. Sofia defines what it means to for local governments to accept grant money from and do contractual business with the federal government and how this essentially adds to its trillions of dollars of debt. Sofia says this borrowed money is paying for New World Order changes that are aimed at ushering in a new version of humanity, and the migrant floods taking place all over the West are just part of the plan to exchange its current populations for a more easily controlled mishmash of genderless, raceless cogs. Then, we discuss the militarization grants being awarded to cities and towns that agree to participate in active shooter drills, and how it is possible for our commercialized government to make decisions that are not representative of the peoples’ interests. 

In the members’ half, Sofia gets into the huge debt that the UN is taking on to fund its own migrant invasion, and we look at how the load of this population replacement will be dumped on the people. We talk about projections of Africa’s population quadrupling, and the fact that migration to Europe is promoted there as a way to punish the evil colonialists, which contradicts the big lie that predominately White countries will be enriched through more diversity. Further, we consider how race mixing is being marketed and endorsed in the US, and how people are being programmed to accept a world reconfigured by gender bending chemicals. Sofia emphasizes the idea that our reproductive rights could someday be handled by the same government corporation that exploits humans for funds and resources through a little contract known as a birth certificate. As our conversation rounds off, we reflect on some of the problems we face as toxic overload is permanently altering the genetic components of humans, and how to balance the autonomic nervous system for optimal health.

Title: Alex Gabler & Melissa M??s - American Born Returning To Europe - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-03-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Vi7eCoJo-m4
Description: Melissa Meszaros and Alex Gabler are two American born women who returned to their ancestral homelands in Europe. Melissa lives in Hungary where she teaches and translates English, works in a caf?and periodically makes videos for her YouTube channel. Alex has traveled around 12 different European countries over the past six years and is now living in Germany where she writes occasionally for the EuropeanGuardian.com. 

Melissa and Alex are with us to discuss their individual experiences living in Europe and what the social and political climates are like compared to the United States. Melissa talks about how the influx of migrants in Hungary over last summer triggered her awakening to the anti-White and pro-refugee politics that have become so prominent in the West. Alex relates how she discovered a double standard in mainstream media reporting concerning the serious rape epidemic in Germany that has been brought on by the refugee invasion. We look at the styles of formal European schooling and social etiquette, along with the typically conservative way of life that is prominent in smaller villages. Then, we discuss the missing conservative element in mainstream politics and what spurs on more extreme stances and we examine the range of feminist ideals that shows a clear contrast between what is accepted in the US and in Europe. The conversation ends with thoughts on the resurgence of traditional values being seen within the Millennial generation, and the growing awareness that Europeans must band together with the goal of preserving heritage and preventing the extinction of our people.

Title: Christopher Jon Bjerknes - Albert Einstein: The Myth, the Plagiarist & the Zionist - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=T1TUqw96iVw
Description: Christopher Jon Bjerknes is a writer and researcher who has published numerous books and articles on the history of the theory of relativity, Einstein, Zionism and the Armenian Genocide. “Albert Einstein: The Incorrigible Plagiarist” and “Mileva Einstein-Marity: Einstein’s Partner in Crime” are among Bjerknes’ most controversial works. 

In the first half, Christopher describes the evidence pointing to Albert Einstein's plagiarism of Hendrik Lorentz and countless other physicists in his development of the theory of relativity. He talks about Einstein the Zionist and the “Einstein Terror” – a Semitic method of suppression that was used to literally terrorize and imprison anyone who dared question the dogma of Einstein. We get into Einstein’s soured reputation in Germany and the big hype surrounding his arrival in New York City, where he relocated in order to specifically promote Zionism. Christopher illustrates how Einstein manipulated credit for the E=mc² formula and failed to understand the basic concept of space time. We touch on the gravitational wave theory being hyped in the scientific press today and the costly reinforcement of flawed experimentation that is deliberately leading Western science away from technologies being advanced in Israel. Then, Christopher gets into the role that Mileva Einstein-Marity played in turning Einstein’s theoretical ideas into formal mathematical theories. We also put focus on the development of the pop culture icon of Einstein and the impact this cultish persuasion has had on the foundations of Western civilization. 

In the members’ half, Christopher details Einstein’s instrumental role in the Zionist agenda and the fact that he was treasonous to his own people and despised Europeans. We look at the Freemason Coudenhove-Kalergi’s founding ideology of the European Union and the banking moguls who funded an explicit plan to weaken the European people, lift up the so-called masterful and morally superior Jewish people, and fulfill the ancient messianic prophecy of world rule as declared in the Talmud and Kabballah. Christopher points to other pseudo-Christian kabbalists like Isaac Newton who were instrumental in promoting the Christian Zionist movement. He explains the implications of the concept of “as above, so below” in relation to the psychological, technical and religious warfare that has been unleashed by Jews to propagate political movements designed to quickly bring forth prophetic conditions. Further, Bjerknes emphasizes how the current rise of Islam in Europe is part of an ancient plan to annihilate Christians via the Muslim hand. We consider how Whites have been programmed with the belief of their original sin, and how Islamic teachings justify and encourage the mass raping and slaughter of “white devils.” Later, we look at the infiltration of Zionist interests within the US White House, and the modern liberal tactic of subverting the Western world from within. At the end, Christopher talks about the Anno Lucis dating system and highlights what the New Testament says about the 2500-year-old conspiracy to genocide all gentiles.

Title: Bob Whitaker & Tom Bowie - The US Presidential Candidate Fighting White Genocide - Hour 1
Date: 2016-02-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=eiztH9MdUD4
Description: Bob Whitaker is running for president on the American Freedom Party (AFP) ticket. He has been a college professor, international aviation negotiator, Capitol Hill staffer, Reagan Administration appointee, and writer for the Voice of America. Whitaker has written numerous articles and three books, and is perhaps best known for being the creator of The Mantra, a strategy to fight White Genocide. Tom Bowie is the AFP Vice Presidential running mate. He has been a member of the US Marine Corps and the Maryland Defense Force. Bowie formed a STAR (State Tactical and Response) Team, chartered an Explorer troop under the Boy Scouts of America, and has worked with the State of Maryland Department of Health as a Health and Safety Specialist and a Special Police Officer.

The AFP candidates join us for an overview of the party’s running platform, which is centered on stopping the immigration invasion, fighting White genocide, and conquering cultural Marxism. Bob talks about the development of The Mantra, a tool of repetition aimed at leveling the field of free speech in America and taking on the thought police who work diligently to squash conversations about the anti-White scam chipping away at the country’s foundations. We discuss how the party is addressing the so-called “race problem” in America by hammering away at the mantras of “Diversity = White Genocide” and “Anti-Racist is a Code Word for Anti-White,” and we get into the controversial banning of billboards across the country. Tom talks about the true definition of white genocide and the skillful word spinning tactics the political elite use to promote “diversity” while detracting from the agenda of doing away with the White race.

In the members’ half, we look at the central issue of the US government turning against the best interests of its own people, and how Donald Trump is riding the wave of discontented Americans fed up with anti-White politics. Bob and Tom explain how a 3rd party can use the state election process to its advantage to grab ballot ticks from the huge chunk of independent voters that are disgusted with the system and ready to hitch on to a revolution. We weigh up the crumbling components of the Democrat vs Republican system and tired cuckservative campaigning schemes. At the end, the AFP campaign manager Laura Fitz-Gerald comes on and informs folks how to get involved in the upcoming primary elections.

Title: Daniel Carlsen - Party of the Danes: For the Future of Denmark - Hour 1
Date: 2016-02-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2lZ8ebEGswA
Description: Daniel Carlsen is the leader of the Party of the Danes, or Danskernes Parti. Born in 1990, he graduated from high school in 2009. In the period between August 2009 and April 2010, Daniel served his military time as a Royal Life Guard, protecting the Danish castles and the royal family. In 2012 Daniel got an Academy Profession Degree in Marketing Management. 

In the first segment, Daniel gives an overview of the time spent during his youth in the public school system in Denmark’s second largest city, Aarhus, where he began to understand the reality of his country’s rapidly changing demographics and the immigration issue. This led him to get engaged in political activism at an early age, and consequently in 2011 Carlsen and a group of other likeminded Danes built Danskernes Parti. Daniel speaks about some of the different political ideologies that define Denmark, including one he was a former member of, the Danish People’s Party. He describes the general social climate within some of the metropolitan areas of his small country, which host immigrant ghettos functioning as parallel societies with the equivalent of Sharia law governance. Daniel highlights Denmark’s population statistics, the symbolic laws that are in place to address the needs of asylum seekers, and the EU regulations that are designed to give “global diversity” a leg up within this tiny percentage of the world’s population. Further, we get into the negative consequences of the Schengen Zone and the real possibility of Denmark becoming one of Europe’s first Sharia zones via the open door policy that has essentially rolled out a red carpet for the world’s “refugees.” 

In the members’ segment, we discuss how a renewed sense of nationalism is the first step to addressing concerns about the future of the Danish people. Daniel talks about Scandinavia’s unique media climate and how political events that Party of the Danes has participated in are being portrayed in the mainstream news. We consider the historical period in Germany that was defined by National Socialism, and we look optimistically to an updated nationalist movement’s ability to address Europe’s current territorial issues while invigorating a sense of national pride, dedication, veneration for culture, and appreciation for heritage. Then, we focus on the fundamental core of the Germanic peoples that is rooted in a deep regard for familial values and tradition – a structure that is being quickly eroded with large movements of foreign populations. Can we stop globalization? Will the Northern Europe’s native populations be pushed even further past the periphery? In conclusion, Daniel covers the goals of Danskernes Parti and their strategic plan to be represented in Parliament in order to address issues that will give the people of Denmark hope and trust in the survival of her people.

Title: Jon Rappoport, Dr. Sherri Tenpenny & Andreas Bachmair - Zika Virus “Outbreak”...
Date: 2016-02-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=L8nLPBXZfUA
Description: Jon Rappoport, Dr. Sherri Tenpenny & Andreas Bachmair - Zika Virus “Outbreak” & The Vaccine Industry - Hour 1

Jon Rappoport has worked as a free-lance investigative reporter for over 30 years. He is the author of several books, including “AIDS, Inc.: Scandal of the Century.” He is behind the website NoMoreFakeNews.com. Dr. Sherri J. Tenpenny, founder of Tenpenny Integrative Medical Center in Middleburg, Ohio, has been board certified in Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine since 1995. She has written two best-selling books, “FOWL! Bird Flu: It’s Not What You Think” and “Saying No To Vaccines: A Resource Guide for All Ages.” Andreas Bachmair is a German homeopath physician with a practice in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. The focus of his work for over a decade has been the treatment of vaccine-related injuries. This led him to create the website VaccineInjury.info. He is also the author of the newly released book, “Sarah Doesn’t Want to be Vaccinated.” 

Our three returning guests join us for a discussion on the dangerous affair of vaccines and the misleading propaganda being peddled by infectious disease agencies. We begin with an in-depth look into the latest “outbreak” hysteria centered on Zika, where the main controversy of the mosquito born virus cropping up in Brazil is being linked to microcephaly in newborn babies by the World Health Organization. Jon gives the generalities of the fraudulent science backing the WHO’s claims and he explains how this scare is being used as a psyop to cover up another serious problem. Sherri talks about the recent MMR vaccine campaign that led to the re-vaccination of around 39,000 women of child bearing age in Brazil, and she lays out how the Zika virus being labeled as an international emergency could allow an epic opportunity for the big-pharma-funded FDA to roll out a mass utilization of untested vaccinations. In addition, we get into the incestuous affairs of the “virus hunter” branch of the CDC, along with their ties to the mainstream press and the giant pesticide corporations that are making big bucks in Brazil. 

In the members’ segment, we address some of the foundations of the vast vaccine debate. Andreas talks about the online survey he’s been collecting for over five years in order to study different illnesses in unvaccinated vs. vaccinated children. We consider the 1.3 trillion dollar worldwide pharmaceutical industry’s cornerstone business of vaccine production and the scam statistics that keep these toxic concoctions flowing through the medical marketplace. Then, we discuss the immune system’s natural defense mechanisms, the false premise that humans should never get sick, and the benefits of naturally occurring of childhood diseases. We put focus on the deadly HPV vaccine, Gardasil, and the horrible implications that this reproductive system destroying inoculation is another device to stop the growth of certain populations. Further, we deliberate the huge moneymaking scam of the National Cancer Institute’s futile attempts to find a link between viruses and cancer. The conversation rounds off with a look at the deeper issue of why vaccines are falsely promoted as protection for the young, the old, and the chronically ill.

Title: Adam - Eurotunnel Insider Speaks Out on Waves of Migrants
Date: 2016-02-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=TG-cveGhgLI
Description: Adam has worked for many years as a firefighter at the Eurotunnel fire station and with Kent Fire and Rescue service. He joins us to give an insider account of the myriad of incidents with illegal immigrants he has dealt with and witnessed at the Eurotunnel site, where the Fire and Rescue service has been pulled into the role of searching the trains and tunnels for foreign trespassers. Beginning in the summer of2015, a massive explosion of immigrants crossing from Calais to Dover has inundated French Police and Eurotunnel security, with an estimated 57,000 illegals removed from the French terminal in 2015 alone. We talk about the French ferry worker strike that brought mainstream attention to the migrant crisis, when the press broke with the story of the massive organized invasion of 1500 migrants storming the channel tunnel via the Calais terminal. Adam gives details of the different strategies employed by the desperate travelers who stow away on freight lorries or trains, or even walk, as a means to get through to the UK’s generous asylum seeker benefits. He speaks about the dangerous diseases that are making their way through and costing the UK health service billions of pounds per year, along with the UK financed, £12,000,000 fence being constructed around the Calais terminal perimeter that has actually made it easier for invaders to cross. Adam says that anywhere from 100-150 migrants armed with knives and iron bars are funneling through to the UK each day, and the dire consequences can be seen in the skyrocketing crime rates and the numbers of unaccompanied “children” that require rehoming, among other frightening figures related to the economy. Later, we look at the major obstacle of political correctness that is keeping European governments from properly addressing this mass invasion, and we discuss whether or not the outdated Schengen Zone agreement will be modified in an attempt to quell the fresh surge of migrants forecast to hit Europe come spring.

Title: Jordan Maxwell - Liberation into Subversion: The World Revolution Movement - Hour 1
Date: 2016-02-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=w6id3FsSNfk
Description: Jordan Maxwell continues as a researcher and an independent scholar in the field of occult / religious philosophy. His interest in these subjects began as far back as 1959. He has conducted dozens of intensive seminars, hosted his own radio talk shows, guested on more than 600 radio shows, and has written, produced and appeared in numerous television shows and documentaries, including the five-part Ancient Mystery Series. 

Jordan returns to Red Ice for another look into what has created the catastrophic times we’re living in and where we are headed. He points to an old operation known as the World Revolution Movement that began in the early 1700s with secret fraternal orders in Europe as the leading edge behind our world class scene of chaos. We look at the corrupt institutions guiding this crusade – from the government to the banking industry, the military industrial complex and the education system – all of which Jordan says are being controlled by evil forces. Jordan talks about how human progress is being destroyed through a highly orchestrated and heavily financed Marxist experiment in cultural subversion, with America “liberation” and Hollywood at the forefront of the overall transvaluation of societal values. We discuss the liberal progressive agenda that came out of the opposition to fascism and National Socialism, which, with the aid of marketing, social engineering and manipulation, has now shifted mankind towards a profound state of ignorance and degeneracy. Further, we get into who produced the “American Dream” ideal and all its materialistic promises of liberty, justice and freedom. 

In the members’ segment, we look at recent developments in the US political system, with the openly socialist Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders running as democrats. Jordan expands upon the fact that all communist governments are referred to politically as the “people’s democratic republics,” and that the American system has been infiltrated with communist ideology since the days of Marx and Lenin. We also discuss how the banking families of America and England financed the Bolshevik communist party. Then, we consider how thousands of years of rule by tyrants and war lords vying for worldwide control has been made possible through the promotion of terrorism, violence, drugs, alcoholism, brainlessness, and all things corrupt. Jordan illustrates why he believes there is a wicked hand, not from this world guiding humanity into the abyss. Later, we analyze the attack on the European nations, surging tide of social unrest and violence that has been brought on by the foreign Islamic invasion and what looks to be a coordinated effort by EU leaders to push a major clash of civilizations.

Title: Richard Thomas - Power Through Discipline: The Plague of Weak Men - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-02-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kkcOJliFj3E
Description: Richard Thomas was formerly behind Truth Militia and the Truth Militia Radio Network. He now runs a new website, Power Through Discipline, and hosts a weekly radio show: PTD Radio. Rich's new project focuses on rebuilding our men, our families, and the communities we live in by developing power through hardcore discipline. 

Rich is with us to discuss his mission at PTD, where he’s working through a holistic approach to implement solutions to the main problem we face today in America and the rest of the Western World: a lack of REAL men. By zeroing in on health, fitness, nutrition, family values and spirituality, Rich promotes practical measures to tackle the weak, soft, beaten down, and feminized mindset that has become the hallmark of men in the West. Rich talks about the need for self-sacrifice, dedication and hard work in transcending the lazy, victimhood mentality plaguing men and women in this modern age of convenience and instant gratification. Rich says that it’s time to own up to and fix the catastrophic mistakes that have led us to our current mess – out of control feminism, wicked cultural and social Marxism, and obnoxious political correctness. We look at the leadership qualities of powerful men like Donald Trump, along with the importance of strong, confident, well-spoken father figures setting examples for our sons and daughters. Rich emphasizes the crucial aspect of getting involved on a local level to ensure the rich fabric of American society is not diluted with 3rd world standards. We round off the conversation with practical solutions for overcoming personal limitations and achieving optimal physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing.

Title: Augustus Sol Invictus - Libertarian Realism: Folk, Culture & Borders - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-02-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=jWHKfaLwFk4
Description: Augustus Invictus is an attorney and community leader in Orlando, Florida who is a candidate in the 2016 US Senate election. Best known as a radical philosopher and infamous social critic, he is Managing Partner of Imperium, P.A., the law firm he founded in 2013. As an attorney, Augustus has worked to defend those who have become collateral damage of America’s two longest-running wars: the War on Drugs and the War on Terror. 

Augustus begins with an explanation of the name he has chosen to identify with, along with the mystical path that led him to study law and eventually pursue politics. He talks about his affiliation with the Libertarian Party (LP) and the problems he sees with its watered down, mainstream message. Augustus describes the main issues he aspires to tackle as Senator: the drug war, foreign policy, and the financial crisis. We get into the customary LP stances on open borders, immigration and equality, and we look at how these key concerns have been muddled with leftist contention. Augustus shares his view on the problems that will ensue for Libertarian ideals if non-Westerners continue to flood into America, and he also speaks to the Marxist degeneracy that has infected pop culture and the educational system. Then, we discuss the absence of natural law and hierarchy in the current US government system, along with the tyrannical forces pushing oppressive mandatory regulations, censorship and hate speech laws. At the end, Augustus sums up the actions he is taking to tackle the looney left’s war on White men and inspire a resurrection of the American front.

Title: Alt Right 2016 - John Morgan, Greg Johnson, Daniel Friberg, Richard Spencer & RamzPaul
Date: 2016-02-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0sRlSIAAzUE
Description: John Morgan is Editor-in-Chief and co-founder of Arktos Media. He is also one of the editors of the new Right On website. Greg Johnson is Editor-in-Chief of Counter Currents. He is the author of "Confessions of a Reluctant Hater," "New Right vs. Old Right," and the newly published “Truth, Justice, & a Nice White Country.” Daniel Friberg is a founding member of the Swedish metapolitical think-tank Motpol. He is also the co-founder and CEO of Arktos Media and author of "The Real Right Returns.” Richard Spencer is President of National Policy Institute (NPI) and Editor of Washington Summit Publishers and Radix Journal. Ramzpaul is known for his iconoclastic YouTube channel that mocks cultural Marxism and pokes fun at the establishment and contemporary politics through satire and humor.

For this roundtable, we bring together some notable and recognizable figures in the Alt Right scene. We begin by looking back on 2015, a year when we witnessed unprecedented chaos in Europe and a remarkable Western culture awakening. We discuss how an array of events – from the refugee crisis in Europe, to the Ferguson and #blacklivesmatter riots in US, and the Paris attacks – all spurred on a mass realization that the tired left/liberal and mainstream conservative aphorisms and tactics have lost traction. Richard speaks to the inspiring numbers of new people that are being “red-pilled” every day, which has resulted in a high demand for a completely new alternative to the bankrupt mainstream. We look at ways in which we can drive the Alt Right movement in a positive direction and offer a tangible vision for those who are craving something new. Greg describes how ideas coming out of the Alt Right, like the Cuckservative meme, are now driving mainstream debates, and Daniel emphasizes the importance of focusing on metapolitics as a means to shape a cultural cleanup. Then, we get into the differing concepts of White Nationalism and Ethno Nationalism, and whether or not Europe has something to learn from America in terms of racial identity, or if breaking up into separate, sovereign nations is the answer to the ages-old Western ethnic rivalry.

In the second hour, Ramzpaul explains how he employs a comedic slant to get around censorship while conveying his message in a nonthreatening way. We discuss the tremendous opportunities that exist in the Alt Right for talented individuals to produce low-cost media content with a core message, and brainstorm ways to encourage meetups, community building, and the recruitment of other like-minded folks to support and join the cause. We talk about some of the obstacles that we face with censorship policies on social networking platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as the excellent propaganda that is generated from controversies that end up being covered by the MSM. We get into the power of trolling, the great advantage of the decentralized nature of the Alt Right, and the fact that this instinctually driven movement is the sexiest alternative to any snively SJW popularity contest. In closing, John emphasizes the exciting prospect that the Alt Right is well on its way to becoming the new counter culture, as it is by far the only true opposition with true rebel status.

Title: Andy Nowicki - Conspiracy & The Alt-Right - Hour 1
Date: 2016-02-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=RfXkiZuxKL0
Description: Andy Nowicki lives and works in Savannah, Georgia as the assistant editor of the online magazine, Alternative Right. Nowicki is also the author of several books, including “The Columbine Pilgrim,” “Heart Killer,” “Confessions of a Would-Be Wanker,” “Considering Suicide” and “Notes Before Death.” 

Andy is with us to talk about his latest book, “Conspiracy, Compliance, Control and Defiance,” which he describes as a meta-conspiritual analysis of the nature of power and the contemporary ruling class. We discuss the connotative meanings of the term “conspiracy theory” and the idea that people who ascend to the top are typically the most prone to ruthlessness and backstabbing. We consider how events like 9/11 and Sandy Hook have been meticulously exploited to push certain agendas that further a totalitarian regime. Andy gives his perspective on what it’s like to be a “closet truther” questioning the reality of the mainstream portrayal of tragic events, and eventually realizing the sheer magnitude of evil that is at play. Then, Andy defines the characteristics of what he calls “our Reptilian rulers,” who have the capacity to commit crimes against the innocent with a terrifying degree of cold-blooded malevolence while still being revered as upstanding leaders. We get into the sophisticated game of manipulation that our top politicians have mastered and polished to perfection, albeit at times stupendously failing. 

In the members’ segment, Andy continues on the nature of the reptile, how we can understand what we’re dealing with, and what can be done. He draws some distinctions between the common sociopath and the reptilian, both of whom display a definitive lack of love, conscience and remorse, but the latter demonstrating an ambitious lust for power and an active, sadistic desire to prey upon and hurt others. We discuss the R-complex part of the triune brain and the theory that sociopathic leaders associate more with this primal, calculating and sometimes unpredictable operating center. Then, we discuss how marketing and propaganda is designed to appeal to the reptilian brain, and we consider how difficult it is for the average person to first find the time and then the drive to wade through the mountains of conspiracies that are engineered to create confusion. Later, we focus on the great divide that exists within the Alt Right concerning conspiracy theories, and we emphasize the importance of setting aside particulars to clear the way for a mission of truth and perseverance that will break the cycle of the West’s current cultural decline.

Title: Insight - White Girls Black Dolls: Destroying White Bias
Date: 2016-01-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=4UoZisxgxgE
Description: Lana provides an alternative view to the Kenneth Clark's 1940s doll study and provides the historical background that connects the American Civil Rights Movement, Communism and the Frankfurt School. After Hitler, Jewish intellectuals pushed critical theory as a means to destroy Western Civilization and "potential fascists." We'll fast forward to today and see these ideas in action, ultimately seeking the total obliteration of White people. White girls loving White dolls is racism but Black girls loving Black dolls is self love?

Title: Brian Anse Patrick - Zombies & PropaGUNda - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=bAjRt0gdQLc
Description: Dr. Brian Anse Patrick is a professor of communication at the University of Toledo. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in research methods, group communication, propaganda and persuasion. He is also a nationally recognized expert on American gun culture as well as the author of many scholarly papers and books, including “The Ten Commandments of Propaganda,” “Zombology: Zombies and the Decline of the West (and Guns)” and his forthcoming release, “PropaGUNda: The Informational War over Guns.”

In the first hour, Brian talks about the rise of the zombie phenomenon, which he calls the premier archetype of modern times. We compare the original, minion-like, brain-eating zombie under the control of evil forces with the modern day, mass society version of autonomy – braindead cogs plugged into a constant stream of entertainment and self-affirming social media. Brian relates this trend to the UFO craze - a visionary rumor that bloomed out of the high-anxiety climate of the nuclear age and the Cold War. He says the zombie trend is a signal of cultural decline and a general breakdown of civil society, and it has that ultimate death head symbol appeal. We look at Hollywood depictions of the Zombie archetype and the common theme of a few armed individuals responding to uncontrolled outbreaks of the living dead. Brian illustrates how the zombie outlet serves a function as a projection of what is forbidden to be feared and hated about society. Further, we connect the government’s subsidization of low-level behaviors to a general decline in intelligence and the looming collapse of Western culture.

In the members’ hour, we get into the spike in gun sales in Europe that resulted from the Cologne sex attacks, and we consider what’s causing the surge of women entering gun culture in America. Brian describes the steps to selecting an appropriate weapon and getting the proper training, he defines the laws of self-defense, and highlights potential repercussions for exercising 2nd Amendment rights. We also talk about the deeply traditional and ceremonial significance of hunting and Brian gives recommendations for efficient rifles. Later, Brian discusses common idiosyncrasies of many university professors – our chief administrators of cultural Marxist ideologies – who are leading the way towards the internal colonization of citizens. As we round things off, Brian touches on Donald Trump’s very Aristotle-like qualities, his decidedly old and wrinkled competition, and the psychopathic penchants of past presidents.

Title: Marcus Follin, Justin Garcia & Paul Waggener - Man Up to the Invasion - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=mQ3x2B-abEU
Description: Marcus Follin produces the popular YouTube channel, The Golden One, which focuses on masculinity, strength training and metapolitics. He studies Economics and is a contributor at RightOn.net, an online resource for the rising True Right of Europe. 

Justin Garcia, aka “Master Chim,” is behind The Pressure Project podcast and The Jungle Gym martial arts academy. His mission and work is centered on empowering men to reclaim what masculinity once was and fighting cultural Marxism. 

Paul Waggener is a founding member of Wolves of Vinland, a tribal organization with chapters across America that exists to pressure the strengthening of character amongst its folk. Operation Werewolf is the creation of Paul and the banner under which the Wolves operate around the world. 

In this roundtable, Marcus, Justin, Paul and Henrik address some key issues currently facing the men of Western civilization. We begin with a look into the recent Cologne sex attacks and the numerous other assaults that have been perpetrated by foreign “rapefugees” across Europe. Marcus gives his perspective on the dangerous mix brewing within Sweden, as culturally incompatible invaders bring with them a set of rules that starkly opposes the moral codes and sense of honor of high trust societies. The overarching strategy for managing this kind of violent threat to the social order is through man’s commitment to physical fitness and intimate relationships with warrior ethos, tribalism and violence. We consider the ideas of self-sacrifice and staying within the bounds of the system as we grapple with the task of returning our societal standards to the highest good. Paul says that we must act with pure hearts, strong limbs and actions matching words. Then, we get into what it takes to create strong networks and tribes, defend our borders, women and children, and combat the dividing forces of 3rd wave feminism and cultural Marxism. 

In the second hour, we focus on the opportunities that the immigrant invasion has presented for the West in reexamining the importance of masculinity and stepping up to the generation’s challenge of restoring natural law and order. We discuss the benefits of leading a physically fit life and strategies for maintaining motivation. Justin defines the tribalist mindset in relation to nationalism, and he talks about honing a sense of self-worth that is impervious to all of the tired stereotypes and name calling associated with going against the liberal grain. Paul gets into the mission of Operation Werewolf and he illustrates the significance of a unified appearance amongst tribal folk. Then, we make some predictions for summertime, when another massive wave of migrants is forecast to descend upon Europe, and we look at strategies for upcoming pivotal phase of US politics. At the end, the group zeroes in on the value of tribe and steps for producing solidarity and success as we work to unify and strengthen our folk.

Title: Kristoffer Hell - Democracy to Death: Sweden’s Path to Disintegration & Palme Assassination - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=sddwp97_EX0
Description: Kristoffer Hell is a geopolitical analyst and writer who operates Blueshift.nu, and a related activist site, Radda Sverige (Save Sweden). A hallmark of Kristoffer's work has been the creation of online petitions on important issues, which have had an impact on Swedish politics and mobilized over 10,000 Swedes. He is the author of “Democracy to Death – Sweden’s Path into the Global Dictatorship” and “The Dark Heart of the West – 9/11, Geopolitical Terrorism & Globalization.” 

Kristoffer begins by talking about his efforts to bring awareness to some of the most pressing problems facing Sweden, such as the potential eradication of cash and the thousands of laws being voted in by Parliament each year that are encroaching on the freedoms of Swedes. He describes the European Union’s role in creating a global dictatorship, with state sponsored geopolitical terrorism financed by billionaires like George Soros. We discuss the Wallenberg banksters and the Bonnier media moguls, who together are responsible for controlling the mainstream narrative that is guilt shaming citizens into going along with the ridiculous policies thrust forth by the political elite. Kristoffer says that Sweden is in a state of freefall and system collapse, where a desperate situation is being inflamed, perhaps intentionally, by the open door immigration policy. We look at how the globalist plan of the Count of Coudenhove-Kalergi is coming to fruition in Sweden, now one of the most “diverse” and dangerous countries in Europe. 

In the members’ segment, Kristoffer gets into the history of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme and the details of his assassination in 1986. We discuss the many faces of Palme, who at one time appeared to be working against the globalist agenda. We consider the mysterious components of the submarine intrusions that linked him to the Soviet Union and an international plan to bring down Sweden. Kristoffer illustrates the many complicated facets of Palme’s background, where implications of counter intelligence spying and blackmail leave many questions surrounding a much bigger and devious deep state game of destruction. Then, we look at the long term effects of Palme’s political heritage and the role that Israel and Zionist money interests have played in the globalization game. Later, we return to the issue of Sweden becoming a cashless society and the changes to paper money that can be seen as symbolic gestures alluding to the war on the citizens and the rising technocratic system. In closing, we discuss the Swedish Democrats and its pro-Zionist leadership that has expelled true nationalists from the party.

Title: Libertarian Realist - Race Realism & Western Origins of Liberty - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PXgS2_UJegk
Description: Brad Trun is the writer and video producer known as Libertarian Realist. His YouTube channel features commentaries, satirical bits, and travelogues exposing politically incorrect realities. In 2014, he recorded travelogues in 12 US states and 21 countries, documenting demographic decline on the streets of cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, Dublin, Malmö, and Copenhagen. Libertarian Realist currently lives in Montana, where he is working on a book that will flesh out an ideology for a new ascendancy. 

Our conversation with Brad centers on the problems with open borders and the extreme leftwing ideology that ignores the cultural and biological realities that ought to sustain the foundations of any society. Brad talks about his philosophical journey of discerning the concepts that spawned libertarian ideals, including the non-aggression principle of ethics, and the system of objectivism developed by Ayn Rand. He explains Libertarian Realist ideology, which encompasses the four pillars of highly successful societies – genetics, borders, freedom and aesthetics. We discuss the Western origins of liberty and the founding traditions of America that were based in race realism and the creation of a nation comprised of people with adequate cultural understanding to live compatibly within a free society. Brad highlights where the persistent ideology of egalitarianism has perpetuated a failing system, with programs designed to close the achievement gap, such as welfare, affirmative action, and No Child Left Behind. Then, we look at how the increasingly blatant anti-White establishment and media is pushing more people away from the imposed ideals and religion of egalitarianism, and we take stock of what Trump is doing to delegitimize the nonsense of the political correctness in politics. Further, we get into the issues of anchor babies, minority votes, and the absence of immigration policies that protect the interests of citizens and enrich the population. 

In the members’ segment, we discuss the recent mass shootings in Paris and San Bernardino that have been attributed to Muslim terrorists, and we try to make some sense of the flagrant double standards that tell us Islamophobia is wrong and multiculturalism enhances society. Brad links this discounting of natural instincts to the oppressive system of political correctness and the weaponization of history. We consider how denying genetic differences and opening borders to hostile immigrants with the propensity for radicalization will ultimately lead to the destruction of Western freedoms. We look at the unsustainability of perpetual economic and population growth, and the qualitative aspects of a demographic decline. Libertarian Realist stresses the importance of harnessing realistic goals that will bring us towards the ascension of society. The discussion rounds off with an analysis of the misguided US foreign policies that have dumped billions of dollars into the egalitarian delusion that we can remake the rest of the world into our ideal image of democracy for all.

Title: Mariya Lesiv - The Return of Ancestral Gods: Modern Ukrainian Paganism - Radio 3 Fourteen
Date: 2016-01-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=21zDpig1UmI
Description: Dr. Mariya Lesiv is an Assistant Professor of Folklore at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada. Her research interests include diaspora studies, folklore and national/ethnic identity building, material culture, belief, religious folk life, and new religious movements. Mariya's first book, “The Return of Ancestral Gods: Modern Ukrainian Paganism as an Alternative Vision for a Nation,” is devoted to a new religious and political movement that strives to revive old rural folklore while creating an alternative vision for a present-day Ukrainian nation in both Ukraine and the diaspora. 

Mariya speaks about her experiences in Kiev in 2006 during a celebration marking Ukraine’s then 15-year independence from the Soviet Union, which inspired her to write “The Return of Ancestral Gods.” She describes the three dominant pagan groups featured in the book: RunVira, Ancestral Fire, and Native Faith. We discuss the political unrest that existed in Ukraine post-WWII, when many Ukrainians fled due to the fear of having their culture in the hands of Nazis and Soviets. We look at the subsequent crash of the Soviet Union that instigated a religious revival and a rise in Ukrainian paganism with a desire to connect to an alternative sense of self-identity. Mariya explains the differences of the three major pagan factions, which can be characterized by a focus on colonial politics and historical events vs. the revival of folklore and practicing aesthetics and the beauty of rituals. Further, we consider why younger pagans who identify as ethno-nationalists, separate from globalism, are more attracted to the non-political Ancestral Fire and National Faith. Mariya talks about the promotion of pan-Slavic brotherhood within the movement, along with the typical problems that modern pagans across the world have with Christianity and the spread of Western hegemony. We touch on the important pagan aspect of ethnic belongingness that goes against the American ideals of equality, tolerance and inclusiveness. Mariya concludes with some examples of how pagans are building a more powerful culture and identity through creating unique folk art and practicing sacred folk traditions.

Title: Motgift: Jonas, Dan & Magnus - Europe 2016: Attacks in Cologne & a Political Forecast - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=sMyP1SljoXE
Description: Jonas De Geer was born in Stockholm, Sweden. He's a writer, publisher, radio-personality and an activist and has been a leading personality in the opposition in Sweden since the 90’s. Dan Eriksson lives in Berlin, Germany and is Nationalistic writer, public speaker, podcaster and online video producer. He was a member of Svenskarnas Parti (Party of the Swedes). Magnus Söderman is a Swedish nationalist who is the author of several books on diverse topics relating to the struggle for Sweden, Europe and the Western world. He is a long-time street activist, political speaker and educator. During the last three years Magnus has been building Motgift with Dan and Jonas. 

Jonas, Dan and Magnus join us as we survey the events of 2015 and place the brewing culture war into context to measure up the prospects for the Nationalist movement in 2016 and beyond. The guys talk about the controversial subjects and taboo issues they’ve been addressing at Motgift and how they are working towards applying an antidote to the insanity that is denigrating Europe and Western civilization. We consider the defining moments of 2015 concerning the mounting migrant invasion, and what can be done to further expose and remedy this organized assault designed to change the ethnic and cultural makeup of our European homelands. As we have all witnessed a complete demographic transformation of the West within a couple of generations, we look into the horrific face of what will inevitably amount to more violence and dispossession along with increased militaristic tyranny if the destabilizing infection of Islam is not stopped. We take stock of the unthinkable events that transpired in Cologne, Germany on New Year’s Eve, which clearly demonstrated the irreconcilable culture clash swelling within Europe; a manufactured conflict that can be partially attributed to irrational policies enacted by a feminized government. 

In the members' segment, we examine the integrity of the Nationalist movement and what can be plainly seen as a liberalization of the founding ideals within mainstream politics. We discuss the politically correct kowtowing seen with parties such as the French Front National and the Swedish Democrats, which further validates the need for a much more radical alternative to the tired leftist rule. We speak to the strategic appeal of the New or Alt Right, centering on its ability to tackle controversial issues in an easy-going fashion while focusing on deeply traditional, uncomplicated values based in nature. Then, we dig deeper into the actions that must be taken in order to keep Europe from experiencing another full-blown Muslim takeover, the likes of which have been seen before, but have been obscured by academia’s disingenuous versions of history. Later, we look to the classic story of Beowulf and the writings of Tolkien to give us some perspective on the never-ending Earthly battle between good and evil that can only be won through determined dedication to one’s self and folk.

Title: Christina Hoff Sommers - Feminism & Its Impact on Society - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-01-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ipCJdk83Ia4
Description: Christina Hoff Sommers, a former philosophy professor who taught ethics, is probably best known for her critique of late-twentieth-century feminism. She is also known for her extensive writings, among them Who Stole Feminism?, The War Against Boys, One Nation Under Therapy & The Science on Women and Science. Her textbook, Vice and Virtue in Everyday Life, a bestseller in college ethics, is currently in its ninth edition. Her latest book is called Freedom Feminism - Its Surprising History and Why it Matters Today. She runs the Factual Feminist video blog, covering all subjects related to feminist philosophies and practices. Her #FactFem colleagues use a data-driven approach to the basic tenets of feminism and related topics.

Christina begins sharing the forgotten history of "conservative feminism" and "maternal feminism" during the 1st wave. We discuss the suffragettes and why there were many women opposed to them. We discuss a more accurate portrayal of the relationship between men and women in the suffragette era, as opposed to the radical feminist view. Then, we'll discuss 2nd wave feminism and how things went awry leading up to today's radical feminist. Christina points out the top feminist myths and denounces feminist mysandry and the all out war on boys. From male shaming to "men going their own way" we'll look at the damage modern feminism is doing to the relationship between the sexes and to society as a whole. There is nothing more fundamental & delicate than the relationship of male and female. Later, we'll speculate on what consequences, as well as backlash, may unfold to unchecked feminism and a culture of victimhood.

Title: Christopher Cantwell - Pro-White Libertarianism - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=tR17HAI0uOs
Description: Christopher Cantwell is an activist, writer, talk show host, and satirist originally from New York. Now living in New Hampshire, he hosts the Radical Agenda, discussing news and issues from a pro-white anarcho-capitalist perspective. Chris is the former co-host of the nationally broadcast radio show Free Talk Live, and his writing has been syndicated on Lew Rockwell, Economic Policy Journal, A Voice for Men, and numerous other publications pertaining to philosophy, politics, economics, race, and gender issues. 

Christopher first gives us a glimpse into the path that led him towards what he calls “common sense extremism,” which started with his involvement in the Free State Project, and later a journey down the rabbit hole of race issues. He asserts that left-leaning libertarians have an illogical association with the original and true philosophies of libertarianism that are based in the idea of private property societies. We discuss the faulty concept of open borders and the government’s program of mass immigration that is being fueled by economic incentives for cheap labor. Christopher addresses the adverse conditions that “diversity” generates when introduced within largely homogenous societies, and we consider whether or not the libertarian faction has the tenacity to stand up against subversive forces like Islam. Then, Christopher explains the r/K selection theory in relation to the proportions of liberals, conservatives and libertarians, and he links the subsidization of birth control and abortion to shrinking White populations. We also look at the definition of genocide and the UN’s planned demographic transformation of Europe, along with the realities of self-segregating cultures. 

In the members’ hour, Christopher gets into the center of the problems that are tearing apart Western civilization, namely the enemy of liberty, democracy, and the misleaders who are promoting social engineering programs designed to dumb down the masses. We talk about the Obama phenomenon and how his two-term victory could be chalked up to successfully appealing to the US’s lowest common denominator. Chris gives his perspective on the candidates for the upcoming US presidential election, focusing on how Trump’s rhetoric on immigration and race issues is helping to shift the Overton window. We chew over the conditions creating the divide that exists between left and right-leaning libertarians, and we contemplate what it will take to get the libertarian crowd to fully grasp the idea of White genocide. Christopher expresses some concerns with the Alt Right movement’s lack of focus on free market economics, and he gives props to its ability to drive a cultural dialogue that is unhindered by taboo subjects. Later, we look at the incredible potential for the West to retransform its culture and take back its power from the global elite.

Title: Robert Otey - Unscientific Cosmogony: Gravity, Quantum Physics & Einstein - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-pjwlhPjcak
Description: Robert Otey has spent the past 25 years doing research into alternative Cosmology. He is behind the YouTube channel, 77Gslinger, where he has close to 700 videos relating to the Electric Universe, Sacred Geometry, Cymatics, and the work of Walter Russell, Viktor Schauberger, DB Larson, Nikola Tesla and others. Otey is the author of two books, “Free Energy and Free Thinking” and “Gravity is a Myth and Does Not Exist; Electricity is the Only Force in the Universe.” 

Robert begins with an overview of the convincing evidence he has discovered that contradicts and debunks the flawed theoretical gravitation based/big bang cosmogony taught in academia. He states that his enormous body of work proves this is in fact an electric universe based upon the foundations of sacred geometry. He gives credit to the revolutionary free energy discoveries made by Schauberger, Tesla, Moray, and others who discarded the false models of explosion based, fuel sucking technology upheld to render astronomical profits for the world’s energy barons, war mongers and central bankers. Robert explains the main proofs behind the electric universe model and how these elements produce the effect we know as gravity. We discuss the model of magnetism, the field of quantum physics, and the nuclear atom theory. Robert talks about the two main foundations of quantum mechanics, The double-slit experiment and the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. We look at the idea of relativism in science and the deceptive language of mathematics, along with the history of Einstein and his manufactured science. Further, we consider the birth of the Nobel Prize scene and the corresponding rise of National Socialism in Germany. 

In the member segment, Otey gets into the heavily ethnocentrically promoted arena of Jewish inventions and the mythical “genius gene” that is supposedly responsible for a huge proportion of Nobel Prize winning scientific discoveries in physics. We discuss the cultural Marxist infiltration of academia and the shameless bid for control through junk technologies that is destroying Western civilization. We look at the achievements of Victor Schauberger, a nature based scientist from a long lineage of foresters, who engineered sophisticated tools based on his observations of the power of implosion. Robert touches on the subject of radiation and the nuclear scare scam that he says needs reexamining. We give some critical thought to the viability of free energy and what has been keeping this Earth preserving technology from replacing the current, colossally costly applications. Later, we examine the credibility of popularly upheld scientists like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, and we speculate as to why the bulk of modern scientific developments are keyed in on intensifying the death grip of control on humanity.

Title: Tito Perdue - The Ills of Equality & Extreme Democracy - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6x1JAiKG_G8
Description: Tito Perdue was born in 1938 in Chile and he returned to Alabama in 1941 with his family. Tito graduated from the University of Texas in 1961 and spent some time working in New York City, an experience which garnered him his life-long hatred of urban life. After holding positions at various university libraries, Tito has devoted himself full-time to writing since 1983. He has seven novels published to date, and Arktos has published his novel “Morning Crafts,” along with “William’s House,” both of which are part of a four volume series. 

In this dialogue, Tito begins with the story of his life and times in Alabama and the inspiration that led him to embark on a literary career. We talk about the ideologies that America was founded on, with focus on the concept of equality that was in response to what was considered oppressive aristocracy. Tito explains his views on the shift away from natural order resulting from the push for extreme democracy, and we look at the debasing of racial heritage that has degenerated the fundamental values of Western culture. We consider the universal experience of racism and the nature of the human psyche that has been repressed because of the stagnation created from obsession with excessive material wealth and the absence of true opposition and conflict. We discuss the history of cultures who have failed to rise up in resistance to invasions and we look at the undeniable dilapidation that is currently occurring in the West as the refugee incursion intensifies. Further, Tito talks about the advancement of Islam and the psychological warfare that keeps Whites from questioning the viability of multiculturalism. 

In the members’ hour, we look at the impending extinction of Western culture as we know it, and Tito speaks about the extraordinary movement of national socialism in the 1930s. We get into the ills of feminism and the realities of self-segregation between differing cultures, along with the destructive transformation of America that began with the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Tito emphasizes the downfalls of “diversified” civilizations and says that the globalist’s control of the media is to blame for promoting the war on Whites and the heinous policies designed to discriminate against the founding blood of the US. We also talk about propaganda-filled Hollywood movies that are destroying the true history and mythos of European culture and the anti-White emotional programming that is endorsed through academia and influential media, such as the New York Times. At the end, Tito leaves us with ideas for strengthening the New Right movement and sustaining a merchant class of our own, that will drive its successful realization.

Title: Mike Walker - The Return of Odysseus - Hour 1
Date: 2015-12-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=sAICGCtQtAU
Description: Mike Walker is an author and poet who is the former editor of the “The Scorpion,” a renowned British new right magazine. He has written three plays: “King,” “Hitler’s Temptation,” and the newly published, “The Return of Odysseus.” Walker’s verse has appeared in a variety of publications and he has spoken publicly on literary and political themes. 

Mike is with us to impart his motivations for writing “The Return of Odysseus,” an adaptation of Homer’s deeply symbolic, mythological tale of the long-lost King of Ithaca, Odysseus, and the return to his homeland. We discuss the ages-old theme of a king coming home and inspiring a civilization to ascend from a state of d
