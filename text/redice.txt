Title: Faith Goldy & Lauren Rose - Dear Cucks, Only One Kind of Nationalism Will Save the West
Date: 2017-12-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=EFPR5bd5ovo
Description: Faith Goldy is a Canadian journalist, who was formerly with Rebel Media. Lauren Rose is an American college student and YouTuber. 

After a few necessary introductions, we begin talking about how Faith and Lauren became nationalists. Faith cites her mother as an important influence, while Lauren explains that living around diversity led her to begin asking questions. Next, we discuss civic nationalism: what it is, and why it’s an issue. Lauren argues that civic nationalism is not real nationalism, for it ignores the realities of race and ethnicity. Later, we talk about the importance of identity, and why IQ shouldn’t be the only factor when considering immigration. The show also explores ethno-nationalism, which Faith argues is still a bit too radical for the masses.

This leads to a discussion on the notion that Right-wing men are a threat to women – something all of the women disagree with. Later, the ladies take turns explaining why they feel the Right offers women more than the Left. The show also covers the unfolding #MeToo scandals, in which many famous men – predominantly Left-wing – have been accused of sexual misconduct.

Title: The Participation of Police & Military in Multiculturalism - Impivaara
Date: 2017-12-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=O2fSPyPkYDY
Description: This time the discussion deals with the police and the military service and how they relate to multiculturalism and follow the common liberal trend, together with other governmental or non-governmental institutions.

The image of the police and the message they want to convey is more often questioned. The same goes for military service, as they too are adjusting their policies according to minorities. Both the police and the military forces have presented comments and behavior that does not contribute to Finnish citizens or the culture, on the contrary.

During the cultural collision it is profitable to seek the answers from cultural behavior and values. The Scandinavian mindset will provide some data for explaining the tolerant behavior of governmental and non-governmental institutions.

This is the second episode of Impivaara, a Finnish concept that Juhana L will explore in a series for Red Ice TV.

Title: Jay Dyer - How Cult Leader Charles Manson Was Made
Date: 2017-11-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kDGtAZbJ_Bc
Description: Jay Dyer is a public speaker, lecturer, comedian and author of Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film, as well as the host of the JaysAnalysis Podcast/Esoteric Hollywood. He is also a regular contributor to 21stCenturyWire, Soul of the East and the Espionage History Archive. Jay's work covers a wide variety of subjects, including metaphysics, film analysis, theology, geopolitics, literature, and history.

Jay returns to Red Ice for an in-depth discussion about Charles Manson. The program is a detailed contextual examination of one of the world’s most nefarious criminals. Jay and Henrik discuss the cult of personality surrounding Manson not as an isolated phenomenon, but as a product of cultic events in London, the American prison system, Scientology, psychological manipulation, drug use, and the military industrial complex. The conversation ranges from Manson’s own chaotic, dysfunctional upbringing to connections between Hollywood, esoteric cults, and calculated psychological experiments. Henrik and Jay speak to the powerful synergistic effect that these seemingly disparate phenomenon have when harnessed by an establishment bent on affecting social change. The conversation also addresses MK Ultra, Satanism, the ritualistic murder of Sharon Tate, Roman Polanski, Aleister Crowley, Elvis, Anton Szandor LaVey, Kenneth Anger, and much more.

Title: Jay Dyer - How the Elite Uses Sexual Abuse for Control in Hollywood, Politics and Media
Date: 2017-11-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=njYpqpaf2dI
Description: Jay Dyer is a public speaker, lecturer, comedian and author of Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film, as well as the host of the JaysAnalysis Podcast/Esoteric Hollywood. He is also a regular contributor to 21stCenturyWire, Soul of the East and the Espionage History Archive. Jay's work covers a wide variety of subjects, including metaphysics, film analysis, theology, geopolitics, literature, and history.

Jay returns to Red Ice to discuss sexual abuse in Hollywood, left-wing hypocrisy, smart cities, and much more. First, we talk about the recent developments in the Weinstein scandal. Jay tells us that we can’t be too surprised, for this type of deviancy has been a defining part of Hollywood for quite some time. We then discuss how the elite use sex to gain control over actors, politicians, and other people of influence. Later, we consider the way the Left has responded to the accusations that have been leveled against Kevin Spacey. The show also explores smart cities, artificial intelligence, and the future of human civilization.

Date: 2017-11-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=bbvIEEARUYk
Description: Ever since Trump won the election, the Left has been holding on to the idea that Trump conspired with Russia to “steal” the election. 

However, on Monday, the first charges in Mueller’s investigation were approved by a grand jury...and none of them were remotely damning for Trump.

Title: Saudis to Control World's First Artificial Intelligence in Future City Neom
Date: 2017-11-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=c8hXlEeqWzQ
Description: Henrik takes a closer look at Saudi Arabia's new Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Future Investment Initiative that was held in Riyadh recently. Announced was an ambitious project, the creation of a new futuristic mega metropolis driven by Robots and Artificial Intelligence.

Despite warnings, mankind will move forward to build AI but the question is who will control it? Are we ready to hand over control to those that simply can pay for it?

Saudi Arabia's push to "modernize" and move away from extremist Islam appears to be a front. The crown prince is most likely seeking these changes in Saudi Arabia for economic reasons, but also to look good in the eyes of Western liberal and Asian investors, entrepreneurs and creative minds that are eager to bring AI to life and build the future. 

The Saudis want to be at the forefront of Robotics and Biotechnology and with their massive Sovereign Wealth Fund they will be able to attain technology that will give them a massive advantage over many other countries. Should the Saudis and their allies be in control of the most powerful inventions that the world has ever seen? Many brilliant mind have warned that this new emerging technology is something that is MUCH worse than nuclear weapons.

Title: Rose McGowan Shifting Blame from Weinstein to Trump and Men
Date: 2017-10-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=X4lfApFYxCE
Description: Rose McGowan gave a radical feminist speech at the Women's Convention in Detroit this Friday. She went from blaming Weinstein and the environment in Hollywood for the alleged sexual abuse she experienced, to blaming Trump and males in general. She even went so far as to say "[Weinstein] and the big monster (Trump), they need to die." For women like Rose, the blame needs to be shifted from the industry that use and abuse young naive women - with depravities such as the “acting couch” - to holding ALL men responsible.

What's the solution? Listening to Rose and others behind the #MeToo campaign, a new era dominated by women and “minorities” will fix things. A new proletariat melded of the current victim classes will dominate over the patriarchy and the White males that built it. Power needs to be put into the hands of these angry vengeful women, that will end the cycle of abuse.

The Women's Convention in Detroit is a nutty left-wing gathering that is peddling to every perceived victimized group – not only women – in order to gain as much political leverage as possible. The objective is to fight Trump, not to end abuse of women in Hollywood or anywhere else.

Title: Kevin MacDonald - Weinstein's Hollywood, Clinton's Russia Scandal & Hypocritical Liberal Elites
Date: 2017-10-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NiTWh8paqNY
Description: Dr. Kevin MacDonald has a PhD in Biobehavioral Sciences and is an expert on Jewish influence and identity. He is the editor and chief contributor of The Occidental Observer, an online publication that focuses on White identity, White interests, and the culture of the West. Kevin is also the author of numerous books, including The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements.

Kevin returns to Red Ice amidst the Harvey Weinstein scandal to give us an academic perspective on Hollywood and the Jewish obsession with gentile women. We first talk about Weinstein, the producer currently embroiled in a sexual misconduct scandal. Kevin then explains the reasons why the perversions of Harvey Weinstein, Philip Roth, and others are archetypally Jewish.This leads to a discussion on how Hollywood, despite clearly being a den of iniquity, has nevertheless saw fit to lecture Americans on morality for decades. The show covers much more, including the Russian uranium deal, opioid crisis, and Trump administration.

Title: The Harvey Weinstein Scandal Is Why We Need to End the Patriarchy - Operation Reinhard
Date: 2017-10-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZFPLdhh5crg
Description: The Weinstein scandal has led many to wonder how rampant sexual abuse in Hollywood could be allowed to go on for so long. Some have theorized that this is because a certain ethno-religious cabal is running things, but I think that we all know this isn’t the case. 

Instead, the reality is that Hollywood is run by the patriarchy, and it is the patriarchy that is responsible for keeping a lid on this widespread sexual abuse.

Title: Roderick Kaine - Testosterone Rex: Award-Winning Feminist Propaganda
Date: 2017-10-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=DcUBTsENEa0
Description: Roderick Kaine holds a degree in biochemistry and has done professional research in both biology and neuroscience. He is also the author of Smart and SeXy, which explores the biological foundation of cognitive differences between the sexes.

Roderick returns to Red Ice to discuss Testosterone Rex. Written by feminist Cordelia Fine, the book is a biased attempt to dismiss biological differences between the sexes. As Roderick explains, Testosterone Rex is politics first, and science second. Nevertheless, Testosterone Rex won the (once) prestigious Royal Society prize for book science book of the year. We discuss the many ways in which Fine used bad research to attack a complete straw man, and ponder what her motivations might be. The show covers much more, including gender neutral schools, children as political pawns, and the main problems with the modern university system.

Title: Patrick Le Brun - The French Patriot Act: More Power for the Elite
Date: 2017-10-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=B642sjy9qKo
Description: Patrick Le Brun is a writer and activist who has written many articles for Counter-Currents. He has extensive experience with the French Identitarian movement. He is currently based in the United States, where he mentors college students who wish to engage in activism.

Patrick returns to Red Ice to discuss a recent national security bill passed by the French government. Similar to the Patriot Act in America, this bill greatly expands the powers of the French state to fight terrorism. The main issue, as Patrick explains, is that what constitutes terrorism remains ambiguous. Patrick argues that the French ruling elite see nationalism, not radical Islam, as a threat to their interests. Later, we talk about the Islamization of France, and how imams are radicalizing the country’s non-White prison population. The show covers much more, including Patrick’s thoughts on Charlottesville and the American Alt-Right.

Title: Weekend Warrior Ep45 - Infiltration Is The New Normal for Alt-Right & Antifa
Date: 2017-10-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=w4jRIgkiphs
Description: Weekend Warrior is a weekly live show that covers news, entertainment and culture from an Identitarian perspective.

The show opens on the Swede who went “undercover with the Alt-Right” claiming he captured “new and shocking” footage of the true Alt-right. On the flip side, Crowder's producer infiltrated and filmed a small antifa cell plotting violence. Meanwhile in Sweden, The Nordic Resistance Movement marched the streets of Gothenburg in protest of their traitorous politicians while clashing with the police. 

Lana comments on the Harper's Magazine cover story about her claiming that she supports a movement that is hostile to women and other leftist nonsense. Henrik comments on an Amy Goodman video about mass media claiming that communists and immigrants are the media's boogeyman, not Whites.

Also discussed is the Sudanese man in Tennessee who walked into a church and began shooting White people in revenge for Charleston and anti-White hysteria on American campuses. 

Later, Lana talks about an official study using synthetic oxytocin on Caucasian test subjects in order to make them love migrant invaders and in commie California, the Rocklin Academy School board rejected the ability for parents to opt their children out of transgender brainwashing courses.

Title: Blair Cottrell - Australian Nationalist Found Guilty of Opposing Islamization
Date: 2017-09-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=YZinLU6l4ok
Description: Blair Cottrell is an Australian political activist, carpenter, and the leader of The United Patriots Front.

Blair joins us to discuss his legal battles, the Islamization of Australia, antifa, and much more. But first, Blair tells us about his background, including how he came to be involved in right-wing politics. Next, we discuss the recent court decision in which Blair was found guilty of “inciting contempt for Muslims.” This leads to a consideration of Islam in Australia, which Blair tells us is growing at an alarming rate. The show explores many other topics, including Australian antifa and Blair’s thoughts on the American Alt-Right.

Description: Millennial Matt is a free speech activist, YouTuber, and political dissident with an interest in historical revisionism.

Matt joins us to discuss his videos, antifa violence, Charlottesville, and much more. To begin, Matt tells us about his background, including how he came to be red-pilled. Next, we talk about some of the videos he’s made. Matt explains his notorious trolling of Shia LaBeouf, which took place at the short-lived He Will Not Divide Us exhibit in New York. Later, Matt tells us about his experiences at Unite the Right in Charlottesville, which leads to a discussion on the Left’s proclivity for violence. The show concludes with a consideration of why White identity – something once accepted as healthy and reasonable – has become so profoundly vilified.

Title: Jazzhands McFeels - The End of DACA
Date: 2017-09-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=bZs10KZwv3k
Description: Jazzhands McFeels is the host of Fash the Nation, a popular Alt-Right podcast focused on American politics.

Jazzhands joins us to discuss the Trump administration’s recent decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, otherwise known as DACA. We begin by outlining the history of this controversial program, which Barack Obama instituted via an executive order. Jazzhands then explains how DACA works. Switching gears, we consider the approach Trump has taken to end the program. With a six-month window before DACA ends, we ponder the various ways in which things could play out. The show covers much more, including the BRIDGE act, illegal immigrant criminality, and whether or not it is appropriate to refer to DACA recipients as “dreamers.”

Title: Titus Flavius & Rudolf von Flügel - Aleksandr Dugin, Dinesh D’Souza & Death Positivity
Date: 2017-09-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=krUBeNQFq-E
Description: Titus Flavius and Rudolf von Flügel are contributors to the humorous Tales from the Trough podcast. Titus is also the host of KulturKampf, a podcast that focuses on philosophy and literature.

Titus and Rudolf join us to discuss a number comical stories from the past week. We first go over a recent HuffPost article on Aleksandr Dugin, which claimed that Putin is supporting Identity Evropa. Next, we switch gears from Dugin to another right-wing luminary: Dinesh D’Souza. We poke fun at Dinesh’s awful talking points, and refute the idea that fascism is a left-wing phenomenon. Later, we discuss a recent development in post-modern feminism: the death positive movement. This leads to a discussion on the upcoming, all-female Lord of the Flies remake, which promises to be about as interesting as watching paint dry. The show also explores the various ways in which progressive sentiments are ruining art.

Title: Kalki Weisthor - Initiation: The Art of Self-Transformation
Date: 2017-09-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=wUuttxNwB6Y
Description: Kalki Weisthor, otherwise known as Robert, is an Armanist, Wotanist, student of the Vedas, and former attorney.

Robert returns to Red Ice to discuss initiation: what it is, how it’s done, and what forms it comes in. We first outline the differences between right-hand path and left-hand spirituality, and then consider the usefulness of such a dichotomy. Next, we embark on an in-depth exploration of a number of different religious, occult, and spiritual traditions, including Buddhism, Christianity, and Satanism. Later, we discuss various initiatory practices, ranging from astral projection to meditation. Robert relates to us many of his personal experiences, and offers advice to those interested in exploring the farthest reaches of human consciousness. The show explores all of this and much more, including the relevance of certain metaphysical ideas to the ongoing struggle against globalism.

Title: Nick Fuentes - Attacked by the Conservative Establishment for Criticizing Israel
Date: 2017-08-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=bcGeA2hrqrs
Description: Nick Fuentes is a 19-year-old college student, political analyst, and former Right Side Broadcasting employee. He is also the host of the America First podcast.

Nick joins us to talk about the attacks he has suffered – largely at the hands of other right-wingers – for daring to voice controversial opinions. After hearing a little about his background, Nick explains how the Reagan Battalion, Ben Shapiro, and others have – unsuccessfully – tried to destroy him. This leads to a broad discussion on all that is wrong with the conservative movement, including its ahistorical understanding of America and peculiar aversion to “identity politics.” The show covers much more, including Marxist indoctrination in universities, the beliefs of the founding fathers, and the future of right-wing politics in America.

Title: Jared Taylor - AmRen Growing, Rape Gangs in Newcastle and Google Fires James Damore
Date: 2017-08-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3xWix-EK3T4
Description: Jared Taylor is an American journalist, editor of the American Renaissance webzine, and president of the New Century Foundation. His organizations are dedicated to the study of immigration and race relations. Mr. Taylor is the author of several books and scholarly papers, including Paved with Good Intentions, White Identity: Racial Consciousness in the 21st Century, and the forthcoming monograph entitled If We Do Nothing. 

The interview begins with Jared describing this year’s hugely successful American Renaissance (AmRen) conference. He speaks to the Great Awakening of White racial consciousness in the United States and around the world, which has contributed to the immense popularity of AmRen events. Henrik and Jared go on to discuss the increased presence of protesters at the conference, and how that coincided with Donald Trump’s electoral victory. The conversation moves on to the Unite the Right event scheduled for Saturday 12 August 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia. We discuss the threatened removal of the Robert E. Lee statue, the resultant bureaucratic machinations at the municipal level, and the symbolic nature of the gathering. Jared astutely points out that whilst our enemies may be threatening Southern Heritage at present, they will set upon all aspects of White identity before long. Jared also speaks to the universal veneration of Robert E. Lee: he was held in highest esteem on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line. We go on to discuss the potentiality for an expansion of the AmRen event calendar and the different options being considered. Jared goes on to describe that the work at AmRen falls into two categories: race realism and White advocacy. Henrik introduces the subject of Muslim grooming gangs, recent revelations in Newcastle, England, and ongoing revelations about similar events in Rotherham. The discussion turns to similar events in Sweden and Germany, the crisis of European masculinity, and the systematic nature of the Muslim rape Jihad. The first half of the program also features discussions about White racial consciousness and its ability to transcend politics, the rise of nationalist movements, and Jared’s upcoming book.

In the member’s hour Henrik and Jared discuss former Google employee James Damore’s memorandum, which addresses sex differences and so-called diversity initiatives at the giant tech company. Jared states that while Damore’s memo is not directly related to race, it is challenging the prevailing miasma of enforced egalitarianism that suggests sex differences, like race differences, are illusory. This astonishing act of self-hypnosis runs contrary to reality. The scholarly nature of the memo was impressive. Jared marvelled at the deceitfulness of how Damore’s positions were portrayed; this occurs when egalitarian orthodoxy is being punctured. Henrik then broaches the related subject of platform denial, shadow-banning, and censorship of right wing views. Jared agrees that this is a problem and there will be other tactics used against the Alt-Right: “All orthodoxies, as they die, lash out in desperation.” The program ends with a brief assessment of Trump’s performance as president of the United States to date.

Title: Kevin MacDonald - The Importance of Understanding the JQ
Date: 2017-08-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=HyRw2vAKxdI
Description: Dr. Kevin MacDonald has a PhD in Biobehavioral Sciences and is an expert on Jewish influence and identity. He is the editor and chief contributor of The Occidental Observer, an online publication that focuses on White identity, White interests, and the culture of the West. Kevin is also the author of numerous books, including The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements.

Kevin returns to Red Ice to discuss the many ways in which Jewish intellectuals have shaped Western history, culture, and politics. To begin, Kevin tells us about how he came to be an expert on this controversial topic. We then talk about the nature of group interests. Kevin explains that Jews, after arriving in America, correctly noticed that the country favored Whites. This sense of exclusion, he argues, is why Jewish intellectuals have sought to undermine White group solidarity. The first hour touches on many other subjects, including Jewish involvement in communism, mass immigration, and the civil rights movement.

In the members’ hour, we begin by considering divisions within the Western Jewish community. Kevin explains that while Jews might disagree on many issues, there is a large consensus when it comes to immigration, refugees, and the separation between church and state. This leads to a discussion on the abundance of Jewish think tanks, and the need for Whites to have organizations representing their interests. Later, Kevin offers advice for talking about Jewish influence without sounding like a complete lunatic. The members’ hour also covers the prevalence of state-funded, anti-White propaganda, and recent developments in the Trump administration.

Title: Jonas Nilsson - Anarcho-fascism: Nature Reborn
Date: 2017-07-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gWu-k25eCd4
Description: Jonas Nilsson is a political analyst, graduate student, and martial arts expert. He is the author of Anarcho-fascism: Nature Reborn, a book that endeavors to synthesize two seemingly contradictory ideologies.

Jonas joins us to discuss his work, tribalism, Sweden, and much more. First, we talk about his book, Anarcho-fascism, including what inspired him to write it. We then discuss the role tribalism plays in politics, and how the Left is unprepared to deal with ethnic conflict. Later, we consider the future of Sweden. Jonas reminds us that non-Swedes do not constitute a cohesive political unit, meaning native Swedes will retain political dominance for the foreseeable future. The first hour also covers demographics, attempts to integrate ISIS fighters, and the effect geography can have on political philosophy. 

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing violence. Jonas talks about his experience teaching martial arts, explaining that many Swedish men feel compelled to learn self-defense in these troubled times. Switching gears, we ponder how Sweden can be saved from its current predicament. Jonas argues that electing the Sweden Democrats would be a step in the right direction, but ultimately not enough. The members’ hour touches on much more, including the importance of masculinity, the notion of “privilege”, and a few relevant bits of Swedish history.

English version will be available at the end of August.

Description: Ingrid Carlqvist and Daniel / Conrad joins Henrik for a special Norse News to discuss the political fallout after one of the biggest data breaches in Swedish history. This was preventable but happened because of government negligence and failure to act and take responsibility on part of several ministers. It's becoming embarrassingly clear that Swedish politics is like kindergarten.

Title: Christoffer Dulny - From Sweden Democrat to Alt-Right: The Metapolitical Struggle
Date: 2017-07-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Um5PwiMIooc
Description: Christoffer Dulny is a political activist and the current editor-in-chief of Nordic.AltRight.com. Christoffer holds a bachelor’s degree in law and was formerly the budget chief for the Sweden Democrats.

Christoffer joins us for an interesting discussion on Swedish politics, the Alt-Right, and much more. First, Christoffer tells us about his background, including his time with the Sweden Democrats and how he came to be involved with the Alt-Right. We then discuss Nordic.AltRight.com, and how a culturally competent Right has caught the Left off guard. Later, Christoffer explains why he supports using globalism against globalism. The first hour concludes with a discussion on the importance of retaining a positive outlook on things.

In the members’ hour, we begin by considering the biggest data leak in Swedish history – a recent event that was entirely avoidable. Next, we mull over the mindset of the average Swedish politician. Christoffer explains that the Swedish government, by not holding politicians liable for their failures, only encourages them to worry about losing reelection. This leads to a broad discussion on the overall state of Swedish politics. The members’ hour covers much more, including the economic burden of multiculturalism, racial differences, and the demographic transformation currently taking place in this once-idyllic nation.

Title: Defend Europa: The Abhorrent Transformation of Britain
Date: 2017-07-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XgIozIeBMJ8
Description: William is a historian and minor political activist. He writes for Defend Europa and has a passion for European politics and the future of our continent in the face of existential crisis. Laura is a nationalist from Yorkshire in England and a writer for Defend Europa. Laura's main interests are population replacement and Islam.

Laura and William join us for a discussion about their website, Defend Europa. In the first hour, we discuss the site’s founding and its recent relaunch. Defend Europa is a website that provides uncensored news coverage of the migrant crisis, Islam, population replacement, heritage, identity, and the establishment elite. The site’s mission is to bring uncensored news to anyone that holds Europe in their heart. In addition to covering these subjects, Laura and William explain that the site is also devoted to the preservation of European culture. The site’s contributors explore the beauty of Europe, history, art, architecture, and philosophy as well. The discussion turns to the lack of honest news coverage in the United Kingdom and how Defend Europa fills a void in an era of increased internet censorship. We discuss the transformation of Britain over the last 30 years, the need to contribute to the information war, generational tensions, and the cultural schisms within British society. 

In the member’s hour the conversation turns to the proliferation of Sharia courts in the UK and the parallel nature of Muslim communities within the country. Laura states that according to outdated 2011 statistics, there are 3 million Muslims in the country that have established no-go zones in Luton, Birmingham, and Bradford which conceal Sharia courts that operate out of shops and mosques. The discussion shifts to the rate of female genital mutilation (FGM), rape, and forced marriage in the Muslim community. William makes the point that police are hamstrung in their efforts to curb these practises in Muslim areas as the spectre of widespread reactive rioting and violence is very real. We then turn our attention to the nature of radicalization, terrorism and the politics of identity in Muslim communities. We also cover the dangers associated with becoming a minority in a formally White-majority country, amidst a culture of White guilt, by using South Africa as an example. The wide-ranging conversation also covers the hypocrisy of the mainstream press, the JQ, Whites in Zimbabwe, and the Manchester bombing.

Title: Hans Lysglimt Johansen - The Alliance: Nationalism and Free Speech in Norway
Date: 2017-07-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=hb4uSGxOJUA
Description: Hans Lysglimt Johansen is a Norwegian entrepreneur and free speech activist, founder of the new Norwegian political party Alliansen (The Alliance). Johansen has a history of work within the libertarian, classical liberal movement. He believes in reviving national identity, national culture as well as pagan spirituality in order to fight back against destructive globalism.

Hans joins us to discuss his political work, current events, and many other important topics. First, Hans tells us about The Alliance. We learn that, while his party is united in its support for free speech, candidates are free to run on their own platforms. Switching gears, we talk about the situation in Europe. Hans argues that the encroachment of Islam – enabled by mass immigration – poses a threat to Europe. Later, we turn our attention to Norway, exploring its demographics, political landscape, and nationalist movement. 

In the members' hour, we begin with an interesting discussion on the benefits of a more interconnected Europe. Hans outlines his vision for the future of Europe, explaining that its current immigration project is inhibiting true social progress. With regard to solving Europe's demographic crisis, Hans recommends removing the incentives – social as welfare and employment prospects – that lure immigrants to Europe. The members' hour explores many other topics, including structural explanations for globalism, political change, and the relevance of ancient European culture to our contemporary struggle.

Title: Elisabeth - European Cooking and Philosophy
Date: 2017-07-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=D_f5_wao3-g
Description: Elisabeth is a YouTuber based in the Netherlands. Her videos delve into traditional European recipes, philosophy, spirituality, and culture. 

The show begins with Elisabeth telling us about her YouTube channel, European Kitchen. It began as a cooking channel that has increasingly featured videos about philosophy. Lana and Elisabeth discuss favorite dishes, the importance of a healthy diet, and its link to our ancestral past. The discussion turns to the nutritional dichotomy present in the United States, which is characterized by organic foods on the one hand and fast food on the other. Elisabeth speaks about her more recent videos and her desire to condense philosophical concepts into pithy forms for her viewership. We then speak to the European woman’s unique ability to nurture, to protect, and to inquire. Elisabeth goes on to talk about the feminine nature of philosophical inquiry and the complimentary and reciprocal relationship between men and women. Later, the discussion turns to staving off nihilism through positivity, paganism, achieving spiritual actualization through integrity, and femininity in the Alt-Right.

Description: Christopher Cantwell is the host of the Radical Agenda, a live, open phones, uncensored right-wing talk show tackling issues and current events from an alt-right libertarian perspective.

Chris joins us once again for lively show covering a number of important topics. After catching up, we dive into more serious matters. We discuss the ongoing political polarization taking place in America, with Chris reminding us that the Left is waging war, while many on the Right are under the naive impression that civil discourse will solve things. Later, we discuss political violence, libertarianism, and mass immigration. The first hour concludes with Chris offering his thoughts on the Alt-Lite.

In the members' hour, Chris begins by telling us about his trip to the recent Bilderberg conference. This leads to a discussion on Jewish influence, which, as Chris reminds us, is a very suppressed issue. Switching gears, we then talk about Europe's demographic plight. Chris predicts a backlash among immigrant populations if and when the welfare stops flowing. The members' hour explores much more, including the 2016 election, mainstream media, and the importance of self-improvement.

Christopher returns to offer a controversial perspective on geopolitics, Vladimir Putin, and other related subjects. We begin by discussing Putin, including his background as a KGB agent. Christopher then argues that Putin is sponsoring false flag terrorism in order to make himself out to be a glorious leader. Later, we discuss the possibility of Trump being a Russian agent. The first hour covers much more, and concludes with a discussion on the Alt-Right’s relationship with the Russian president.

In the members’ hour, we first talk about the KGB, and then switch gears to consider Chabad-Lubavitch. This leads to a discussion on Putin’s relationship with the Jewish community both in Russia and abroad. Next, we discuss Zionism and Communism. Christopher then argues that the West should ally with Islamic countries against the forces of Zionism. The members’ hour explores many other topics, including Jared Kushner, China, and the need for a unified resistance movement.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=eE_9y3wbRtU
Description: Jim Horn is a retired US Diplomat, author, and counter-jiadhi activist. He is the author of Experiencing Islam: Becoming Islam-Aware, Moslem Men Fear Women, and Islam in the Workplace: Moslems in the Workplace.

Jim joins us to discuss Islam, Sharia Law, globalism, and many other relevant topics. First, Jim tells us about his background. We learn about his first-hand experience with jihadis while working as a US diplomat. Next, we discuss the threat political Islam poses to the West. Jim cites the existence of “no-go” zones as evidence that multiculturalism isn’t working in Europe. The first hour also covers Jim’s letter to Sweden, the legal nature of the Quran, and the threat Sharia law poses to America. 

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the history of Islamic conquest and debunking the idea of the Islamic Golden Age. Switching gears, we consider whether or not mass multiculturalism could lead to serious civil unrest. Jim then takes the opportunity to warn us about the effects of an increasingly diverse police force. Later, we dive deeper into Islamic history, exploring Muhammad’s life, motivations, and much more. The show concludes with a discussion on the various types of Islam, including the Salafism favored by the Islamic State.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=RhsLvo7a_kE
Description: Melissa Mészáros is an English teacher and YouTuber. Although she was born in America, Melissa eventually returned to her ancestral homeland, Hungary, where she now lives.

Melissa returns to Radio 3Fourteen to catch up and talk about recent events. We begin by discussing Fidesz, the political party currently in power in Hungary. Melissa explains that Fidesz, thanks to its hardline stance on the migrant invasion, was originally quite popular; their approval rating now, however, has fallen. We then talk about the Left in Hungary, and consider the effect Western media is having on Hungarian culture. This show covers much more, including multiculturalism in America, the Alt-Right, and Trump’s presidency so far.

Title: Jason Kessler - Right-Wing Activism: The Alt-Lite Disavows Free Speech Rally
Date: 2017-06-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=44YZ3iV0qXQ
Description: Jason Kessler is a journalist, activist, and author from Charlottesville, Virginia. His reporting has been covered by numerous media outlets, including The Daily Caller, VDare, and The Washington Post.

Jason joins us for a show on many important issues, including right-wing activism, free speech, and the ongoing struggle against Cultural Marxism. We first talk about Jason’s hometown, Charlottesville, which has been embroiled in controversy as of late regarding its Confederate statues. We discuss about antifa, and Jason gives us the rundown on their strategies, goals, and overall mentality. Later, we consider the upcoming free speech rally in D.C., which various Alt-Lite figures abandoned after it was announced that Alt-Right figures would be speaking. The first hour dives deeper into the Alt-Lite’s motivations, and concludes with a discussion on White genocide. 

In the members’ hour, Jason tells us about Charlottesville’s Vice-Mayor, Wes Bellamy. We learn about Bellamy’s anti-White Twitter rants, which Jason helped expose. This leads to a discussion on Charlottesville’s handling of its Confederate monuments. Jason explains that his hometown’s liberal city council has made no attempt to be diplomatic. We then switch gears to consider the big picture. Jason compares our situation to that of South Africa, as both involve the removal of statues and demonization of White historical figures. The members’ hour also explores the future of America, Balkanization, and the demographic displacement of indigenous Europeans.

Stell offers advice for girls interested in living a more traditional life, including not swearing and avoiding promiscuity. This leads to a discussion on traditionalism: what it is, and why it’s important. Later, we talk about the question of women in politics, and conclude with a discussion on Stell’s plans for the future.

Title: Pax Dickinson - Counter.Fund: Alt-Right Crowdfunding, Leftist Censorship and Forced Diversity
Date: 2017-06-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=fIM96Da85xM
Description: Pax is an experienced technologist with 20 years industry experience. He is the co-founder of WeSearchr, former CTO of Business Insider, and chairman of Counter.Fund.

Pax joins us for a discussion on digital platform censorship, free speech, current events, and much more. We first talk about Pax’s professional background, including his firing from Business Insider. Next, we discuss his new project, Counter.Fund. Pax gives us the rundown, explaining why Counter.Fund was created, and how it differs from other crowdfunding platforms. We then consider censorship and the ongoing political polarization taking place in America. The first hour also covers the Alt-Lite’s recent interruption of Shakespeare in the Park – a stunt that has been met with ambivalent reactions.

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to discuss Pax’s upbringing and ideological journey. Pax tells us that he was raised by hippie parents, who told him to question authority. While Pax was originally a libertarian, he, like many others, drifted from libertarianism after discovering the work of neoreactionary theorist Mencius Moldbug. We then learn why Pax considers himself a Redneck Zionist, and not a White Nationalist. Later, we discuss diversity, multiculturalism, and equality. Pax reminds us that these Leftist values essentially amount to religious convictions. The members’ hour explores many other topics, including Trump’s presidency thus far, technology, and Pax’s plans for the future.

Now, it would be easy to write off this shooting as being nothing more than an isolated incident, perpetrated by a lone maniac. The truth, however, is that this part of a much larger trend of Leftist political violence.

Title: Lennart Svensson - Science Fiction Seen from the Right
Date: 2017-06-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_W3iwyEhKBo
Description: Lennart Svensson is a Swedish author. Although he began writing exclusively in Swedish, Lennart now writes in English as well. He is the author of numerous books and essays, including Science Fiction Seen from the Right, Redeeming Lucifer, and Borderline: A Traditionalist Outlook for Modern Man.

Lennart joins us to discuss right-wing themes in science fiction. We first consider the fact that contemporary science fiction often comes from a left-wing perspective. Lennart explains that his work, therefore, seeks to remedy this situation. We then explore right-wing themes in a few popular works of science fiction and fantasy, including Starship Troopers, Dune, The Lord of the Rings, and The Hideous Strength. The first hour also touches on relationship between technology and science, with Lennart advocating a spiritualized view of technology as a means to resist lapsing into materialistic nihilism.

In the members’ hour, we continue our examination of science fiction and fantasy as seen from the right. We discuss Kallocain, a book which has many parallels with George Orwell’s 1984. Lennart then argues that Aldous Huxley’s A Brave New World is much more applicable to our situation today, as 1984 is more reminiscent of 20th century totalitarianism. This leads to a discussion on how the control of language is being used to limit the ability of the masses to express politically incorrect views. Later, we discuss a number of other authors, including Ernst Junger and Arthur C. Clarke. The members’ hour also explores some highly esoteric topics relating to science fiction: human origins, extraterrestrial races, and more.

Title: Squatting Slav - The End of SJWs
Date: 2017-06-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=8RIVW19QQo4
Description: Squatting Slav is a Serbian-Canadian YouTuber. His videos employ humor to expose the Left’s insanity, hypocrisy, and overall ridiculousness. 

Squatting Slav joins us to discuss his videos, Serbian history, European politics, and much more. To begin, Squatting Slav tells us about what prompted him to start a YouTube channel. We then consider Serbia, and the strong connection Squatting Slav feels with his ancestral homeland. This leads to a discussion on Serbian history – in particular, how Serbia’s involvement in various wars in the 90s affects its outlook on contemporary politics. Switching gears, we talk about the migrant crisis, Islamic terrorism, and Eastern Europe’s refusal to accept mass immigration from the third world. The first hour concludes with a discussion on Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, and how his ideas have influenced Europe’s ruling elite. 

In the members’ hour, we begin by considering China. Squatting Slav explains how immigrants who come to the West are oftentimes primarily concerned with their own ethnic interests. We then discuss the similarities between Canada and Sweden. Both, we agree, have kicked the progressive agenda into overdrive, and are thus more socialist than liberal. Later, we talk about the anti-SJW movement in Canada. Squatting Slav points out that there is now a massive anti-SJW movement, not only in Canada, but in the West overall. As such, the influence of SJWs appears to be waning. Our show covers much more, and concludes with a discussion on the future of Serbia.

Title: Tara McCarthy - UK Election in the Wake of Three Terrorist Attacks
Date: 2017-06-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2F6YTfPc608
Description: Tara is a British YouTuber, host of the Reality Calls podcast, and co-host of Virtue of the West. 

Tara returns to Red Ice to discuss the 2017 UK general election, current events, and the many problems plaguing Britain. We begin by talking about the election. Tara tells us about the various parties and politicians, and explains why UKIP has been floundering since Brexit. We then consider Islamic terrorism – a timely topic, considering the recent London Bridge attack. Tara explains that Theresa May’s response has been to propose internet censorship, effectively stripping the rights from innocent citizens rather than dealing with the elephant in the room: Muslim immigration. This leads to a discussion on nationalism, including the various ways in which it is superior to multiculturalism. Our show concludes with a discussion on the Alt-Right, trolling, and the need for less bickering within the movement.

Title: Operation Reinhard - The Religious Question: Toward a New Mythos
Date: 2017-06-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7kII8KldFas
Description: Every great civilization requires a uniting mythos – a narrative that serves as its ideological foundation and provides a meaningful narrative for its past, present, and future. A quick glance at the Alt-Right reveals that we have Christians of various denominations, Pagans, atheists, and agnostics. As such, we are need of a new mythos – one that transcends our differences and unites us.

Title: James Bowery and Kevin MacDonald - The Moral Individual vs Acting As One
Date: 2017-06-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7sJTHq7Lg4A
Description: This show is guest hosted by James Bowery. James is an American IT pioneer who descends from Scotch-Irish ancestry, with the patriline geographically concentrated in Groningen, Netherlands. He is the architect of Sorotocracy.org

Dr. Kevin MacDonald has a Ph.D. in Biobehavioral Sciences and is an expert on Jewish influence and identity. He is also the editor and chief contributor of The Occidental Observer, an online publication that focuses on White identity, White interests, and the culture of the West.

Kevin MacDonald and James Bowery discuss the dilemma of individualism in white identity. The white predisposition toward respect of the individual and fairness guarantee defeat if extended into war. White identitarians, recognizing the war being waged against whites, are denouncing individualism for this reason. Among the most dedicated adversaries of white identity are many whites who wield weapons of moral rhetoric forged in the Jewish intellectual movements MacDonald describes in "The Culture of Critique". Proclaiming the "individual" as preeminent these intellectual movements simultaneously, proclaim the interests of "protected groups" exempt from individualism. Bowery argues this moral rhetoric is, in effect, an ethno-specific biological weapon targeting an essential racial character of whites: A sense of fairness toward individuals. MacDonald focuses on indoctrination of such moral rhetoric as decisive but concurs there may very well be a heritable component that is characteristic of whites. Bowery poses the riddle of white military superiority throughout much of history as contrasted against white impotence against these ethno-specific bio-weapons of moral rhetoric.

Title: Mark Collett - The London Bridge Terror Attack Was Preventable
Date: 2017-06-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=A3UuArC18Ro
Description: Mark Collett is a British political activist and the author of The Fall of Western Man. He has been politically active since his late teens and was formerly the Youth Leader and Head of Publicity for the British National Party. In 2004 he was arrested for several speeches he made and in 2006 was tried and found not guilty on all counts. Mark now works with numerous groups both in the UK and abroad and produces his own weekly podcast.

Mark returns to Red Ice in the wake of the London Bridge terror attack to discuss recent events, Islamic terrorism, and multiculturalism. We begin by talking about the recent attack in London. Mark reminds us that London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, previously stated that terrorist attacks are part and parcel of living in a big city. This leads to a discussion on the failure of multiculturalism in Britain. Mark tells us that British Muslims are overwhelmingly on welfare, live in insular communities, and have very little in common with native Brits. The first hour explores many other topics, including the establishment’s response to such acts of terrorism, the firing of Breitbart writer Katie McHugh, and what a future without Europeans would look like. 

In the members’ hour, we pick up where we left off in our discussion on Britain’s current plight. We discuss the mainstream media’s response to Islamic terrorism. Mark points out that the media never addresses the underlying causes of these attacks: multiculturalism, the migrant invasion, and radical Islam, to name a few. We then discuss the recent accusations that CNN staged a Muslim protest after the London Bridge attack. Switching gears, Mark outlines many of the views held by British Muslims – views that antithetical to not only traditional British culture, but liberalism as well. The members’ hour also covers voting patterns among immigrants, individualism, and solutions to the West’s crisis.

Title: Roundtable - June 6th: The National Day of Sweden
Date: 2017-06-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1KLLGmcaQCY
Description: A panel of Swedish patriots join Henrik for a roundtable discussion on the National Day of Sweden, June 6th, and what it means to most Swedes today. On the panel: Ingrid Carlqvist, Daniel Frändelöv AKA Conrad, Stefan Jacobsson, Marcus Follin AKA The Golden One, and Christoffer Dulny.

Our show begins with Ingrid arguing National Day, unlike Midsummer, isn’t a particularly important day for most Swedes. We then discuss how National Day is used by progressives to welcome foreigners into Sweden. Marcus reminds us that all people of European heritage are facing a similar threat, and thus share the same destiny. Switching gears, we discuss the cyclical nature of civilization, and how times of great struggle often lead to rebirth. Later, we consider the importance of metapolitics, with Marcus stressing the need for more Alt-Right art and music. Our show also explores the demonization of Swedish men, healthy gender relations, and much more.

Title: James Allsup - College Republican Against Globalism & Cultural Marxism
Date: 2017-06-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=GTt5RSSYF_M
Description: James Allsup is a YouTube partner, writer, and former political operative. He runs a YouTube political commentary channel with over 100k subscribers, writes for The Liberty Conservative, and was the Senior Adviser for the Students for Trump organization in the 2016 election cycle. He is a senior at Washington State University and former chairman of the Washington College Republicans Federation.

James joins us for a lively discussion on globalism, Trump, the Alt-Right, and much more. We first discuss James’ background, including how he came to be involved in politics. This leads to a discussion on the current state of American universities. James fills us in on the recent insanity at Evergreen State, where White students and professors have been terrorized for refusing to submit to the demands of social justice warriors. Switching gears, we discuss the pitfalls of democracy, the reality of identity politics, and the red-pilling effect Leftist academia is having on students. The first hour concludes with a discussion on Donald Trump, the Alt-Lite, and how criticizing blue-haired feminists will only take us so far. 

In the members’ hour, we give some consideration to the theories regarding the murder of Seth Rich. We examine some of the evidence, which James finds to be cause for suspicion. We then discuss diversity. James notes that the logical conclusion of diversity is simply fewer Whites – not a multicultural utopia. Later, we discuss globalism, and the elite’s efforts to destroy true diversity through the mass mixing of cultures. James then argues that this, combined with anti-White propaganda, is convincing non-Whites to blame everything on White people. The members’ hour explores a number of other topics, including the future of Rebel Media.

Title: Gilad Atzmon - Being in Time: Jerusalem & Athens
Date: 2017-06-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=yDBir720kAY
Description: Gilad Atzmon is an Israeli born jazz musician and author that lives and works in England. He is trained in composition and jazz at the Rubin Academy of Music, Jerusalem. He is a member of the Blockheads, founded the Orient House Ensemble in London, and has recorded and performed with many rock music legends. Gilad also writes on political matters, social issues, Jewish identity and culture. Atzmon is the author of The Wandering Who, A to Zion – The Definitive Israeli Lexicon, and Being in Time: A Post-Political Manifesto. 

Gilad returns to Red Ice to discuss his new book, Being in Time, political censorship, Marxism, and much more. To begin, Gilad tells us about a recent incident in which antifa, unhappy with his outspoken views, attacked him. Gilad uses this story to draw attention to the fact that the West is currently divided between those who believe in civil debate, and those who do not. We discuss how the elite caters to the later, silencing views in opposition to the globalist agenda. Later, we discuss Trump, the Left’s curious relationship with the working class, and the role identity plays in politics. 

In the members’ hour, we discuss how the Left discarded its support for free speech. We then talk about Karl Marx. Gilad argues that Marx was, all things considered, an intellectual open to debate and philosophical inquiry; his followers, as Gilad explains, then took his ideas and turned them into dogma. Switching gears, we discuss Gilad’s recent book, Being in Time. Gilad outlines some of its main ideas, and describes how it relates to The Bell Curve – a book which has been thoroughly suppressed and attacked by egalitarian academics. This leads to a discussion on the ruling elite: who they are, how they came to power, and to what extent Jews play a role. Our show covers much more, and concludes with a discussion of the Manchester bombing.

We then ponder whether there is any reality behind such symbolism. The show concludes with Jay telling us what to expect from future episodes of the new Twin Peaks.

Date: 2017-05-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=JXgh003V54s
Description: Gorgo is an Australian YouTuber. Her videos explore themes such as nationalism, identity, and traditionalism.

To begin, Gorgo tells us about how she arrived at the Alt-Right. We learn about how she came to discard feminism, and the positive effects this had on her life. Gorgo explains that feminism instilled in her a sense of victimhood, which led to depression. This leads to a discussion on the importance of tradition. We then discuss egalitarianism. Gorgo makes a case for embracing differences and inequality, as they are fundamental aspects of reality. Later, Gorgo shares her thoughts on the Alt-Right, explaining that she appreciates the movement’s emphasis on positive values. Our show covers much more, including Gorgo’s thoughts on the Alt-Right, demographics, and multiculturalism.

Title: Andy Nowicki - Meta-Pizzagate: The Investigation Continues
Date: 2017-05-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=eBohFaQQ3RI
Description: Andy Nowicki is the assistant editor of Alternative Right and author of many books, including Meta-#Pizzagate, The Columbine Pilgrim, and Notes Before Death.

Andy returns to Red Ice to discuss his recent book, Meta-#Pizzagate, and a number of related topics. We begin by discussing the mainstream media treatment of Pizzagate. Andy explains that the media has been incredibly disingenuous, claiming that Pizzagate has been “debunked” without even considering the evidence. This leads of a broad discussion on Pizzagate, covering James Alefantis, John Podesta, and the DNC. The first hour delves into the motivations of our ruling elite, and why, by embracing an inverted morality, they are not like us.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on Pizzagate. Henrik poses the question: has Pizzagate fizzled out? Andy assures us that this is not the case; many researchers are continuing to investigate the elite’s involvement in sex trafficking – despite facing substantial censorship. We then switch gears to discuss Donald Trump’s presidency thus far. Andy tells us that he has always been a bit apprehensive about Trump, and reminds us that a lot happens behind the scenes that we will likely never know about. The members’ hour concludes with a consideration of how to deal with Pizzagate in the future.

Title: Operation Reinhard - Against Equality
Date: 2017-05-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=STZ0Ar0b-iA
Description: Equality is somewhat of a sacred value for the Left. To even suggest that all individuals or groups might not be equal is tantamount to heresy within the progressive paradigm. Given that the drive for equality constitutes a major part of the Left’s destructive agenda, this concept is certainly worthy of consideration.

Title: Alt-Right Defends Southern Heritage in Charlottesville, VA
Date: 2017-05-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=f9xHhbG3wvk
Description: On May 13th, around two-hundred Alt-Right supporters gathered in Charlottseville, VA. To protest the removal of the Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson statues. Later that night, they marched with fire lit torches to the Robert E. Lee statue. They held a flame lit vigil to pay respect to Southern heritage and ancestors. Mainstream Media reported that this was virtually a KKK rally. The mainstream media are nothing but liars. Our culture, heritage & history are being attacked and removed. Defending it is not hate, it is love for what is exclusively ours. We will continue to defend it. We will not back down!

Title: Jim Goad - SJWs: The New Church Ladies
Date: 2017-05-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1lE955SuTNE
Description: Jim Goad is an American writer and publisher. He is the author of The Redneck Manifesto and The New Church Ladies. Jim also co-authored and published the magazine ANSWER ME!.

Jim returns to Red Ice to discuss his new book, current events, and the ongoing insanity of the Left. First, Jim tells us about The New Church Ladies. We discuss the puritanical nature of social justice warriors, including their obsession with microaggressions. Jim argues that such a mindset is the result of material excess, as people struggling to feed themselves would have more important things to worry about. Later, we ponder what motivates the Left, and Jim offers some advice for interacting with these new church ladies. The first hour also touches on anti-Whiteness, multiculturalism, and how becoming a father altered Jim’s perspective for the better. 

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to discuss President Trump. Jim relates his frustration with Trump’s decision to bomb Syria. We then mull over the hurdles Trump has faced since taking office, including his battle to instate a temporary travel ban. We then discuss the cult of guilt that has taken over the West. Later, we consider why White identity – once commonplace – has been so vilified in recent years; this, Jim argues, is mostly because White solidarity poses an obstacle to globalism. The members’ hour covers much more, including what can be done to oppose Cultural Marxism and save the West.

Title: Igor & Darya - What Do Russians Think About the Liberal World Order and Russophobia in the West?
Date: 2017-05-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=FuiTjREOQe0
Description: Igor Starkov is a photographer, journalist, and art-curator. Darya Andreeva is a journalist affiliated with multiple news outlets, including Russia Today. 

After some necessary introductions, we dive into the main topic of our show: Russia. First, Igor and Darya tell us what they think about the Russian hysteria sweeping the West. Next, we discuss Russia’s political system, which is, contrary to what some might think, neither Communist nor fascist. Igor and Darya explain that Russia is quite conservative, and that the average Russian would be considered far-right in America. Our show covers many other topics, including Russian identity, multiculturalism, and how Russia views the Alt-Right.

Title: Nick Land - The Dark Enlightenment: Neoreaction & Modernity
Date: 2017-05-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oAT14h5_lMo
Description: Nick Land is an English philosopher, writer, and pioneer of the theory fiction genre. He is also known for being a primary theorist of the Neoreactionary movement.

Nick joins us for a fascinating discussion on Neoreaction, progressivism, and the future of Western civilization. We begin by discussing Nick’s background. Initially a libertarian, Nick eventually stumbled upon the work of Mencius Moldbug. This leads to a consideration of the central ideas of Neoreaction. We discuss neocameralism, an approach to governance that incorporates free market forces. Nick then describes the cathedral, which refers to the alliance of institutions – NGOs, corporations, academia, etc. – responsible for promoting progressivism. Later, Nick draws an apt comparison between the invention of the printing press and the rise of the Internet. The first hour touches on much more, including universalism, modernity, and multiculturalism.

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to consider potential solutions to the West’s decline. Nick argues that we must dismantle the managerial state, explaining that the Right shouldn’t count on being able to control it indefinitely. We then discuss Islam and European politics. Nick explains how Europe’s ongoing demographic transformation is poised to drastically alter the European political landscape. Later, we talk about the need for an ideological divorce, as Western nations have become far too divided to function properly. Nick argues that such a divorce would allow for competition between different political factions, revealing which lead to success and which do not. The show concludes with a consideration of whether or not the Left will realize its mistakes before it’s too late.

Title: David Dees - Trump in Bed with the Globalist New World Order
Date: 2017-05-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=c7PTmUzB4-k
Description: David Dees began his career as a commercial artist in the early 80s and has produced advertising illustration for Paramount Studios, Hanna Barbera, and Disney Home Video, along with cartooning and children’s book illustration for Sesame Street magazine, Family Home Entertainment, and TIME Magazine for Kids. In 2003, when Dees became fully awake to the New World Order Zionist agenda, he began fighting back with his own brand of activist political artwork and social commentary, with nearly 600 hard hitting and comical art pieces. David also designs and illustrates covers for authors of health, political, fiction and non-fiction books.

David returns to Red Ice for a discussion on his work, current events, and the overall state of the world. We first discuss Trump's presidency, and consider the possibility that he was a puppet for the elite all along. This leads to a discussion on Israel and foreign policy, with David reminding us that Trump campaigned as an anti-war candidate, but proceeded to bomb Syria after taking office. We discuss North Korea, and consider whether this Asian country has been unfairly maligned by our establishment media. The first hour also touches on David’s work, censorship, and Sweden.

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to discuss other pertinent issues. We ponder the future police robots, which David argues will be used by the elite against the masses. We discuss virtual reality, sex robots, and how technology is being used to cater to man’s base desires. This leads to a discussion on health and nutrition. David makes a case for vegetarianism, citing ethical and health concerns. Henrik, however, remains unconvinced, and argues for a paleo diet. The members’ hour concludes with a discussion modern society’s obsession with transgenderism.

Title: Ryan Landry - Political Street Violence in Weimerica
Date: 2017-05-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vNVK3IHuIEA
Description: Ryan Landry is a Midwestern family man born and raised in New England. When not working in the financial realm, he maintains the blog 28Sherman and writes every Sunday at Social Matter. His podcast, Weimerica Weekly, is hosted by Social Matter as well.

Ryan returns to Red Ice to discuss the growing similarities between America and the Weimar Republic. We begin by reviewing how the American political landscape has changed since 2016. Ryan draws attention to the escalating street violence between political factions, and reminds us that this was a defining aspect of Weimar-era Germany. We then touch on other similarities between Weimar and Weimerica, including sexual deviancy. Ryan explains that Weimar-era perversion was mostly hidden; in Weimerica, however, people are shamed if they do not accept degeneracy. The first hour concludes with a discussion on multiculturalism, identity, and demographics.

In the members’ hour, we return to our discussion on Weimerica. We touch on the economic factors that led to mass unrest in the Weimar Republic, and give consideration to the possibility of an economic collapse in America. This leads to a discussion on the infamous brownshirts: who they were, what they did, and what their motivations were. Later, we consider the ongoing removal of Confederate statues. Ryan draws a comparison to ISIS, which has been known to destroy the monuments of its conquered subjects. The members’ hour also explores equality, World War I, Macron’s recent victory, and much more.

Title: Operation Reinhard - How the Alt-Right Should Relate to The Alt-Lite
Date: 2017-05-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=S-mHfeBGTiI
Description: Thanks to its highly controversial nature, the Alt-Right tends to see itself as a lone force against the world. When you’re the only ones speaking unpopular truths, it can become easy to assume everyone else is ignorant or insincere. 

However, this isn’t an entirely accurate picture of the situation. 

As the recent street victories against the Left have demonstrated, the Alt-Right can’t do this alone. This doesn’t mean that we should water down our message, but we should do our best to remain friendly with the greater Trump movement.

Title: Nathan Damigo - What Really Happened at the Third Battle of Berkeley
Date: 2017-05-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=raNK5BP3G84
Description: Nathan Damigo is a combat veteran, university student, and activist. He is also the founder of Identity Evropa, a North American Identitarian organization dedicated to creating a new future for people of European heritage.

Nathan returns to Red Ice to give us an exclusive breakdown of the events that transpired at the Third Battle of Berkeley. To begin, Nathan explains why Berkeley is a significant location for these clashes to be taking place. Nathan argues that the Left’s premises are founded upon falsity; as such, those on the Left feel compelled to respond violently to any information that disproves their narrative. Later, we get around to discussing Nathan’s encounter with Moldylocks. Nathan describes the event in detail, and provides some necessary context, which proves that his actions were undoubtedly justified. The first hour concludes with a discussion on the Alt-Right and Identity Evropa.

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to discuss a few other noteworthy happenings at the Third Battle of Berkeley. Nathan offers an eye-witness account of the Roman-saluting, skateboard-toting Trump supporter who was wrongly accused of being an anti-fascist infiltrator. This leads to a discussion on the Oath Keepers, an organization which professes support for free speech, but has made threats of violence against Identitarians. We then talk about antifa, and the role optics plays in activism. The members’ hour also covers the psychological profile of your average anti-fascist, the Haitian Revolution, the Alt-Right as a legitimate counter-culture, and much more.

Title: PhilosophiCat - How To Talk to Normies & Agitators Posing As Alt-Right Men
Date: 2017-05-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MIwg9marj5Y
Description: PhilosophiCat is a nationalist YouTuber who loves politics, philosophy, and cats.

PhilosophiCat joins us for an insightful conversation on nationalism, multiculturalism, and the survival of the West. We first learn about her upbringing, including how she came to be a race realist. Next, we ponder why many White people are seemingly indifferent to the survival of their group. This leads to a discussion on White guilt. PhilosophiCat argues that there is something about ethnic Europeans that makes them uniquely prone to guilt – a trait that has been weaponized against us. The show also covers differences between Right-wing and Left-wing political movements, degeneracy in mass media, and the experience of women in the Alt-Right.

Title: Operation Reinhard - The Problem with Individualism
Date: 2017-05-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ru-7geG67eo
Description: The Alt-Right is quite often accused of collectivism by libertarians and conservatives. While there is a degree of truth to this, the fact of the matter is that groups will always out-compete lone individuals. And, contrary to what self-proclaimed individualists claim, free thinking can go hand-in-hand with ethnic consciousness. In fact, the classical liberal ideals championed by contemporary individualists were created by ethnonationalists.

Title: Ingrid Carlqvist - Scandal in Sweden When Ingrid Questions the Unquestionable
Date: 2017-05-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=rHvfBtwspPM
Description: Ingrid Carlqvist worked in mainstream media for many years, before starting Dispatch International with Lars Hedegaard in 2012. She has been a writer for Gatestone Institute and co-hosts the popular Swedish podcast, Ingrid & Conrad.

Ingrid returns to Red Ice to discuss her experience as a journalist telling unpopular truths in Sweden. To begin, she tells us about how she set out to understand why Sweden had become multicultural. Ingrid quickly realized that it is nearly impossible to discuss Jewish influence, as most people – even those critical of Islam – are unwilling to venture into such controversial waters. We then discuss Barbara Spectre, an influential American Jew in Sweden who has called for the end of European civilization through mass immigration from the third world. Later, we discuss Holocaust revisionism, and how Ingrid’s willingness to question – not deny – this historical event has affected her journalism career.

Title: Hagen Grell - Germany’s Multicultural Disaster
Date: 2017-04-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=borD8pq1NSg
Description: Hagen Grell works as a host in the German alternative media, as a reporter, entrepreneur and trouble maker for the good cause. As a web programmer by trade he's now fighting the social programming of political correctness. His main fields are journalism, philosophy, psychology and interviewing guests.

Hagen joins us for a lively discussion on the current state of affairs in Germany. To begin, Hagen explains how he came to be involved in nationalist politics and alternative media. Next, we switch gears to discuss Germany. Grell tells about the absurdity of German hate speech laws, and how most major political parties agree on all of the core issues. We then consider Alternative for Germany, a center-right political party that is, contrary to the claims made by the establishment, actually quite moderate. The first hour also covers immigration, demographics, and ethnic loyalty.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on Germany. Hagen tells us about the public response to Germany’s multicultural problems. We learn that many Germans are worried about their country, but are afraid to voice their opinions due to fear of social repercussions. This leads to a discussion on the effects of having politically incorrect views in the West, and how many people refuse to even consider right-wing ideas. Later, we discuss Islamic terrorism in Europe. The members’ hour also covers much more, including tribalism, religion, and the importance of self-improvement.

Title: Nicole - How the Migrant Invasion Made Me Become a Trad Wife
Date: 2017-04-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XFARztGNJDo
Description: Nicole is a mother, classically trained singer, and practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Nicole joins us for a lively talk about her life, ideological journey, and the overall state of the world. To begin, she tells us about her background. Nicole was raised in rural South Dakota, and later moved to Boston to attend Berklee College of Music. She describes the initial culture shock, and how she was sucked into the liberal hivemind. We then learn about her experiences living and working in Germany. Nicole witnessed firsthand Germany’s ongoing demographic transition – a transition that led to her feeling unsafe in this formerly idyllic European nation. Our show covers many more topics, including Nicole’s work on Indian reservations and refugees being relocated to North Dakota.

Title: Ricardo Duchesne - Radical Liberal Norms That Lead to the Decline of the West
Date: 2017-04-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kusx1_wRsyQ
Description: Ricardo Duchesne, Professor at The University of New Brunswick, Canada, is the author of The Uniqueness of Western Civilization (2011), and Faustian Man in a Multicultural Age, released in March 2017 by Arktos Books. He is one of the co-editors and principal writer of the blog Council of European Canadians. He just completed a manuscript with the tentative title "Mass Immigration, Diversity, and the Destruction of Canada". He is the only academic in Canada, and possibly the Western world, who rejects totally the diversification of Western nations in favour of European Ethnic Identity.

Ricardo returns to Red Ice for an engrossing conversation on multiculturalism, history, and liberalism. We begin by discussing Ricardo’s academic career, which has been slightly complicated by his opposition to the reigning Leftist status quo. Ricardo explains that some academics vocally oppose feminism, but it’s rare to find one speaking out against multiculturalism. Next, Ricardo outlines four post-WWII norms that have contributed to the ongoing decline of Western civilization. The first hour concludes with an explanation as to why Canada is not, contrary to what many believe, a nation of immigrants.

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to discuss the Alt-Right and Western history. Ricardo critiques some common perspectives on liberalism found in the Alt-Right, arguing that we should be careful not to condemn the West overall when discussing the causes of its current crisis. Ricardo then reminds us that most classical liberal values originally had an ethnic component. Switching gears, we discuss rationalism, liberalism, universalism. Later, we ruminate on Asian immigration into Canada, which Ricardo cites as a threat. Our show concludes with a discussion on Trump’s presidency thus far, and what we can expect to see from him in the future.

Title: Acharya - Dharma, Natural Law: A Remedy to the Spiritual Crisis in the West?
Date: 2017-04-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=CojRdFOQ-tg
Description: Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya is a renowned spiritual teacher, vedic scholar, and religious leader. In addition to being a spiritual master, Sri Acharyaji holds a Ph.D. in Languages and Cultures of Asia at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a focus on Religious Studies and Philosophy of Religion. He is also the author of The Dharma Manifesto: A New Vision for Global Transformation. 

Acharya joins us for an enlightening conversation on the intersection between spirituality and politics. After a hearing about Acharya’s ideological journey, we discuss his book, The Dharma Manifesto, which uses ancient wisdom to solve modern problems. We then discuss dharma, which Acharya defines as natural law. We learn that this concept has equivalents in many other religions, including Buddhism and Taoism. Switching gears, we discussing the present state of academia. Acharya argues that students in modern universities, while possessing an honest desire to understand the world, unfortunately wind up being indoctrinated into believing that dharma – the natural order of the cosmos – is wrong. The first hour concludes with a fascinating discussion on Abrahamic religion, including its history and different branches. 

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the West’s current crisis. We discuss the new word order, otherwise known as globalism, which is threatening the existence of Western civilization as we know it. Acharya makes a case for Marxism being the fourth branch of Abrahamism, due to its utopian aspirations and binary approach to other ideologies. We then discuss the situation in Europe, including its low birth rate. Acharya points out that, if the ruling elite truly valued the existence of the European people, it would instate social programs that would lead to higher fertility rates. The members’ hour also covers a number of other topics, such as the refugee crisis, leadership, and the Kali Yuga.

Title: Anne Marie Waters - Sharia Watch: Opposing the Islamization of Europe
Date: 2017-04-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8dUyizfQw
Description: Anne Marie Waters is an English political activist and director of Sharia Watch UK. A former UKIP candidate, she later launched Pegida UK in conjunction with activist Tommy Robinson and politician Paul Weston.

Anne joins us for a show on Sharia Law, Islam, and jihadism. To begin, Anne tells us about Sharia Watch. We learn that she created the organization after looking deeper into Islamic scripture – an exercise most European politicians shy away from. Next, we consider whether or not Islam is, in fact, a religion of peace. Anne cites the conditions in Islamic theocracies as evidence that this claim is nonsense. We then ponder how people of European heritage would fare if the West were to become majority Muslim. Our show covers many more topics, including Sharia courts, terrorism, multiculturalism, and Leftist propaganda.

Title: Elora, Bre & Rebecca - Femininity in the Modern World
Date: 2017-04-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=pi_IOBiKDu8
Description: Elora is also known as The Blonde Buttermaker. She is a mother of 2, homemaker, blogger, and YouTuber. She promotes vibrant living by reconnecting to our roots with traditional foods. 

Bre Faucheux is an author and YouTuber. When she's not writing or making videos for the Alt Right you can find her working out or playing with new Cajun recipes. 

Rebecca is also known as Blonde in the Belly of the Beast. She's a conservative millennial dame living in the liberal hellscape of Seattle & speaking out against globalism, feminism, Islam & government corruption. 

Elora, Bre, and Rebecca joins us for an insightful and informative show on femininity, homemaking, and marriage in the modern world. We begin by discussing how romance has suffered under a stifling status quo. Next, we discuss dating, and the importance of being straightforward with a prospective partner. We then talk about motherhood. The ladies agree that the medical community is rife with fearmongering – especially when it comes to giving birth past a certain age. Later, we talk about true femininity, the dynamics of a traditional marriage, divorce, and much more. Our show concludes with a consideration on how men can effectively red-pill their wives or girlfriends.

Title: Operation Reinhard - Kushner Rising
Date: 2017-04-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6U-tqBsTZFg
Description: Within the Trump administration there are two factions vying for power: the nationalists, led by Steven Bannon, and the more establishment friendly centrists, led by Jared Kushner. 

By all appearances, Kushner has a strong Jewish identity. 

Now, given that the neoconservatives – whose agenda can be summarized as “invade the world, invite the world” – are virtually all Jewish, pro-Israel, and interested in destabilizing the Middle East, we should be deeply concerned with Kushner’s ascension.

Title: Kevin MacDonald - Neocons to Remove Assad, Trump Buys the MSM Lie
Date: 2017-04-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=s5e14irOPbg
Description: Dr. Kevin MacDonald has a Ph.D. in Biobehavioral Sciences and is an expert on Jewish influence and identity. He is also the editor and chief contributor of The Occidental Observer, an online publication that focuses on White identity, White interests, and the culture of the West.

Kevin returns to Red Ice for a discussion on geopolitics, current affairs, and the current trajectory of Donald Trump’s presidency. We begin by discussing the recent events in Syria. Kevin tells us that he felt betrayed by Trump’s statements regarding the alleged gas attacking. Next, we take a look at the moral arguments used by the establishment to justify regime change. Kevin reminds us that these are merely justifications for an international agenda that is anything but humanitarian. We discuss the accusations that Assad ordered the use of chemical weapons, and ponder why he would do so – knowing it would anger the West – when he was already winning. The first hour covers much more, including infighting in the Trump administration and the use of photography in propaganda.

In the members’ hour, we first discuss the refugee crisis. Kevin explains that it would be more sensible to relocate them to the Middle East; but the Left, intent on demographically transforming the West, is insistent on bringing them here. Next, we consider the ongoing investigation into Russia’s alleged hacking of the 2016 election. Kevin then outlines why he considers claims of collusion between Trump and Russia to be absurd. Switching gears, we discuss the wiretapping scandal involving Susan Rice, and how Trump’s presidency has been paralyzed thanks to an entrenched bureaucracy fighting him at every turn. The members’ hour also explores the lead up to the Iraq War, Neil Gorsuch, Leftist authoritarianism, and the future of the Alt-Right.

Title: Jennifer Lokken & Ayla - Tips on Raising a Large Family
Date: 2017-04-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=cRybvzf0WR4
Description: Jennifer Lokken, The Rational Redhead on Twitter, is a married stay at home mom of six kids who are all homeschooled.

Ayla is a former leftist turned conservative, stay-at-home, homeschooling mother of six children. She is passionate about European culture and history, and strives to be a traditional lady. She earned a Bachelor's degree in German with a minor in Anthropology.

Ayla and Jennifer join us to talk about traditional parenting, motherhood, and homemaking. To begin, they each offer some advice for young women interested in starting a family. Both agree that starting young is a good idea, so long as both parents have decent health insurance. This leads to a discussion on the financial side of parenting. Ayla advises against spending money on frivolities and instead investing in the family’s future. Later, we discuss a number of other topics, including homeschooling, cleaning, family health, and much more. Our show concludes with both Ayla and Jennifer reminding prospective mothers that children are a blessing, not a burden.

Title: Simon Roche - Suidlanders: Preparing for Disaster in South Africa
Date: 2017-04-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=woOQ6cmxKIY
Description: Simon Roche is Head of the Office of the HQ of the world’s largest non-state civil defence organization, Suidlanders of South Africa. Once an ANC activist, he now works tirelessly to prepare for impending catastrophe in the Rainbow Nation. Simon lives in Johannesburg and is the proud father of many children. 

We begin by discussing Simon’s current speaking tour. We learn that he’s traveling throughout America in order to raise awareness about the sore state of affairs in South Africa. Next, Simon tells us about life in post-apartheid South Africa. He explains that, in the 22 years since South Africa become Democratic, there has been a massive explosion in crime – in particular, violence against White farmers. Later, we discuss the nature of White genocide in South Africa, what Suidlanders is doing to prepare for the worst, and why many White South Africans remain oblivious to their plight. 

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on South Africa and consider what this impending catastrophe would look like. Simon explains that the worst case scenario is the one he most expects, for he believes the government will be involved in the unrest, siding against the Afrikaners. Switching gears, we discuss the economic situation in South Africa. We learn about the various government programs that give preference to blacks, which has many Afrikaners forced to live in squatter camps. Simon then outlines the strategies employed by elites to usher in Communism in formerly healthy societies. The members’ hour concludes with a discussion on the failure of multiculturalism in the Rainbow Nation.

Title: Fabian Fj䬬ing - Fighting Back Against the Lying Swedish Press
Date: 2017-03-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=HAE5rHVNxWw
Description: Fabian Fjälling, also known as Erik Johansson from Granskning Sverige (Review Sweden), joins us for a discussion about his recent visitation by Expressen, one of the largest evening newspapers in Sweden. Fabian has been known to call up journalists, politicians, and other people in the Swedish establishment to ask whether or not the Swedes exist as a people. Fabian was recently doxed, and he'll share with us just why the media establishment in Sweden considers him a thought criminal.

We begin by discussing Fabian’s work. He tells us that he became interested in journalism after becoming disillusioned with the mainstream media in Sweden. Fabian tells us about one particular instance in which the Swedish media referred to a number of non-White criminals as native Swedes. We then discuss Fabian’s discovery of traditional Catholicism, and how religion factors into his views on society. Switching gears, we discuss how the aftermath of World War II led to the demonization of ethnonationalism by conflating it with mass murder. The first hour also covers fake news, ethnic loyalty, and the media attacks Fabian has endured.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing Swedish laws that affect journalism in this troubled Nordic country. Next, we discuss the Russophobia sweeping the West, and ponder why the ruling elite is pushing for mass multiculturalism. Fabian argues that the elite wants to mix different cultures and races together because it makes the masses far less connected to the past, and thus easier to brainwash and control. Later, we consider how political correctness in Sweden has created rifts within families. The members’ hour covers a number of other topics, and concludes with a discussion on feminism.

Title: A Nazi in the White House? #GorkaMustGo, Why the Media Hates Gorka
Date: 2017-03-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=P0sUTM-LyAE
Description: Henrik breaks down what's behind the vilification of Sebastian Gorka, the Deputy Assistant to President Trump.

The hashtag #GorkaMustGo was trending just a few days ago and was pushed by the media in an effort to try to oust a man who is cutthroat when dealing with the media. Gorka, in fact when appearing on BBC called them fake news. The liberal and the media don't like Gorka and they want him out. Now they are trying to prove that a medal from the Order of Vit麬 is proof that Gorka is a Nazi. This is nonsense.

Title: Adam & Mary - Pro-White Christianity & How Church Has Become Anti-White
Date: 2017-03-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZnZ9tqDUPHc
Description: Adam and Mary are the hosts of Good Morning White America, a podcast that tackles lifestyle issues and news events from a pro-White, Christian perspective.

After a few introductions, Adam and Mary take turns telling us about their ideological journeys, including how they came to reconcile their pro-White views with Christianity. We then discuss how many contemporary Christians use certain Biblical teachings to justify open borders and mass multiculturalism – policies that would have been unthinkable throughout most of Christian history. Switching gears, we discuss the relationship between Judaism and Christianity, and how many Christians still view Jews as God’s chosen people. Our show also covers parenting, interreligious conflict in the Alt-Right, building community for pro-White Christians, and much more.

Title: Matthias Waggener - Wolves of Vinland: A Tribe Against the Modern World
Date: 2017-03-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Y0xMQJ4sK-Y
Description: Matthias Waggener is one of the founding members of the Wolves of Vinland, and has served as the president of both the Ulfheim and Windborn chapter, which he founded, over his 12 years as a member. He is an accomplished artist and one of the few hexologists currently practicing in North America.

Matthias joins us for a very interesting conversation on modernity, tribalism, and self-transformation. We begin by discussing Matthias’ journey, which eventually led to the founding of the Wolves of Vinland. Matthias explains that a close relationship with his brother, Paul, helped him to understand the value of tribe from a young age. We then switch gears to discuss the current state of the world. Matthias argues that the modern world perverts our natural desires – such as those for food, shelter, and so forth – by telling us that we need excessive material comforts to be not only happy, but accepted within society. The first hour touches on much more, including civil unrest, personal sacrifice, and how our current crisis is making our people stronger.

In the members’ hour, we delve into a discussion on Matthias’ more esoteric interests. Matthias outlines the basics of hexology, including its history, application, and why this archaic practice works. We then discuss how intent trumps symbolism during magical operations. Later, Matthias offers some sagely advice on the subject of personal initiation. Drawing from his own experiences with meditation, astral projection, and lucid dreaming, Matthias reminds us that the inner world is vast, awe-inspiring, and, unfortunately, quite often overlooked in the modern world. Our show concludes with a discussion on the importance of carving a path that allows one to feel truly alive.

Title: Sam Dickson - 100th Year Anniversary of America's Entry into WWI
Date: 2017-03-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=dkLD0E3-CZ0
Description: Sam Dickson is a Southern historian and a prominent Atlanta attorney who offers legal counsel to White activists in America. He attended the University of Georgia in the late '60s and was active in the conservative organizations Young Republicans and Young Americans for Freedom. He graduated from University of Georgia Law School in 1972 and opened his law offices in Atlanta. Dickson is a member of the Council of Conservative Citizens and has given frequent lectures at American Renaissance.

Sam returns to Red Ice for a fascinating conversation on the history of the World Wars. First, we discuss Europe before the outbreak of World War I. Sam argues that this period was one of the best in all of European history for various reasons. We then discuss World War I, and ponder if it could have been avoided. Next, we discuss the Black Hand and the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. Sam explains that, while the latter was certainly the spark that set things in motion, there was already quite a bit of tension in Europe that led to the outbreak of World War I. Later, we talk about the Balfour Declaration, sinking of the Lusitania, and hypocrisy in America’s geopolitical agenda. The first hour concludes with a discussion on Sam’s plans for the future.

In the members’ hour, we continue our conversation on the World Wars. We discuss the American casualties in both wars, which were relatively low compared to those of other major countries involved. Switching gears, we discuss the hostile attitudes towards Germany during the interwar period. Sam explains that Britain, which had previously been the undisputed power in Europe, felt threatened by Germany’s economic success. We then consider the tragic nature of brother wars – that is, wars between fellow Europeans. Later, Sam describes the wave of anti-patriotic and anti-traditionalist sentiment that swept post-war Europe, and how this led to our current crisis. Our show concludes with a reminder from Sam regarding the insincerity and hypocrisy of our adversaries.

Description: One of the Hoteps, Hotep Jesus, join Henrik for a conversation about potential overlapping interests between the Hoteps and the Alt-Right. Do we share some similar ideas? More importantly, do we have a common enemy, trying to keep us at each other's throats?

Title: Anke Van dermeersch - Women Against the Islamization of Europe
Date: 2017-03-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oY9WNhJgy5I
Description: Anke Van dermeersch is vice president of the Belgian Senate and president of the organization “Women Against Islamization.” A member of Vlaams Belang, in the 1990s she was Miss Belgium and runner-up for Miss Universe. She is a lawyer and author of the bestselling book Neither Whore Nor Slave–Women Against Islam.

To begin, we discuss Anke’s background, including her transition from modeling to law, which eventually led to a career in politics. We then talk about the Flemish people, and Anke outlines the history of Belgium. Next, we discuss how mass immigration in recent years hasn’t resulted in a melting pot, but rather an increasing number of ethnic enclaves whose inhabitants are hostile to native Belgians. Switching gears, we discuss the ongoing Islamization of Belgium – in particular, how this process has affected women. Anke then tells us about the burka ban which she proposed as a member of Flemish parliament. Later, we talk about fertility rates in Europe, Vlaams Belang, and Anke’s book, Neither Whore Nor Slave–Women Against Islam.

Title: Roderick Kaine - Smart and SeXy: Biological Differences Between Men and Women
Date: 2017-03-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=g5nIam-kOoM
Description: Roderick Kaine is an American who has a degree in biochemistry, and he has done professional research in both Biology and Neuroscience. After moving on from this work, he has focused on writing and independent scholarship. Around 2010, Roderick began his work on his book, Smart and SeXy, which describes the biologically based cognitive differences between the sexes by using the latest research in neuroscience and genetics. Smart and SeXy was published in 2016. He has been active in the neoreactionary movement since 2014, where he writes under the name Atavisionary.

Roderick joins us for an eye-opening conversation on the biological differences between men and women. After a lighthearted rumination on International Women’s Day, we dive into the main topic of the show. Roderick explains that most scientists are aware of racial and sexual differences, but choose to keep quiet for the sake of their careers. Next, we discuss anthropologist Melvin Konner’s assertion that maleness is a defect – an absurd claim, to be sure, which Roderick easily refutes. We then discuss the discrimination hypothesis. Roderick argues that it is biological differences, not discrimination, that results in different outcomes for men and women. The first hour covers much more, including male-female differences in intelligence, transgenderism, and homosexuality.

In the members’ hour, we shift gears to consider the big picture. We consider how Western civilization lost its patriarchal vigor, as globalism and Leftism appear to be guiding us towards a more matriarchal culture. Roderick argues that the root of the problem lies in academia, which has become a Leftist echo chamber. We then ponder why men allowed feminism and the dissolution of traditional gender roles in the first place. While on the subject of gender roles, Roderick argues that both men and women must be forgiving to in order to return to more harmonious, traditional gender relations. Later, we discuss how fertility rates differ by political orientation, and what implications this holds for the future. The members’ hour also explores masculinity, legal factors in sexual relations, and the possibility of a peaceful solution to the West’s current crisis.

Title: Dutch Election 2017 - Live Coverage
Date: 2017-03-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0WoDps89xEs
Description: Red Ice TV is covering the Dutch Election live with Erkenbrand & Millennial Woes. We report on election results throughout the evening and do interviews with Erkenbrand attendees as votes are counted.

Don't miss it, the future of the Netherlands and possibly even the future of the European Union is at stake.

We're starting at 20:00 Central European Time (GMT+1) / 3 pm EST / Noon PST / 10 am (Thursday) Australian EST

Title: Erkenbrand - The Dutch Election: Who Will Determine the Future of the Netherlands?
Date: 2017-03-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=8S5ql-DH6qs
Description: Michael and Bas are Dutch Alt-Right activists who are part of the Erkenbrand group in Holland. They hosted their first conference in September last year and will be providing commentary for the upcoming Red Ice live coverage of the Dutch elections.

Bas and Michael join us for an insightful discussion on the state of Nationalism in the Netherlands. After a few necessary introductions, we dive into the upcoming Dutch elections. We discuss how having dozens of political parties leads to some interesting dynamics in Dutch politics. Bas and Michael tell us that they aren’t terribly enthusiastic about the prospects of the upcoming election, as none of the parties are particularly appealing. Switching gears, we discuss Denk, a pro-immigrant party in the Netherlands, and consider the chances of a party representing the interests of foreigners entering parliament. Later, we discuss multiculturalism, White guilt, and how Holland’s colonial history is used for political purposes against the Dutch.

Title: Ryan Faulk - In Defense of First World Policies & Genetics
Date: 2017-03-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=nY5QjAjgemM
Description: Ryan Faulk is co-founder of The Alternative Hypothesis, where he writes about a variety of subjects, including race realism, nationalism, history, and social science.

To begin, Ryan tells us about his background, how he came to be red-pilled, and why he decided to create The Alternative Hypothesis. With introductions out of the way, we then dive into the main topic of our show: First Worldism. Ryan then explains the meaning of this term, and what prompted its creation. He explains that referring to our enemies as the “Left” didn’t seem right to him for a number of reasons. As such, he concluded that Leftists are better understood as Third Worldists, since they support Third World policies and genetics. According to Ryan, this would then make us First Worldists, since we wish to retain the policies and genetics of the First World.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on First Worldism. We discuss the difference between religion and ethnoreligion; the difference between the two, Ryan argues, is often quite small. For example, while anyone can be a Sunni, this branch of Islam, in the real world, is inextricably linked with Arabs. Ryan argues that this doesn’t just apply to conventional religions, but to political ideologies as well. We discuss identity politics – in particular, how they’re never going away. Ryan points out that, in the absence of a racial/ethnic identity, people will form new identities around their favorite sports team, video game, smart phone, etc. The members’ hour also explores a number of other topics, including high-trust societies, race realism, and why most people have trouble accepting unpopular truths.

Title: Hunter Wallace - The Uncertain Future of the Alt-Lite
Date: 2017-03-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=WHL1nRKdkpw
Description: Hunter Wallace runs Occidental Dissent, where he writes about nationalist politics, current events, and culture. Hunter is also the news editor at AltRight.com. Reinhard Wolff hosted this show, as Henrik was out of town, traveling to the Identitarian Ideas conference in Stockholm.

Hunter joins us for a lively discussion on a number of salient issues: Milo’s recent fall from grace, the Alt-Lite’s future, Trump’s comments on Sweden, and much more. After learning about Hunter’s background, we dive right into the Milo controversy. Hunter tells us that he predicted Milo would crash and burn and thus isn’t terribly surprised about any of this. We then consider and summarily dismiss allegations about the deep state “taking out” Milo. Later, we discuss the Alt-Lite overall, and ponder why it is so adverse to so-called identity politics. The first hour also covers Donald Trump’s comments on Sweden, which were validated a few days later as immigrant riots broke out in Stockholm.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on President Trump. We discuss the ousting of Michael Flynn – an event that revealed the deep state intends to do everything it can to thwart Trump’s agenda. We then consider whether or not this marks the beginning of the end of American democracy, and whether or not Trump will become Caesar. Switching gears, we discuss what Trump must do to ensure he wins reelection. This leads to a discussion on the Democratic Party, which is currently leaderless and in shambles. The members’ hour concludes with a discussion on the future of the Alt-Right and includes some practical advice for how we can strengthen our movement.

Title: Ron Asher - In the Jaws of the Dragon: How China Is Taking Over New Zealand
Date: 2017-03-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=R4BLCu9xvRA
Description: Ron Asher is a New Zealand writer and commentator on current affairs. He lived in Hong Kong when it was a British colony and has become increasingly concerned at the way that China, through its state owned companies, is gaining enormous economic leverage over the New Zealand economy, aided and abetted by treacherous politicians who are well rewarded by the Communist regime after they retire from politics. Ron is the author of In the Jaws of the Dragon: How China Is Taking Over New Zealand.

Ron joins us for a conversation on China that is both fascinating and unsettling. To begin, Ron tells us about his book, In the Jaws of the Dragon. We learn that China has been systematically buying up land in New Zealand. Ron tells us about Confucius Institutes, which are used by the Chinese government for espionage and propaganda. We discuss how China, despite being Communist in name, is not Marxist in any meaningful sense. This leads to a discussion on the current state of China, which, as Ron explains, is corrupt, polluted, and has no rule of law. The first hour also touches on the recent increase in Chinese militarism, the difference between mainland Chinese and those in Hong Kong, and the NZ-China Free Trade Agreement.

In the members’ hour, we resume our discussion on China and New Zealand. Ron outlines how Chinese involvement in the New Zealand rail system has had disastrous results. We discuss Chinese tourism in New Zealand, with Ron explaining that Chinese tourists stick to Chinese-owned restaurants, tours companies, and other businesses, ensuring that their money remains in Chinese hands. Switching gears, we discuss how Chinese colonization is perfectly fine from a free market perspective, and why regulation is thus needed to ensure that New Zealand remains autonomous. The members’ hour also covers much more, including China’s abhorrent labor practices, and what we can learn from the British colonization of Fiji.

Title: Jay Dyer - Behind Flynn’s Removal: The Deep State War Against Trump, Russia & Sovereign Nations
Date: 2017-02-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=VGdXdbxGTlc
Description: Jay Dyer is a public speaker, lecturer, comedian and author of Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film, as well as the host of the JaysAnalysis Podcast/Esoteric Hollywood. He is also a regular contributor to 21stCenturyWire, Soul of the East and the Espionage History Archive. Jay's work covers a wide variety of subjects, including metaphysics, film analysis, theology, geopolitics, literature, and history.

Jay returns to Red Ice once again for a very timely conversation on current events, globalism, the deep state, and more. We begin by discussing the recent political assassination of Michael Flynn. Jay explains that there is an internal conflict within the deep state; one faction supports globalism, whereas the other supports nationalism. This leads to a closer look at what the deep state really is, and how Trump threatens this shadowy power structure. Later, we discuss fascism, which has been used as a bogeyman to scare people from tradition, natural order and hierarchy. Our show concludes with a few thoughts on the future of the Alt-Right.

Title: Rachel Summers - Liberals Are Modern Day Witch Hunters
Date: 2017-02-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=WsR15PcPkCs
Description: Known as the Dropout Philosopher, Rachel Summers walked away from the Ivory Tower, spent a year in a motorcycle mechanics program, and started research for her first novel, CondAmnation, in a local Harley Davidson shop. Rachel holds degrees in History, Comparative Religions, English Literature, and Philosophy. She is currently writing her fourth novel as well as articles for The Revolutionary Conservative.

Rachel joins us for lively conversation on philosophy, social issues, and esotericism. We begin by discussing Rachel’s background, including her experience in academia. This leads to a discussion on Rachel’s ideological journey, and the thinkers that have had the most influence on her. We then discuss some of the defining themes in her books, including what Rachel refers to as “antinomian mysteriosophy”; this, according to Rachel, is a process whereby socially accepted morality is flipped on its head in order to reach a new level of understanding. This show also explores many other topics, including feminism, the left hand path, modern day witch hunts, and how the totalitarian Left can be defeated.

Title: Isac Boman - Money Power: Globalism & Economics
Date: 2017-02-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=KGGOjgvfTj4
Description: Ålandic economist Isac Boman is the author of Money Power: A Force for Freedom or Slavery?. Boman’s original book on monetary theory is based on his Master’s thesis at Åbo Akademi University in 2015, which he wrote while working as a back-office manager at the Bank of Åland. Currently, he is mainly seen as a columnist for Nya Dagbladet – one of the more prominent non-establishment media platforms in Sweden.

Isac joins us for a highly interesting show on economics, banking, and cryptocurrencies. After learning about Isac’s ideological journey, we discuss his book, Money Power. Isac tells us about some of the absurd reactions to his book; by daring to take an objective, scholarly look at the economic policies of National Socialist Germany, he was compared to Hitler. This leads to a discussion on said policies, including what we can learn from them. Later, we discuss the Orwellian state of censorship in Sweden. We talk about Expo, an “anti-racist” organization partially funded funded by George Soros, and how the Leftist media works tirelessly to oppose the interests of ethnic Swedens. The first hour also delves into banking, the fractional reserve system, and money as a form of economic energy.

In the members’ hour, we resume our discussion on banking. We talk about the Bank of International Settlements, which is an international financial institution that holds immense sway over the central banks of many countries. Switching gears, we discuss the odd merger between Leftist ideology and international capitalism which defines globalism. We talk about how multinational corporations, despite being largely concerned with profit, espouse the same social justice talking points you would expect to hear from a Leftist activist. Later, we discuss the mass media brainwashing that has pathologized nationalism, which is nothing more than the desire to preserve one’s own people and culture. The show concludes with a consideration of what different cryptocurrencies have to offer.

Title: Paul Kersey - When Implicit Whiteness Becomes Explicit
Date: 2017-02-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gvRW_0D-if4
Description: Paul Kersey is the author of the blog Stuff Black People Don't Like, and has published many books on race, multiculturalism, and society, including The Truth About Selma, SBPDL Year One, Escape From Detroit, and Whitey on the Moon: Race and the Death of NASA.

Paul Kersey returns to Red Ice for a riveting conversation on current events, race relations, Donald Trump, and much more. We begin by discussing Black History month. Paul talks about Hidden Figures, a recent film that seems to suggest that a small group of black women were responsible for the success of the American space program. Switching over to current events, we discuss Trump’s 90-day travel ban, which has been erroneously referred to as a “Muslim ban”. Paul points out that the ban has been met with a great deal of support, despite being mislabeled by the lying press. Later, we talk about the growing divide in America, and how Rhodesia, South Africa, and Haiti serve as examples of what will happen if we lose. The first hour also covers Selma, Jim Crow laws, and how demographic shifts can be more destructive than nuclear weapons.

In the members’ hour, we consider the endgame of diversity and multiculturalism. Paul explains that the Democratic Party is nothing more than a coalition of different factions united by their hatred of White America. This, he argues, is a dangerous thing, for the revolution in Haiti – which involved freed black slaves massacring Whites and mulattoes – shows what can happen when non-Whites take over White civilization. We discuss how the current awakening of White racial consciousness was not supposed to take place. Paul argues that the current atmosphere of implicit Whiteness can become explicit in the blink of an eye; and once that happens, there will be no going back. The members’ hour concludes with a discussion on how recent virtue signalling from major corporations – including Macy’s and Target – has completely backfired, as many Americans are becoming increasingly disgusted by appeals to the liberal status quo.

Title: Operation Reinhard - Implicit Race War
Date: 2017-02-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_w2m_8aOMdw
Description: America is fracturing along implicitly racial lines. Contrary to what mainstream conservatives and liberals might say, Trump is not the cause of this division; he merely brought this simmering conflict to the surface. By daring to tell the truth about immigration, globalism, and multiculturalism, he gave a voice to White America – a demographic that, prior to his arrival, was seemingly content to go quietly into the night.

Title: Brett Stevens - Nihilism: Deconstructing Modernity
Date: 2017-02-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=JxWe6S6ejjE
Description: Brett Stevens writes on the topics of nihilism, deep ecology, nationalism and anti-work. He has been published at American Renaissance, RightOn, Alternative Right, Return Of Kings, Nihil and the blog where he serves as editor, Amerika.org. His first book, Nihilism, was published via Numen Books in 2016.

Brett joins us for an enlightening conversation on nihilism, traditionalism, nationalism, and much more. We begin by talking about Brett’s ideological journey, which began with anarcho-capitalism and eventually led him to Neoreaction and the Alt-Right. Brett then tells us about his book, Nihilism. We learn that nihilism in this context doesn’t refer to an absence of values, but rather a philosophical process by which one discards all preconceived notions in order to discover the truth. This process, Brett explains, is rooted in realism, for it eschews emotional perspectives and concerns for arbitrary social norms. We then discuss consequentialism, which leads to a consideration of the role of violence in civilization. The first hour also delves into what we can learn from nature, the idea that all institutions are businesses, and the true meaning of collectivism.

In the members’ hour, we begin with a discussion on the true nature of the Left. Brett points out that the Left attacks those who disagree with it, whereas the Right only attacks in self-defense. We discuss the importance of realism, which Brett contrasts with perspectives rooted in concerns for what is considered socially acceptable at a particular point in time. We then switch gears to talk about the Alt-Right. Brett compares the Alt-Right to the mythic hero’s journey, and differentiates between people who are good at a specific set of modern skills and those who are able to obtain a more transcendent understanding of the universe. Later, we discuss transhumanism, which Brett argues is the contemporary Left’s answer to eugenics. The members’ hour contains discussing on a number of other topics, including futurism, traditionalism, and the Balkanization of America.

Title: Kevin MacDonald & Andrew Joyce - Leftist Violence in Trump’s America
Date: 2017-02-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=mdjdfg0_NIk
Description: Dr. Kevin MacDonald has a Ph.D. in Biobehavioral Sciences and is an expert on Jewish influence and identity. He is also the editor and chief contributor of The Occidental Observer, an online publication that focuses on White identity, White interests, and the culture of the West. Dr. Andrew Joyce is a scholar, speaker, and writer with academic expertise on immigration, ethnic and religious conflict, and philosophy. Andrew sits on the editorial advisory board of The Occidental Quarterly and is also a regular contributor to The Occidental Observer.

Kevin and Andrew return to Red Ice for a fascinating discussion on escalating Leftist violence, Trump’s presidency, and much more. We begin by looking back on Trump’s first two weeks in office. Kevin discusses the hysteria on the Left, while Andrew tells us that he is pleasantly surprised to see Donald Trump deliver on his promises. We talk about the Trump administration’s plans to cease monitoring “White supremacist” organizations, and instead direct its counter-extremism efforts towards radical Islamists. Later, we switch gears to consider the increasingly violent nature of the Left and the future of civil unrest in America. We discuss the recent riots at UC Berkeley, Black Lives Matter, and Inauguration Day violence. The first hour also covers the petition to ban Trump from the UK and the specifics of his 90-day travel ban.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the Left’s silence over Trump killing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We observe how the Left, which has historically been concerned with economic issues and workers’ rights, is now more concerned with pushing an anti-White agenda. Kevin traces this back to the Frankfurt School, whose thinkers became disenchanted with the White working class after it supported Hitler in Germany. We discuss how this led to Jewish intellectuals becoming increasingly distrustful of White populism – a trend that continues to this day. Later, we talk about Jared Kushner, and consider whether or not there is a group of “rogue Jews” surrounding Trump who wish to take America in a different direction – for the sake of both Israel and America. The members’ hour also explores Trump’s statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Steve Bannon, and the problem with excessive individuality in the West.

Title: Jason Reza Jorjani - The Iranian Renaissance & Aryan Imperium
Date: 2017-02-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XkQfp2GmZH4
Description: Jason Reza Jorjani, PhD is a native New Yorker and Iranian-American of Persian and Northern European descent. After receiving his BA and MA at New York University, he completed his doctorate in Philosophy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Jorjani currently teaches Science, Technology, and Society (STS) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He is the author of Prometheus and Atlas (Arktos, 2016). Dr. Jorjani is also a member of the Iranian Renaissance movement.

Jason returns to Red Ice for another fascinating show, this time on the subject of Iran. To begin, Jason tells us about the Iranian Renaissance Movement, including its history and goals. Jason clears up some misconceptions about the movement, and assures us that its success would only benefit Europeans. We then dive into the history of Iran, starting with the Aryans. We discussing the origins of the very term “Aryan”, and clarify that the Aryans were, in fact, White. Jason sheds light on the relationship between ancient Iran and classical Greece, explaining that the Iranian spirit had far more in common with Sparta than Athens. The first half of our show also deals with a variety of historical figures in Iranian history, including Zarathustra, Cyrus, and Ferdowsi, in addition to touching on many other aspects of Iranian history.

In the members’ segment, we continue our conversation on the history of Iran. We begin by discussing the Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the visionary ruler who modernized Iran but was later forced into exile after a Western-backed coup. Jason tells us about the the Islamist takeover in 1979, and we ponder why Western elites would want Iran to become an Islamic theocracy. We discuss Barack Obama’s betrayal of Iranians, the Arab Spring, and the rise of Isis. Jason explains how to Make Iran Great Again, and outlines his hopes for Trump’s Iran policy. The members’ segment also explores Iran’s place in the wider Indo-European World, and the possibility of an Indo-European World Order.

Title: Swan of Tuonela - Finnish Nationalism and Thoughts on American Alt-Right
Date: 2017-02-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MBDVBrix3Ok
Description: Swan of Tuonela is a Finnish nationalist and Vlogger. 

Swan joins us for an interesting conversation on Finland, nationalism, and multiculturalism. We begin by discussing the origins of her name. Swan tells us that it derives from Finnish mythology, and proceeds to explain how the folktales and fables from her homeland are quite different from those of other European countries. We discuss Swan’s red-pill process, which began when she started questioning the migrant crisis. This leads to a discussion on Finnish nationalism. Swan tells us that most Finns are opposed to mass immigration, but that the nationalist scene in Finland is defined by a plurality of groups which don’t always get along. We discuss the mainstream media in Finland, which is, unsurprisingly, working against the interests of indigenous Finns. Our show also covers migrant rape in Finland, LGBT organizations, Russophobia, and much more.

Title: Matt Battaglioli - The Consequences of Equality
Date: 2017-02-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6YKaVR_Jx5c
Description: Matthew Battaglioli is a dedicated lover of the social sciences. He was educated through the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama, where he passed his exams on economics with honors status. He is a member of the Liberate RVA organization and has written academic material for the Ludwig von Mises Institute, Liberate RVA, and The Libertarian Alliance. Matthew is also the author of The Consequences of Equality.

We begin by discussing the recently inaugurated Donald Trump. Matt tells us that he generally distrusts politicians; as such, he’s pleasantly surprised to see Trump fulfilling his promises. We then discuss Matt’s book, The Consequences of Equality. We learn that his experiences in college – in particular, discussing social issues with liberals – led him to question the notion of equality. This leads to a discussion on the history of this oft-fetishized concept; in particular, we discuss how John Locke’s ideas concerning equality are misunderstood in the modern era. The first hour also covers the Alt-Right, Bolshevism, and ends on the topic of economics and banking.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on economics. We talk about the US debt, and consider the possibility of an upcoming recession. Matt argues that an economy is a reflection of time preference, and that economics can make or break a civilization. We then ponder how we can free ourselves from this debt-based economic system. Switching gears, we discuss moral relativism and legality. This leads to a discussion on Islam, liberalism, and how the average Leftist cannot be persuaded by facts. The members’ hour also explores Islam, gender roles, and what is necessary to maintain real diversity.

Title: Greg Johnson - Doxing Only Works Once
Date: 2017-01-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=zjtuwj5zzg8
Description: This show first uploaded January 20th to redice.tv

Dr. Greg Johnson is the editor-in-chief of Counter-Currents and its journal, North American New Right. Greg is also the author of Confessions of a Reluctant Hater, New Right vs. Old Right, and Truth, Justice, and a Nice White Country.

Greg returns to discuss recent developments in American politics, the Alt-Right, and elsewhere. To begin, we dive into the doxing of Millennial Woes. We consider the reasons why the Left favors doxing. Greg reminds us that they dox us because it works; since our views are so heavily stigmatized, being associated with them carries a social cost. We then discuss the media treatment of Millennial Woes, and how shining such a spotlight on someone speaking the truth can backfire. Later, we talk about “Hailgate”, which leads to a discussion on the effectiveness of trolling versus building real-world networks. This show also explores the recent doxing of Mike Enoch, which raised quite a bit of controversy. Greg tells us why he supports Mike Enoch. (Note: The first interview Mike did after his identity was revealed has been taken down.)

Brittany then tells us about life in California, including its demographic transformation. We consider the increasingly popular Calexit proposition, and what its success would spell for the rest of the country. Switching gears, we talk about Brittany’s trip to Trump’s inauguration, which leads to a discussion on Trump’s presidency thus far.

Title: Bre Faucheux - The Problem with Diversity in Books
Date: 2017-01-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2ruVfZoIERM
Description: Bre Faucheux is an author and YouTuber.

She joins us for a lively conversation on race, identity, and multiculturalism. We begin by discussing her background, including her education and how she came to be red-pilled. While Bre was initially a liberal, she eventually discovered Alt-Right videos on YouTube, which led her to question everything she had been taught. The growing prevalence of anti-White rhetoric in the West also forced her to realize that diversity threatens the very existence of ethnic Europeans worldwide. We then discuss Bre’s YouTube video, “The Problem With Diversity in Books”, which triggered thousands of liberals, and listen to a few amusing responses from some of them. Our show also explores the West’s ongoing demographic transformation, MGTOW, and feminism.

Title: Jim Goad - The War on Whites Reaches New Heights
Date: 2017-01-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=CLWp-m2cd_U
Description: Jim Goad is an American author and publisher. He co-authored and published the magazine ANSWER ME! and The Redneck Manifesto.

We begin by discussing Jim’s background and what inspired him to write The Redneck Manifesto. Jim tells us about his ideological journey, which began with liberalism, but quickly deviated from the status quo. We learn that Jim, who describes himself as a skeptic, began questioning the dogma of our day, such as anti-racism and diversity, and eventually came to realize that there is a war on Whites and masculinity. His experiences in prison also forced him to accept the realities of tribalism and racial identity – realities that the Left fails to account for. This leads to a discussion on the modern Left, which has become similar to creationism in its denial of inconvenient scientific evidence. The first hour also touches on Trump, the myth of equality, and how name-calling is the sign of a bad argument.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the recent wave of Russophobia that has been sweeping the West. Jim explains that our ruling elite is using Russia as a scapegoat and blaming the Eurasian country for rising populism in the West. We discuss World War II, and draw attention to the slanted, post-war narrative espoused by the victors. While on the subject, Jim reminds us that General Patton later lamented the outcome of the war and stated that America was wrong to side with Communist Russia against Germany. Switching gears, we discuss the “Kalergi Plan”, a name given to Coudenhove-Kalergi’s various writings which advocated destroying the ethnic heritage of Europe through mass miscegenation. The members’ hour also explores individualism, collectivism, and the ongoing efforts to feminize Western men.

Title: Nick Monroe - Milo, DeploraBall & GamerGate
Date: 2017-01-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=W7W6aSmxJx8
Description: Nick is a gaming journalist who has worked for The Escapist Magazine and Gameranx. Intimately involved with GamerGate since its inception, he witnessed Milo’s rise to popularity firsthand.

We begin by discussing the history of GamerGate. Nick tells us how the growing prevalence of diversity propaganda in gaming journalism led to major pushback from fans. We learn how Milo Yiannopoulos appeared on the scene and used GamerGate to build a personal brand for himself. This leads to a consideration of Milo’s shady behavior. We discuss the suspicious details surrounding his White privilege grant, which Nick cites as the beginning of his apprehensions about Milo. We learn that Milo deposited the grant money into his personal bank account, and later attempted to pay someone off for drawing attention to this. The first hour also covers Milo’s true motivations, accusations of ghostwriting, and the DeploraBall drama.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on Milo. We consider the ways in which Milo, a Jewish homosexual, uses his victim group membership to his advantage. Switching gears, we discuss his book deal, and ponder whether or not it will be written by ghostwriters. We discuss how Alt-Lite figures like Milo seem to be intent on occupying an “edgy, but not too edgy” niche, and do not want to fully pursue the truth. We then ponder what the next GamerGate will be, and if it’s already happening now. The members’ hour also explores the story of Brianna Wu, the end goal of diversity, and what the future holds for Milo.

Title: Tuukka - Suomen Sisu: Finnish Resistance to Globalism
Date: 2017-01-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=GPYzAaJJAl0
Description: Tuukka is a university student and member of Suomen Sisu, a Finnish nationalist organization.

We begin by discussing the recent 612 demonstration that took place in Helsinki. Scheduled on December 6, Finland’s day of independence, the event drew thousands of patriots and a sizable amount of Leftists as well. We discuss the ongoing efforts from the Left to redefine what it means to be Finnish, and the motivations that lie behind these efforts. This leads to a discussion on the history of non-White immigration to Finland. We’ll learn how the collapse of the Soviet Union was led to Somalis entering Finland, and how this country’s demographic plight differs from that of Sweden. The first hour concludes with a reflection on how Finland changed over the course of 2016.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discuss the Soldiers of Odin, including their origins and why they no longer have a significant presence in Sweden. We then briefly touch on the negative stereotypes many people harbor about nationalist. Switching gears, Tuukka explains that most peoples throughout history have ceased to be; continuing, he argues that this process happens as the result of a more dominant, dynamic group replacing or absorbing lesser ones. We then discuss the anti-White and anti-male propaganda so prevalent in the current year. Tuukka tells us that he hopes the Left continues this assault, for only helps the nationalism grow. The members’ hour also covers the red herring that is radical Islam, racism as an explanation for differing success between groups, and what 2017 may have in store for us.

Title: P䲠֢erg & Simon Lindberg - Party Platform of the Nordic Resistance Movement
Date: 2017-01-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1HAj99MxJEc
Description: Pär Öberg is Chief of the Parliamentary branch of the Nordic Resistance Movement and is a city council member in Ludvika, a small town in Sweden. He is also the spokesman of the organization in Swedish media and one of three permanent hosts of Radio Nordfront. Simon Lindberg is 33 years old and has been involved with nationalism since his early teens. A father of three, Simon has been the leader of The Nordic Resistance Movement for over a year.

Our show focuses on the Nordic Resistance Movement (Nordfront), a National Socialist organization with branches in Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden. We begin by discussing National Socialism, a form of social organization that is unfortunately misunderstood by most. Pär and Simon are careful to differentiate between the ideology of National Socialism and the actions of the Third Reich, as advocating for a socialist state with a strong sense of nationalism doesn’t inevitably result in concentration camps and gassings. We then begin going through Nordfront’s nine-point plan for sociopolitical change, which includes ending mass immigration and creating a unified Nordic nation.

In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion Nordfront’s nine-point plan. Pär and Simon argue for the need for a strong government – one that guarantees free speech and exists for the good of the people. We discuss the need truth in society, especially when it comes to politics, and consider the benefit of holding politicians legally responsible for their words. We then touch on the mainstream media, which at this time works against the interests of the people, and often towards the benefit of various international groups and interests. This leads to a discussion on Anna Hagwall, a Swedish politician fired for addressing the fact that the Bonnier family owns much of the media in Sweden. The members’ hour also covers Nordfront’s positions on the economy, trade, military, and more.

Title: Ingrid & Conrad - Merry Yule: Swedish Government is Afraid of the Swedes
Date: 2016-12-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=hLlhW29b0bA
Description: Ingrid Carlqvist worked in mainstream media for many years, before starting Dispatch International with Lars Hedegaard in 2012. She has been a writer for Gatestone Institute and co-hosts the popular Swedish podcast, Ingrid & Conrad. Daniel Frändelöv – a former leftie – who goes by the name Conrad, has been running the popular Swedish podcast Ingrid & Conrad since 2015. For the past five six years, he's been preoccupied with the thought of the destruction of Sweden and was previously the co-host of Radio Länsman.

Ingrid and Conrad return once more to discuss the present state of affairs in Sweden. We begin by talking about a recent Lucia advertisement that featured a black child in lieu of a Swedish one, and touch on the various responses this has elicited in Sweden. This leads to a consideration of how Sweden ended up in its current state of affairs, at which point Ingrid offers a rather unique explanation. We then consider the Russophobia that swept the West in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory. Conrad points out the absurdity of the Swedish government – an entity engaged in the ethnic cleansing of its native population – claiming that Russia is fueling anti-government sentiments among the Swedes. The first hour concludes with Ingrid and Conrad telling us their plans for the future.

We begin the members’ hour by talking about the war on Christmas. Switching gears, we discuss the Left’s assumption that White people should “know better” – meaning that the barbarous behavior of non-Whites is often excused. As an example of this, Conrad mentions that Western nations decry Russia’s supposedly inhumane treatment of gays while ignoring the fact that they’re treated far worse in the Middle East. This leads to a discussion on the rape crisis in Sweden, wherein immigrant rapists generally receive far more lenient sentences than native Swedes for similar crimes. We discuss the non-White crime epidemic in Malmö, and how the police cannot fully investigate many crimes out of fear of being called “racists.” The members’ hour also contains discussion on how to save Sweden, gender differences, and the importance of leading by example.

Title: Patrick Le Brun - The Truth Behind Assassin’s Creed & Templar Plots
Date: 2016-12-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=B-egSXnKiw0
Description: Patrick Le Brun is a writer and activist who has written many articles for Counter-Currents. He has extensive experience with the French Identitarian movement. He is currently based in the United States, where he mentors college students who wish to engage in activism.

Patrick returns once again for yet another enthralling conversation, this time on the Assassin’s Creed video game series. We begin by discussing the fact that the creators of this franchise are clearly well versed in esoteric themes, such as metagenetics (Red Ice members, perhaps?). We then delve into the historical background of Assassin’s Creed. Patrick tells us about the Fatimid Caliphate, the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam, and the myth of the Islamic “Golden Age” in Spain. We learn that the collapse of the Fatimid Empire, which was actually quite philosophical, marked the closing of the Muslim mind and forced Neoplatonists and other esoteric thinkers to go underground. The first hour also gives ample consideration to the Knights Templar and their relationship to the Ismaili assassins.

In the members’ hour, we pick up where we left off and continue our conversation on the assassins. We discuss the blending of myth and history that defines many modern day understandings of this mysterious group. Patrick describes the process through which young boys became assassins, which often involved the use of drugs, such as hashish. We learn about the more esoteric teachings of the Ismaili assassins, and discuss the meaning of the phrase “nothing is true, everything is permitted.” This leads to consideration of the power of faith; Henrik argues that, regardless of if one’s religion is metaphysically correct, faith can allow one to overcome the fear of death and perform great feats. The members’ hour then delves deeper into the secrets of the Ismaili sect, including its recent history and relevance to modern politics. To conclude, Patrick offers advice to those interested in taking a more active role in the battle to save Western civilization.

Title: Styxhexenhammer666 - Occult Rule: Are the Globalists Satanists?
Date: 2016-12-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=rRb7KA5LRrE
Description: Styxhexenhammer666 is an occultist and author. He is also known for his YouTube videos, which cover a wide array of topics such as magic, gardening, and politics.

Styx joins us for a fascinating discussion on some of the more bizarre things that have come to light during the past election cycle. We discuss John Podesta, Marina Abramović, and spirit cooking. Styx dispels a number of misconceptions that many still harbor about the relationship between our ruling elite and the power of the occult. We then discuss Bohemian Grove, which, in Styx’s words, is nothing more than a playground for the rich to pretend that their obsession with power and money is actually making them happy. Styx argues that the elite may in fact intentionally give fuel to conspiracy theories, promoting the idea that they are diabolical overlords to intimidate the masses into inaction. The first hour also touches on fake news and geopolitics, giving ample consideration to the Chinese question.

In the members’ hour, we’ll dive deeper into esoteric topics, such as magic and the left hand path. Styx offers a brief history of magic, and reminds us that many things once thought to be magic are now considered science. We discuss the importance of self-transformation in the magical path; in particular, Styx stresses the need for self-control, arguing that a lack thereof will only lead one to be controlled by another person. Switching gears, we consider Aleister Crowley and the Ordo Templi Orientis, and whether or not this branch of occultism has any validity. This leads to an illuminating discussion on organized religion – in particular, the history, theology, and inconsistencies of the three Abrahamic faiths. The members’ hour also covers the difference between Lucifer and Satan, the ongoing Islamic invasion of Europe, and the power of memetics.

Title: Erica - What Is White Identity? - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-12-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Nki9wWafteM
Description: Erica is a Florida-based, 26-year-old White identity advocate known for her Twitter commentary on social and political issues.

We begin by discussing the role of women in the Alt-Right, and clear up some common misconceptions about traditional women. Erica then describes her journey to the Alt-Right, telling us that her interest in Donald Trump led to the discovery of Richard Spencer, Millennial Woes, and so forth. We discuss the importance of identity in the modern world – especially for people of European heritage. We play a few clips from the Q&A portion of Richard’s recent appearance at Texas A&M, and comment on the mentality of the average college student today. Our show concludes with a discussion on the fact that women in the West, despite what feminists might say, are far better off than in any other part of the world – especially the Middle East.

Title: Tom Sunic - The New Right and the Religion of Multiculturalism
Date: 2016-12-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=FpxJiARBprk
Description: Tomislav Sunic was born in Zagreb, Croatia, in 1953. The son of a Catholic dissident, he studied French and English Language and Literature at the University of Zagreb until 1978. He earned a master’s degree at California State University, Sacramento, in 1985, and later received a doctorate in political science in 1988 from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Tom has published a number of books, including Homo Americanus: Child of the Postmodern Age (BookSurge, 2007) and Against Democracy and Equality: The European New Right (Arktos, 2016).

The show begins with a consideration of the New Right: its origins, what it’s about, and who’s behind it. We discuss history of the term itself, which many New Right thinkers dislike; Tom, for example, tells us that he instead sees himself as part of the non-conformist right. This leads to a discussion on the establishment’s use of labels and buzzwords to prevent people from thinking further into such matters. We then switch gears and delve into the recent “fake news” lunacy that has swept post-election America. Tom explains that this phenomenon is nothing more than the mainstream media’s panicked attempt to retain power as it is displaced by alternative media. The first hour also covers the migrant crisis, Germany’s plight, and the religion of multiculturalism.

The members’ hour starts off with a discussion on the future. We consider what it will take for the masses to realize that multiculturalism simply will not produce anything other than misery and societal decay. Tom recommends that we adopt a more proactive strategy, which includes organizing on a local level. We then discuss the Alt-Right – in particular, how our movement has successfully used irony and humor to combat the Left and faux-Right. And like the 60s-era Left, the Alt-Right is appealing to young people because it is understood to be something truly counter-cultural and rebellious. The members’ hour also touches on the economic impact of the migrant crisis, weaponized guilt, and how nationalism, although unfairly maligned, is actually the best solution to many global problems.

Title: Daniel Friberg - Rising From the Ruins: Identitarian Movement in Europe
Date: 2016-12-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kqFammtIDWg
Description: Daniel Friberg holds an MBA from the Gothenburg Business School, and former CEO of the Swedish mining company Wiking Mineral, and a founding member of the Swedish metapolitical think-tank Motpol. He is one of the founders of Arktos Media Ltd. He is also the author of Högern kommer tillbaka: Handbok för den äkta oppositionen (Arktos, 2015), and its English translation, The Real Right Returns: A Handbook for the True Opposition (Arktos, 2015). He was also the translator of the Swedish-language edition of Michael O’Meara’s New Culture, New Right: Anti-Liberalism in Postmodern Europe, Den nya högern (Arktos, 2015).

The show begins Daniel sharing with us his thoughts on Trump’s recent victory, which he believes will prove quite beneficial to the Alt-Right. We briefly discuss the Alt-Right’s history thus far, with Daniel pointing out that our movement draws people from both sides of the political spectrum. We then consider what the establishment can do to thwart the Alt-Right’s rise to power. Daniel argues that any attempts to crack down on us will only ensure that we remain in the spotlight. Switching gears, we discuss the Trump effect, including the various ways in which world leaders have responded to his victory. The first hour also touches on the Identitarian movement in Europe, and the future of Arktos.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the situation in Europe. Daniel points out that mass multiculturalism has initiated a process of polarization, by which people are forced to pick a side. He also reminds us that the defining dialectic of our day is not left versus right, but rather nationalism versus globalism. This polarization, Daniel argues, will cause civic nationalists to drift towards the Alt-Right. This leads to further discussion on our nascent movement, including what we need to do over the course of the next year. Daniel advises that us to never get lazy, and to be relentless in working towards our interests. Our show concludes with a consideration of how we can appeal to newcomers.

Title: Seth Cooper - Egalitarianism vs Aristocratic Values & Aspects of Fascism - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-12-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-DqjUfqj_2c
Description: Seth Cooper, a lifelong devotee of fantasy and mythology, graduated Summa Cum Laude from Mount Saint Mary’s University, having earned a philosophy degree in 2001. He lives by himself in the rural Northern Neck of Virginia where he continues to realize the far-reaching series that begins with The Glorious Path, his debut novel.

Our show begins with Lana asking Seth how he felt about the recent NPI controversy. Quite predictably, Seth saw through the media’s outrageous spin on the aforementioned shenanigans. We then dive into the topic of equality, differentiating between being equal under the law and equal in a more existential sense. Seth argues for a return to aristocratic values – that is, a worldview that recognizes that people vary in ability, skill, and potential. This leads to an interesting discussion on the three main ethical theories in Western philosophy. We then discuss fascism – a concept that is painfully misunderstood by the masses – and conclude our show with a consideration of the Alt-Right.

Description: We laugh at another Canadian tax payer funded propaganda video called, The Dangerous Game: Gamergate and the "Alt-Right." An unattractive feminist studying “accessibility in gaming” claims she's experienced “acts of violence” while gaming online as a female. Somehow, random men talking dirty online is linked to “right wing extremism and the Alt-Right.”

Description: We talk about the new UN secretary general António Guterres, the former Prime Minister of Portugal, who is yet another globalist elite pushing for the eradication of sovereign European nations. He was also the head of Socialist International which claims to be working towards a “fairer world.”

We connect the Socialist International agenda with Third Way politics that was spearheaded by Tony Blair & Bill Clinton, both proponents of mass migration, eradication of borders and enemies of national sovereignty.

Title: Andrew Anglin - Somalian Refugee Nightmare & Trump’s Fix
Date: 2016-12-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=itY2DoxJ4Vo
Description: Andrew Anglin is the founder of Daily Stormer and has written countless articles on race realism, nationalism, Jewish influence, and social degeneracy.

We begin by discussing the recent terrorist attack at Ohio State University. Since Andrew hails from Ohio, he’s able to offer us a firsthand perspective on the – and growing – Somali community in his home state. We learn that the Somalian refugees are overwhelmingly unemployed; many, though, are involved in illegal activities, such as heroin trafficking. Unlike other immigrant groups, such as Mexicans or Indians, Somalians aren’t brought in by the elite as a cheap labor force. In light of this, we ponder why our ruling class is intent on importing large numbers of people who are, biologically and culturally, very different from us. This leads to a discussion on the issue of Muslim rape gangs in Europe, and how decades of Jewish control of newspapers have pushed a narrative that have convinced White people that it is moral to commit racial and cultural suicide.

The members’ hour begins with a consideration of Jill Stein’s recent push for a vote recount in Michigan. We laugh at the absurdity of the situation, and Andrew reminds us that the recount will ultimately prove meaningless. Switching gears, we discuss the fact that some people still believe Trump is a Jewish puppet; Andrew half-jokingly suggests that the notion of Trump being part of a Jewish conspiracy is itself a conspiracy benefiting Jewish interests. While on the subject, we take a critical look at Trump’s relationship to the Jewish community. Andrew stresses the fact that, regardless of how much praise Trump lavishes on Israel, his policies stand in opposition to the globalist machinations of worldwide ZOG. The members’ hour also includes Andrew’s thoughts on the recent NPI controversy.

Title: Jeanice Barcelo - Pornography: Weaponized Degeneracy
Date: 2016-12-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=C2hOJR0hIBY
Description: Jeanice Barcelo, M.A., is a birth doula and independent childbirth educator, specializing in the prevention and healing of birth trauma. She is the author of Birth Trauma and the Dark Side of Modern Medicine. Through her radio and television shows, Jeanice has worked tirelessly to expose the evils of pornography, pedophile rings, Jewish supremacism, and more.

We begin by discussing Trump’s recent victory. Jeanice tells us that she believes this is not only a sign that the elite’s power is waning, but that there is a positive, spiritual force propelling Trump. We talk about the fact that many within the conspiracy community still think Trump is controlled opposition; this, according to Jeanice, is a poor, defeatist attitude. Transitioning to our main topic, pornography and sexuality, we discuss the ways in which sexual deviancy are used to undermine the positive, life-affirming values traditionally found in the West. Jeanice explains to us that this is merely part of a greater, Satanic attack on life itself. The first hour also touches on Jewish sexual mores, Sigmund Freud, and the question of transexuality.

In the members’ hour, we delve deeper into the topic of pornography. Jeanice urges us to see pornography as a weapon, rather than an idle amusement. We discuss the fact that sexuality exists to bring new life into world, and that fornication, being rooted in carnality, therefore lies outside of the natural order. Jeanice then outlines what she believes to be the truth behind pornography, which includes occult rituals and demonic forces. We discuss how pornography and sexual degeneracy have been snuck into the mainstream with very minimal pushback from conservative organizations. The members’ hour also explores the various ways in which sexual degeneracy is pushed on children.

Title: Reality Calls - #PizzaGate: The Elite are Involved with Pedophilia
Date: 2016-11-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oSLKt1Veg6U
Description: Tara, also known as Reality Calls, is a British YouTuber. Although she originally created her channel to discuss veganism, she has since transitioned to covering politics and unpopular truths. Reinhard joins us for this show as well.

We begin by diving into #PizzaGate. We discuss the origins of the scandal, which lie in John Podesta’s leaked emails. These emails were found to contain strange references to pizza and hotdogs. Eventually, internet sleuths were able to determine that these were actually codes for something else. This led to the discovery of Comet Ping Pong, a pizza shop in Washington D.C. with intimate connections to The Democratic Party. We discuss how this pizza shop, despite seeming normal from the outside, appears to be the front for an elaborate pedophile network. The first hour also covers Satanism, spirit cooking, and whether or not Podesta and friends are serious occult practitioners.

The members’ hour starts with a discussion on the untimely deaths of a few truth seekers. We mull over Andrew Breitbart’s apparent knowledge of Podesta’s involvement in underage sex trafficking, and also discuss Max Spiers, who recently died under mysterious circumstances while investigating organized pedophilia. We consider the role that pedophilia plays in the global power structure, and agree that the elite cater to the twisted desires of their subordinates in order to gain control over them. We then explore why many people refuse to even look at the evidence for #PizzaGate – despite the fact that members of the elite have been convicted of pedophilia on many occasions. To conclude our show, we consider what can be done to ensure that those complicit in #PizzaGate are – legally – brought to justice.

Title: Jay Dyer - Esoteric Hollywood: How to Destroy the Entertainment-Industrial Complex
Date: 2016-11-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gFI_-J7-10Q
Description: Jay Dyer is a public speaker, lecturer, comedian and author of Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film, as well as the host of the JaysAnalysis Podcast/Esoteric Hollywood. He is also a regular contributor to 21stCenturyWire, Soul of the East and the Espionage History Archive. Jay's work covers a wide variety of subjects, including metaphysics, film analysis, theology, geopolitics, literature, and history.

We begin by discussing Hollywood: its history, significance, and, most importantly, how to destroy it. Jay references Plato, who argued that you cannot have complete freedom of the arts because degeneracy can harm society. Jay also relates this to democracy, explaining that an elite can, through the arts, make man easier to control by appealing to his base desires. We discuss the fact that film has, since its inception, been linked to powerful interests, such as the military and the mafia. We consider the nature of culture, and how it must be altered prior to any political change; Hollywood, having the ability to influence one’s perception of reality, has a played a significant role in this process. The first hour also covers spirit cooking, Satanism, and #Pizzagate.

In the members’ hour, we consider the future of film. Jay argues that, not unlike the book, film is on its way out. This isn’t to say that people will abruptly stop watching movies altogether, but rather that feature length films will gradually decline in popularity. We then discuss the cult of sensitivity that has reached disastrous proportions among the millennial generation. Henrik predicts that these people will eventually retreat into the Matrix to avoid a world filled with microagressions and misgenderings. Jay reminds us that the New World Order endeavors to erase not only distinctions and differences, but change as well. The members’ hour also contains discussion on the nature of art, the left’s war on tradition, and ends with an overview of Jay’s new book, Esoteric Hollywood.

Title: Daniel Hammarberg - Abrahamic Religion: The Dark Side of Judaism
Date: 2016-11-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=fpDeXVkZYvM
Description: Daniel Hammarberg is a native Swede who has written many articles on current events and social issues. He has also worked with the anti-pedophile movement Nätverket Stoppa Pedofilerna, publicizing the identities, crimes and physical whereabouts of convicted child molesters – information that Swedish authorities keep hidden. When he is not writing or engaged in activism, Daniel enjoys sea swimming and powerlifting.

To begin, we dive into the main topic of our show: religion. We touch on the history of the three main Abrahamic religions, and discuss how modern Christianity is, in many ways, quite ahistorical. Daniel calls attention to Evangelicals in particular, arguing that they are incorrect for believing that Jews are the chosen people, as their covenant with God ended after the coming of Christ. We then discuss the Spanish Inquisition, which Daniel provides as an example of the real relationship between Christianity and Judaism. While on the subject, Daniel reads a few choice passages from Martin Luther concerning the Jews. The first hour concludes with a discussion on the dark side of Judaism.

In the members’ hour, Daniel offers a fascinating comparison between Judaism and National Socialism. He argues that both emphasize a military savior, the importance of blood ties, and the desire to conquer others. We then discuss the true nature of diversity, and how it is threatened by unchecked miscegenation. Back on the subject of religion, we consider whether or not the events depicted in the Bible are historically accurate. Daniel argues that, while there may be a degree of historical truth to them, they are mostly exaggerated. We take the opportunity to explore the possibility that various Biblical accounts of God were actually descriptions of natural events, such as volcano eruptions. The show concludes with a discussion on what we can learn from the tragedy of the USS Liberty.

Title: Piero San Giorgio - Women on the Verge of Societal Breakdown - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-11-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7YaZz7go3nI
Description: Piero San Giorgio is a former businessman and software executive. For the past decade, he has studied the global economic system and its dependence on ever-expanding populations, debt, and resource exploitation. Piero is also the author of two books, Survive the Economic Collapse and Women on the Verge of Societal Breakdown.

We begin by discussing women in modern society. Piero points out that women have never had more rights at any other point in history. Despite this, Piero notes that men are still the leading voices within the greater movement to save the West. Upon coming to this realization, Piero set out to discover why this is the case. We discuss the fact that Western women, while certainly having more freedom now than ever, have been convinced that consumerism and careerism are better than having a family. The show also covers the ongoing rape epidemic in Europe, the dangers of endless growth, and the interplay between progress and tradition.

Title: Guillaume Durocher - Trump Victory: Impact on America & Europe
Date: 2016-11-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6hSpzqSwE-0
Description: Guillaume Durocher is a French political writer and historian. He has lived in many European countries and worked in politics and journalism. He writes for several Alt-Right publications, including The Occidental Observer, Counter-Currents, and Radix.

We begin by discussing the results of the recent election. Guillaume compares Trump’s victory to Brexit, for the mainstream media – through its polls and pundits – failed to accurately predict either. We discuss what this means for not only America, but the West as a whole. Guillaume explains that the American nation-state is now run by a wildcard, and that if Trump drastically alters the course of America, Europe will follow suit. We then discuss Guillaume’s background, including how he became a nationalist. We learn that he was originally an anti-war liberal; questioning the EU, however, led him to then realize the importance of having homogeneous nation-states. The first hour also explores the ongoing culture war in the West, the Jewish community’s response to the Trump phenomenon, and the origins of our current plight.

The members’ hour begins with a consideration of technology. We discuss how the internet has allowed for alternative media to loosen the mainstream media’s control over culture and information. Guillaume correctly points out that Trump, through his condemnation of the mainstream media, has furthered this effect. We then switch gears to consider the big picture. Guillaume argues that it’s okay for those of us in the Alt-Right to disagree about the ideal form of government; what matters, though, is that whichever system we adopt exist solely for the benefit of our people. Guillaume then makes a case for the inclusion of genetics into policymaking decisions, which leads to a discussion on the massive population boom now underway in the third world. The members’ hour also covers the need for willpower and determination, the vulgarization of Western culture, and the tribal nature of fascism.

Title: John Lash - Eight Unifying Points for Truth Seekers & Knowledge Holders
Date: 2016-11-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=IH9_1Cvk7Cs
Description: John Lash is a self-educated, free-lance scholar with an interest in mythology, magic, and religion. He is a pioneer of directive mythology, the application of myth to life. John runs Metahistory.org and is the author of The Seeker's Handbook, Twins and the Double, The Hero - Manhood and Power, Quest for the Zodiac, and Not in His Image.

Our show opens with a discussion on truth seeking. We differentiate between ultimate and conditional truth, the former being an ultimate realization, whereas the latter is defined as the truth about a particular event or topic. We then attempt to outline a set of criteria for truth-seekers, that is, the enlightened consensus on a number of salient issues: Jewish influence, Holocaust revisionism, White genocide, Cultural Marxism, Communism, and much more. We consider how humanity’s base desires and inclinations can be directed toward the realization of our divine, superhuman nature. This show also covers the true nature of wisdom, religious experience, and how the truth cannot remain hidden indefinitely.

Title: Emily Youcis - The Ascent of Art in the Alt-Right - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-11-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=H7oIRfzdaIo
Description: Emily Youcis is an animator and director of the Alfred Alfer movie.

We begin by discussing how Emily came to be red-pilled. She explains that growing up in Philadelphia forced her to come to terms with racial differences, as black-on-White crime in Philly is extremely prevalent. Emily then tells us about her interactions with liberals at the DNC, and we play a few highlights from her video of the event. We discuss her animation background, which thus far has been centered around Alfred Alfer, the main character in Emily’s work. We then play her newest film, The Ascent of Alfred, while Emily provides commentary about the production of the movie.

Title: Chris Delamo - Red Pilled Cuban-American Voting for Trump
Date: 2016-11-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=t8YYxpoUhqs
Description: This show was recorded November 2nd.

Chris Delamo is a Cuban-American living in Miami who makes videos like vlogs, social experiments, random interviews, debates, and more. His Youtube channel, Red Pill Philosophy, covers a variety of subjects, ranging from politics to science.

We begin by discussing the 2016 election. Chris tells us that, thanks to Donald Trump, this is the first time in his life in which he has felt truly patriotic. We consider the possibility of Trump being a puppet, but agree that it’s quite unlikely. Trump’s penchant for speaking from the heart – on controversial subjects, no less – smacks of authenticity. Chris explains that Trump’s taboo antics hold a deeper significance, for they challenge the politically correct status quo – something that no mainstream politician has done in decades. We then discuss the word “racist.” Chris explains that most people could be considered “racist” because it’s natural to care about those who are genetically close to us, such as our family. However, Chris notes that there is a massive double-standard at play; for what is considered healthy and normal for non-Whites is often considered racist for White people. The show also covers voter fraud, the intentions of our hostile elite, and how Trump’s egotism motivates him to do good.

Title: Kevin Alfred Strom - National Alliance: Evolutionary Diversity & Cosmotheism
Date: 2016-11-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=IQGiXXrjFcY
Description: Kevin was born in 1956 in Anchorage, Alaska, to son third-generation Norwegian-American parents. He worked with William L. Pierce, Richard Cotten, and Revilo Oliver beginning in the early 1980s, producing hundreds of radio, audio and video programs, thousands of essays, and numerous articles, books, periodicals and anthologies. Kevin is the editor of National Vanguard magazine and has played an active role in both iterations of the National Alliance.

The show begins with Kevin telling us how he came to be involved with White Nationalism. We learn that he became disillusioned with multiculturalism and political correctness when he was 12-years-old. Henrik then asks Kevin to outline his worldview. Kevin tells us that everything in the universe is constantly evolving; as such, our goal is to ensure that our race evolves upwards, not downwards. He continues, explaining that there is a deliberate attempt to destroy our race, and that our traditional morals have been inverted to further this nefarious end. We also cover Jewish influence, which Kevin argues is the source of our current plight, and the role of Donald Trump in the ongoing struggle to preserve the West. The first hour concludes with discussion on the National Alliance and how the Federal government has attempted to derail White Nationalist organizations in the past.

The members’ hour begins with consideration of the uniqueness of the European race. We then discuss how anti-White propaganda and rhetoric fuels the Alt-Right. We discuss the ongoing, third world invasion of the West. Kevin predicts that this system won’t last, and as society continues to break down, more and more people will begin wondering what went wrong. We then consider whether or not we will be able to find salvation through the ballot. Kevin argues that we will not find any serious change through the political system, as White births are already the minority. In light of this, he believes that revolution or secession are the only options. The members’ hour also touches on the illusory benefits of multiculturalism and the importance of withdrawing from the system as much as possible.

Title: Ryan Landry - Weimerica: History Rhymes
Date: 2016-11-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vO2x-qq1FKw
Description: Ryan Landry is a Midwestern family man born and raised in New England. When not working in the financial realm, he maintains the blog 28Sherman and writes every Sunday at Social Matter. His podcast Weimerica Weekly is hosted by Social Matter as well.

We begin by discussing Weimerica Weekly. Ryan tells us that he was inspired to create the podcast after noticing the striking similarities between contemporary America and the Weimar Republic. In his words, history doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme. Ironically, many of the things modern liberals consider “progressive” – such as bizarre sexual fetishes – were actually commonplace in Weimar Germany nearly a century ago. We then delve into the similarities and differences between the Weimar Republic and Weimerica. Ryan explains that technological improvements have led to apps such as Tinder and Grindr, which in turn have allowed us to reach levels of degeneracy that shouldn’t even be possible. In addition, America’s racial diversity has led to the bizarre phenomenon known as “race play” – something that would have been near impossible in the Weimar Republic, which was overwhelmingly White.

In the members’ hour, we shift gears to discuss the invasion of Europe. Ryan reminds that most of these supposed refugees are not, in fact, Syrian. We then consider the effect this invasion is having on the indigenous peoples of Europe. Ryan explains how reading about hundreds of migrants being moved into a Swedish town of only 100 inhabitants reminds him of a Medieval king garrisoning his army in a nearby town. Indeed, his comparison is apt, unfortunately, for our elite is colonizing us with a new population. We discuss France, which Ryan – citing the rich history of French national pride and revolution – believes will be the first country in Europe to revolt against their ruling class. The members’ hour also covers the rise of the Alt-Right, Donald Trump, and the future of America.

Title: Melissa - Modern Women Need to Be Lied To - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-10-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Tb24YQN7COI
Description: Melissa is a wife, mother, and full-time technical writer. She has a keen interest in politics, culture, and philosophy. Melissa created her blog, The New Femininity, to connect with men and women who have chosen to reject the sham that is post-modern society.

We begin by discussing Melissa’s red-pill experience. Initially a moderate, learning about government corruption eventually led her to libertarianism. Now, however, Melissa is a full-blown reactionary and ardent anti-feminist. We discuss the issue of women in the Alt-Right, including how it is generally harder for them to swallow the red-pill. Melissa explains that it’s easy for women to be swept up in feminist thought simply because it’s so pervasive in this day and age. We explore the ongoing war on truth and beauty, with Melissa arguing that our values have been intentionally inverted – right is wrong, wrong is right, and so forth. Melissa notes that left seems to be motivated by envy, and thus hates everything strong, virtuous, and beautiful. The show also considers whether or not feminism has any redeeming qualities, and includes discussion on parenthood, SJW witch hunts, and voter fraud.

Title: Carl Lundstr� Business of Nationalism: Concern for Sweden & Origins of The Pirate Bay
Date: 2016-10-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XBmPbX4MfPk
Description: Businessman Carl Lundström is the grandson of Karl Edvard Lundström, founder of the world's largest crisp bread producer Wasabröd. Carl has founded and financed a number of companies, notably Swedish telecom, internet and co-location provider Rix Telecom. He also financially helped the torrent site The Pirate Bay getting started, something he was prosecuted for years later. In addition, he has been involved with various Nationalist organizations in Sweden.

We begin by discussing Carl’s various endeavors, including his involvement with Swedish politics and The Pirate Bay trial. Carl tells us that The Pirate Bay represented resistance to American cultural hegemony, as Swedish politicians are too subservient to Western powers. We discuss the harmful effects of open borders on European society, and we consider why more people don’t speak out against it. We then outline the various justifications our corrupt leaders offer for mass immigration. Carl argues these justifications are inconsistent and insincere; in reality, they are just excuses to replace us with a more docile, low-information population. The first hour concludes with an exploration of the need for right-wing movements to be not only entertaining and appealing, but also informative. 

In the members’ hour, we discuss the impact mass immigration has had on property and housing in Sweden. Carl argues that there would be less problems now had Swedes prevented their properties from being used to house migrants. We touch on the role of the media in the ongoing invasion of Europe, with Carl telling us that the pro-refugee propaganda was targeted at prospective immigrants to make Europe seem very appealing. We discuss how these supposed refugees bring with them the very conditions which they flee, and how this process spells the end of Sweden as a safe, high-trust society. The members’ hour also covers the motivations of the elite, terrorism, and the need for idealists to take action.

Title: Clare - The Truth About South Africa's Rainbow Nation - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-10-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Rl2eAwVodcY
Description: Clare is a lawyer from South Africa, who works for a geographical information systems firm.

We begin by discussing Clare’s background and upbringing. Having grown up during apartheid, Clare witnessed firsthand the dramatic effects that followed its abolition. She tells us that the stories of White-on-black violence during apartheid are largely exaggerated, and that most violence in South Africa was, and continues to be, black-on-black. Clare describes how her misgivings with multiculturalism and equality began once she realized that affirmative action was something indefinite, rather than temporary. We discuss how an unofficial apartheid continues to exist in South Africa; in fact, racial integration only occurs through direct government interference. This, of course, reveals an important truth: people prefer being around their own kind. Shifting gears, Clare tell us what it’s like to be White in contemporary South Africa. We learn that, although nearly all Whites are affected, they are afraid to speak out and be labeled “racists” – for such an accusation, as in other White countries, will generally spell the end of one’s career. The show also touches on early South African history, racial differences, and the state of White identity in this troubled nation.

Title: Seth Cooper & Erik Yount - The Glorious Path: Master vs. Slave Morality - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-10-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=EQKWvgzDi40
Description: Seth Cooper, a lifelong devotee of fantasy and mythology, graduated Summa Cum Laude from Mount Saint Mary’s University, having earned a philosophy degree in 2001. He lives by himself in the rural Northern Neck of Virginia where he continues to realize the far-reaching series that begins with The Glorious Path, his debut novel.

Erik Yount received an education at the MD Institute College of Art, going on to work in various realms of video production. He became increasingly disgruntled with the shallowness of mainstream storytelling and created Oerstra Works as a platform to reignite sublime ideals.

We'll discuss Nietzsche parallels in the fantasy novel The Glorious Path and relate it to the modern era, focusing on the main premise, “The Gods Have Fled.” What does this mean for humanity? Seth elaborates on Nietzsche's famous statement, “God is Dead.” 

Seth and Erik lambaste today's highest moral value of pity, now central in our liberal society in contrast to Nietzsche's idea of will to power. We discuss the slave morality of current western society vs master morality of the noble. Ultimately, we discuss re-igniting Nietzsche's goal of bringing forth the Overman.

Title: Tobias Lindberg & Bechir Rabani - Sweden: Minority Rule, Disintegration & Rising Resistance - Hour 1
Date: 2016-10-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2Bw6h1BxDM0
Description: Tobias Lindberg is the creator of Informationskriget.se, a site dedicated to exposing globalism, corruption, and the dangers of multiculturalism. Bechir Rabani is a Syrian non-refugee living in Sweden, who opposes mass immigration and the anti-White agenda.

After a few necessary introductions, we dive into the subject of today’s show: Sweden. We begin with a reflection on the enormous changes this once-idyllic country has experienced. Bechir remarks that, although third world immigration to Sweden has been ongoing for decades, it has drastically increased within the past few years. He also reminds us that most of these supposed “refugees” are not, as the media would have us believe, Syrian, but instead men – not children – from other Middle Eastern countries. We then discuss the rape epidemic in Sweden, with Tobias pointing out that gang rape – a practice not uncommon in contemporary Sweden – was practically unheard of prior to the third world invasion. Moreover, it is virtually only non-Whites who engage in this disgusting, animalistic crime. The first hour also touches on the dynamics of assimilation, the victim mentality, and the need for the more reasonable immigrants in Sweden to speak out against Cultural Marxism.

The members’ hour begins with a consideration of the Swedish Democrats. Despite being preferable to other Swedish political parties, the Swedish Democrats are notorious for purging members who stray too far from the politically correct. Further disappointing is the fact that the Swedish Democrats focus on Islam, while consistently failing to condemn Jewish influence or Zionism. We then discuss the pathological altruism in Sweden, with Bechir noting that Swedes have become too nice to see the threat posed by non-White immigrants. Switching gears, we mull over our options: revolution or war, as most Swedes are likely to pretend everything is fine until the situation can no longer be ignored. On the subject of leadership, Bechir remains somewhat dubious, as he thinks most leaders can be bought, bribed, or intimidated; Henrik, on the other hand, remains hopeful for the appearance of a virtuous leader. The members’ hour concludes with a discussion on the importance unity and retaining the moral high ground.

Title: Jay Dyer - Hillary Clinton as President: Disaster for US-Russia Relations & the War in Syria
Date: 2016-10-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=QTwmBUOQ8ro
Description: Jay Dyer is a public speaker, lecturer, comedian and author of Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film, as well as the host of the JaysAnalysis Podcast/Esoteric Hollywood. He is also a regular contributor to 21stCenturyWire, Soul of the East and the Espionage History Archive. Jay's work covers a wide variety of subjects, including metaphysics, film analysis, theology, geopolitics, literature, and history.

The show begins with a discussion on the geopolitical quagmire that is Syria. Jay tells us that the American establishment has wanted Bashar al-Assad gone for some time; as such, allegations of chemical weapons use and human rights violations are nothing more than psyops. We then discuss how Russia, over the course of the 20th century, was ravaged by Communism and later plundered by the Clinton administration’s cronies in the 90s. Jay mentions that he doesn’t think a cataclysmic world war will erupt anytime soon but that we will instead see more regional conflicts similar to Syria. On the subject of Syria, Jay argues that most of these supposed jihadists are, in actuality, little more than mercenaries lured in by the promise of food and pay. The first hour also touches on the possibility of a globalist fifth column existing within Russia, fake ISIS propaganda, and the relationship between Evangelicalism and Zionism.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing how Trump, through being unapologetic, represents a break from the politically correct status quo. Jay also points out that Trump has effectively revealed the mechanisms of the New World Order: mass immigration, free trade, and neoconservative wars. We then shift gears to consider how the Clintons fit into the globalist power structure, with Jay arguing that they are simply part of a greater web of corruption. Jay then outlines how the Clintons have operated in a manner common to globalists, namely by creating a foundation to serve as a cover for the trafficking of arms, weapons, and money. We discuss how, in the past, psychological warfare has been often used against foreign countries; today, however, it is primarily wielded by Western governments against their citizens. The members’ hour also explores Milo's antics, how to spread the Alt Right message, and the power of humor.

Title: Ricky Vaughn - Banned from Twitter
Date: 2016-10-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1qkwZn16Gfw
Description: Ricky Vaughn is an Alt Right pundit known primarily for his Twitter trolling and commentary. Prior to a recent ban, Ricky’s Twitter account was so prolific that MIT named him as the 107th most influential entity in the 2016 election. Due to Hurricane Matthew forcing Henrik and Lana to evacuate from Red Ice HQ, Reinhard Wolff sits in this show as a guest host.

We begin by reflecting on Ricky’s recent Twitter ban. He tells us that the ban came without warning and that, despite a pending appeal, he doesn’t think that his account will be reinstated. Ricky then describes how he came to be such a powerful Twitter presence, which includes a brief summary of his red-pill experience. We discuss how he intends to spread the Alt Right without the aid of Twitter; Ricky tells us that he is in the process of making a website, in addition to being on Facebook and gab. We then consider the upcoming election, and how its results will have an enormous impact on the future of free speech in America. The show concludes with a discussion on how the Alt Right narrative can be spread beyond the internet.

Title: Kevin MacDonald - The Alt-Right, Free Speech & Israel’s role in the Migrant Invasion
Date: 2016-10-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=J_EIbEKxASY
Description: Dr. Kevin MacDonald has a Ph.D. in Biobehavioral Sciences and is an expert on Jewish influence and identity. He is also the editor and chief contributor of The Occidental Observer, an online publication that focuses on White identity, White interests, and the culture of the West.

We begin by discussing the current state of the Alt Right. Kevin remarks that it’s very heartening to see so many young folks interested in preserving Western Civilization. We consider the attempts of the media to tie the recent NPI press conference to Donald Trump, with Kevin noting that accusations of racism had little effect in the primaries. In light of this, we consider whether the power of the word “racist” is waning due to overuse. We discuss the complex meme culture that has developed in the Alt Right; Dr. MacDonald clarifies that he does, in fact, appreciate the more humorous side to our movement. Shifting gears, Kevin tells us about his attempts to put pro-White ads in college newspapers. Despite priding itself as a bastion of free speech, the University of Chicago ultimately denied the ads. The first hour also features discussion on private censorship, IsraAID aiding refugees in Greece and the rape epidemic in Europe.

In the members’ hour, we discuss the fact that multiculturalism has become a moral imperative, and that to even question immigration is tantamount to heresy in the current year. Kevin reminds us that Europeans are, in fact, very moral people; as such, it’s hard to convince White people to do something if it isn’t morally justified. Unfortunately, this emphasis on morality has been turned against us, as our ruling elite has led us to believe that handing over our nations to outsiders is the right thing to do. Dr. MacDonald traces this back to hunter-gatherer culture in northern Europe, wherein one had to maintain a positive reputation to avoid exile. Later, we comment on California governor Jerry Brown who just signed an anti-BDS bill into law, coming one step closer to outlawing criticism of Israel. We then touch on immigration, with Kevin explaining that living as a minority in a foreign land will invariably lead to feelings of isolation and discontent. We also discuss how the Left, hell-bent on enforcing multiculturalism, continues to argue that we must be nice to Muslim immigrants lest they turn into terrorists. The show concludes with a reflection on subversion within nationalist movements, and what we can do to safeguard the Alt Right.

Title: Daniel Hammarberg - "The New Country": Censorship & Population Replacement
Date: 2016-10-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=jpk1UB59LJs
Description: Daniel Hammarberg is a native Swede who has written many articles on current events and social issues. He has also worked with the anti-pedophile movement Nätverket Stoppa Pedofilerna, publicizing the identities, crimes and physical whereabouts of convicted child molesters – information that Swedish authorities keep hidden. When he is not writing or engaged in activism, Daniel enjoys sea swimming and powerlifting.

To begin, Daniel tells us about his online work exposing the identities of pedophiles. Despite the fact that it is quite easy to obtain information about people in Sweden, pedophiles have their identities protected by the government. We discuss The Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Rights, an organization that has been relentlessly pushing gay culture on children. Daniel remarks that society pretends homosexuals are an oppressed victim group; the reality, however, is that they are treated like royalty. We also consider Jewish influence, Holocaust indoctrination, and the outrage over Donald Trump Junior’s recent gas chamber comment.

In the members’ hour, we discuss the Left’s ongoing efforts to create a new Sweden. According to Daniel, most of the multicultural propaganda in Sweden is little more than a declaration of war against ethnic Swedes and traditional values. We then examine how equality has been weaponized to dissolve the cultural foundation of not only Sweden, but the West overall. We discuss feminism, masculinity, and how the Swedish media tends to portray men in a negative light; this only further harms gender relations. Later, Henrik notes that the new man – that is, the Left’s vision of a new type of human – will be nothing more than a mindless slave on a global plantation, ruled over by a hostile elite. We wrap up with a discussion on the future of Sweden and what must be done to preserve the West.

Title: Paul Kersey - Diversity in America: The Death of the Space Program
Date: 2016-09-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=OJDZq-rlyTI
Description: Paul Kersey is the author of the blog Stuff Black People Don't Like, and has published many books on race, multiculturalism, and society, including SBPDL Year One, Hollywood in Blackface, Escape From Detroit, and Whitey on the Moon: Race and the Death of NASA.

We begin by considering how profoundly captivating White America finds spectator sports. Paul argues that, above all else, watching professional sports provides them with a sense of identity, seeing as how they cannot have one based on their heritage. We then talk about the recent outrage over black athletes refusing to stand for the pledge of allegiance; Paul explains that White Americans have not yet realized that the American flag no longer represents their interests, but rather their demise. Later, we discuss Detroit, Selma, and other once-great cities that now lie in ruins after undergoing dramatic demographic shifts. The show also includes a consideration of the American space program, which, as Paul states, is indicative of the heights Whites can reach when they aren’t riddled with guilt and obsessed with equality. We conclude by giving Paul a chance to tell us about his upcoming work.

Description: StyxHexenHammer666 and Reinhard Wolff join us to discuss the esoteric and synchromystic expressions of Pepe / Kek. Ever since Hillary Clinton attacked Pepe and then fell ill on 9/11, an occult power behind the meme magic of the Alt-Right has begun to show itself.

Description: Henrik & Lana expose IsraAID, an Israeli NGO that is helping migrant boats reach Europe's shores by waving them in and giving them instructions on where to go. Meanwhile, Israel itself has the lowest refugee admittance rate of any country in the world. Why won't they help Palestinians or take in these migrants from Syria, the Middle East and North Africa themselves?

Title: Bart & Michael - Erkenbrand: The Alt-Right in the Netherlands
Date: 2016-09-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5mmwZUN9-rk
Description: Dutch Alt-Right activists Bart and Michael have taken the initiative to set up regular meetups in the Netherlands people concerned with the future of Europe. Their first conference, Erkenbrand, will take place in Rotterdam at the end of September and include guests such as Millennial Woes and Roger Devlin.

We begin with a few necessary introductions, including a brief mention of the upcoming Erkenbrand conference in Holland. We then delve into the ongoing demographic crisis in the West. Although this topic is certainly commonplace within the Alt-Right, there has been very little coverage on the how it has affected Holland in particular. Thankfully, Bart and Michael are more than willing to fill us in. We learn that Holland, much like the rest of the West, is being flooded with non-European immigrants. Major cities like Amsterdam are already nearly half non-Dutch; the countryside, unfortunately, is beginning to undergo a similar transformation. We also discuss Geert Wilders, the establishment right, and whether or not we will be able to save our countries through the political process.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the vital role that networking plays within our movement. We consider the fact that many aspects of Western culture – history, myths, art, etc. – are currently being altered or, in some cases, blatantly removed for political reasons. Bart and Michael then tell us more about Amsterdam. Thanks to 100 years of socialist rule, the Netherlands’ capital has become overrun with prostitution, drugs, and crime. We also discuss how liberalism’s promotion of tolerance has effectively created a culture of indifference, in which people now consider it moral to allow immorality. The show concludes with a consideration of the steps that need to be taken to preserve the West.

Title: Tacitus, Aristocles, Tharru & Titus - KulturKampf
Date: 2016-09-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=InUZRTIERn0
Description: KulturKampf is a podcast on The Right Stuff Radio hosted by Titus Flavius, Tharru Larbi, Aristocles, and Gaius Tacitus. Primarily focused on philosophy, KulturKampf was created to rekindle interest in the Western tradition and utilize the wisdom of our forebears in the contemporary culture war.

To begin, Titus Flavius outlines the origins of KulturKampf. We learn that the podcast was born out of a desire to focus on timeless concepts rather than day-to-day politics. We discuss Plato’s Republic and what it has to offer the Alt Right. Titus describes how, in Book IV, Plato offers a convincing argument for hierarchy within a society. The KulturKampf hosts then talk about their victory over a group of Marxists in a recent debate. This brings us to a discussion on the unfortunate prevalence of Marxism among Western college students. We conclude the first hour by considering the modern Left, and how radical ideologies are rarely able to achieve hegemony.

In the members’ hour, we delve into the reasons why the West is facing its current plight. Tharru cites the importance of studying philosophy, and Aristocles argues that we need a firm understanding of technology as well. We consider the importance of aesthetics, and how many people respond more strongly to beauty than to facts. Gaius Tacitus notes that modern society lacks beauty, and that the pursuit thereof played a part in bringing him to the Alt Right. We also discuss how our current struggle offers the chance for people to become stronger, due to the immense challenge that it presents. The show concludes with the KulturKampf hosts offering their thoughts on the future of not only the Alt Right, but Western Civilization in general.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=brH1lT1t1Jk
Description: Jazzhands McFeels is the host of Fash the Nation, a popular Alt Right podcast.

To begin, Jazzhands explains how he acquired such a unique pseudonym. We contemplate the future of Fash the Nation; although it has been primarily focused on the 2016 election, Jazzhands tells us that the podcast is here to stay – regardless of who wins in November. We then switch gears to discuss Hillary’s health, with Jazzhands shedding some light on the political ramifications of a nominated presidential candidate dying during the election. Jazzhands also briefly describes his red-pill process, which brought him from mainstream conservatism to American Renaissance and, eventually, The Right Stuff. We talk about Milo and what has been dubbed the “Alt Light” – that is, the watered down, civic nationalist version of the Alt Right. Naturally, that brings us the rather taboo subject of Jewish influence and subversion; Jazzhands notes that Jews – and, in particular, Jewish organizations – overwhelmingly oppose White interests. We conclude the show by considering the future of America and our dire need for an ethno-state.

Title: Frank Raymond - The Caucasian Mind: Both Universe-Oriented & Self-Oriented
Date: 2016-09-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ntosk72rQOw
Description: Frank Raymond was born in the Indian subcontinent and spent his early life in Calcutta, Darjeeling, and Dhaka. He attended university in England and later returned to Bangladesh, where he spent many years running an industrial business and immersing himself in the mind and culture of the people of India. For the past 20+ years Raymond has resided in Vancouver, BC, and due to witnessing the slow destruction of the once-proud Canada, he was inspired to write his first book, Sweet Dreams and Terror Cells.

Our show begins with a consideration of the ways in which ethnic Europeans differ from other peoples. Since Frank is of Indian heritage, he is able to enjoy an outside perspective on the matter. For example, he points out that many activities, such as geocaching and dog shows, seem to be unique to White people. Frank argues that non-Whites are mostly concerned with biological needs, whereas Europeans have historically tended towards participating in activities that offer no immediate, biological gratification. We then discuss how societies created by White people tend to be lacking in corruption and nepotism, with exception to the hostile foreign elites at the top. The first hour is concluded with a rather ominous rumination on the future of a world without Europeans.

We begin the members’ hour by discussing Frank’s homeland, India. Frank tells us that there is an unfortunate culture of humiliation in India. For example, it is quite common for a daughter-in-law to be thoroughly dominated and humiliated by her mother-in-law. Frank also discusses the prevalence of rioting and violent protesting in non-White parts of the world. With regard to immigration, Frank correctly argues that you cannot fully judge a foreign group when they are an overwhelming minority; this is because, when surrounded by White people and standards, immigrants will be forced to assimilate. Only when immigrants have their own communities will their true culture and behavior find expression. To conclude, Frank reminds us that contemporary White people, similarly, are not expressing their true nature since they have been subjected to cultural brainwashing at the hands of a hostile and largely foreign elite.

Title: Ricardo Duchesne - Faustian Man in a Multicultural Age - Hour 1
Date: 2016-09-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5wXilCXAz6Y
Description: Ricardo Duchesne teaches sociology and world history at The University of New Brunswick in Saint John, Canada. His Dissertation, "All Contraries Confounded: Historical Materialism and the Transition-to-Capitalism Debate", was awarded the "Doctoral Prize Award" for best dissertation of the year. Ricardo is also the author of The Uniqueness of Western Civilization and Faustian Man in a Multicultural Age.

To begin, Ricardo details how his research led him to the rather taboo conclusion that race is an extremely significant factor in both creating and maintaining civilizations. After realizing that civilizations tend to decline when they undergo racial demographic shifts, Ricardo started to understand that the West simply cannot survive without a White majority. We discuss how such demographic shifts can have profound effects on societies, as numerous institutions, such as the free market and the separation of church and state, are things that, for the most part, only ethnic Europeans value. The first hour concludes with a discussion of the attempts within academia to deconstruct the validity of race and downplay the uniqueness of the West.

In the members’ hour, Ricardo tells us about his upcoming book, Faustian Man in a Multicultural Age. He argues that the true spirit of the West is Faustian, meaning exploration, discovery, and a desire to penetrate the unknown are the defining aspects of the European soul. We consider the fact that those who seek to control and domesticate humanity, reducing them to the level of consumers and zombies, see this Faustian nature as dangerous and unpredictable. Ricardo notes that Donald Trump, through his tendency to push limits and take risks, in many ways embodies the Faustian ideal. To wrap up, Ricardo recounts his experience working in academia, and extends an invitation to any prospective scholars to come to Canada and do graduate work under his tutelage.

Title: Alfred & Monika Schaefer - Ritual Defamation of Violinist & German Police Raid Thought Criminal
Date: 2016-09-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=CLGJJF9tssA
Description: Monika Schaefer is a National Park Warden, professional violinist, and life-long environmental activist. She was formerly involved with The Green Party of Canada and was a candidate in four elections. Monika has been an active community member in her small town of Jasper, not only as an activist but also as a musician, donating her music on countless occasions. After making a video challenging the official Holocaust narrative, Monika found herself the victim of ritual defamation, a process through which an individual is subjected to intense social pressure and stigmatization.

Alfred Schaefer is a German producer with several YouTube videos aimed at exposing the brainwashing, lies and control words that are used to subject entire populations to the Zionist agenda. His video, “Brainwashing: 9/11 & the Holohoax,” outlines how the Jewish Western elite have managed to perpetrate a massive deception through manipulation of the mainstream media and political leaders.

We begin by giving Monika a chance to explain her journey. While she began by looking into 9/11 Truth, she would later discover WW2 revisionism. Monika was able to overcome her initial apprehension and delve into the subject long enough to realize that the official Holocaust narrative amounts to little more than post-war propaganda. This eventually led her to creating a video in which she apologized to her deceased German mother, whom, many years ago, she had chastised for not trying to stop the alleged genocide. Due to challenging the idea that six million Jews died in German extermination camps, Monika quickly found herself victim of ritual defamation. Alfred also shares the story of his house being raided by German police for thought crime. We conclude the first hour by discussing the nature of the migrant crisis, groupthink, and how necessary it is to question the official World War II narrative.

In the members’ hour, we consider the fact that celebrities, such as Mel Gibson, oftentimes express controversial views, only to later recant; this has the effect of intimidating the “average” person into keeping quiet. We discuss the control words – racist, Nazi, bigot, etc. – that prevent people from discussing vital issues. Monika then outlines a few elements of ritual defamation, including the attempt to involve the victim’s family in the defamation process. We also discuss the fact that our hostile ruling elite are lecturing us about the alleged Holocaust of Jews while actively engineering our destruction. Alfred concludes the show by imploring us to stop using the language of our enemy; instead of Nazi, we should say human, for this buzzword is nothing more than a form of mind control used prevent ethnic Europeans from enjoying what all peoples need: self-determination.

Title: Kalki Weisthor - German Occult Revival - Hour 1
Date: 2016-09-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PUaRpy-0HqQ
Description: Kalki Weisthor AKA Bob Weisthor is an Armanist, a Wotanist and a student of the Vedas, a seeker of historical truth, and an advocate of deep ecology, who lives in the Southern United States. He is the proprietor of KalkiWeisthor.net, and advocates spiritual Awakening of Aryan man as necessary for the survival of his people and of World Civilization. He is a former attorney and a former Buddhist whose inspirations include Miguel Serrano and Savitri Devi.

To begin, Kalki tells us the meaning behind his pseudonym. We learn that Kalki is name of the 10th avatar of Vishnu, while Weisthor was the alias of infamous SS-Brigadeführer and occultist Karl Maria Wiligut. We then dive into World War II and the controversial nature of revisionism, with Kalki pointing out that, despite claiming many more lives, Communism is still not anywhere near as taboo as National Socialism. We discuss how the conclusion of World War II was a watershed moment, with a new order being established thereafter. Next, Kalki recounts his spiritual journey. Although a Buddhist for many years, Kalki eventually had a spiritual experience which led him to Germanic Paganism. WWe then examine influential thinkers involved with what is sometimes referred to as Esoteric Hitlerism, including Savitri Devi and Miguel Serrano.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the importance of identity, and how it is necessary for civilization. On the subject of morality, Kalki explains that he is not a dualist; in other words, he doesn’t believe in a cosmic struggle between good and evil. Instead, he sees both creation and destruction as necessary forces in the universe. However, Kalki argues that we are part of the creative force, and it is our job to oppose the forces of destruction that threaten our existence. We also discuss the Indo-European traditions, Adolf Hitler, and the prophecy of “the coming man.” In conclusion, Kalki challenges us to pursue spiritual practice and embrace conflict in order to grow into stronger, wiser beings.

Title: Matt Flavel - Asatru: Native Spirituality of European Folk - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-09-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=4JZA0RWF640
Description: Matt Flavel serves on the board of directors for the Asatru Folk Assembly.

We begin with a preliminary consideration of Asatru. As Matt explains, Asatru is an ancient religion that was revived during the 70s. Matt tells us about his spiritual journey, which, interestingly enough, began with the Jehovah’s Witnesses. We then discuss the ancient Germanic world and dispel the misconception that it was simple and barbaric. We also discuss the folkish nature of Asatru, and how this integral aspect of the Germanic tradition has been lost among an unfortunate amount of modern Pagans. Matt touches on the activities that Asatruar participate in, ranging from celebratory festivals to local meetups. We also touch on the importance of identity; specifically, the fact that White people are the only group expected to not have one. More abstract, metaphysical topics are touched on as well, such as the order-chaos dichotomy that is integral to Asatru. The show concludes with Matt stressing that Asatru, despite boasting ancient origins, is a modern religion for modern people.

Title: Ethan Ralph - The Alt-Right Doesn't Virtue Signal or Denounce 'Extremists' - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-09-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=IcuHdYc_7Nc
Description: Ethan Ralph is the Owner and Editor-in-Chief of The Ralph Retort.

We begin by discussing Ethan’s ideological journey. Originally a leftist, he eventually became disillusioned with liberalism and left the Democratic Party. Ethan was later involved in Gamergate, wherein he came face to face with not only social justice warriors, but also the duplicitous nature of the mainstream media. We then talk about the recent media uproar about the alt-right, and question whether or not Breitbart can truly be considered alt-right. Ethan observes that, despite the stereotypes about the alt-right, it offers more room for differing views than the modern left, which has taken on puritanical levels of thought policing. We briefly touch on the Olympics, and how this once respectable competition has been reduced to a fragment of its former glory. We conclude by discussing the harmful effects of multiculturalism, diversity, and monoculture.

Title: Judgy Bitch - Feminism, The Alt-Right & White Genocide - Hour 1
Date: 2016-08-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=SGlZq2HktQs
Description: Judgy Bitch (also known as Janet Bloomfield) has an undergraduate degree in Film Theory, a Master’s degree in Business Administration and she has recently been admitted to a PhD program in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, but she is not sure she wants to go just yet. She is a full time mother to her three children and a full time wife to her husband. Her children have never seen the inside of a daycare center and her husband has never made his own sandwich, and that makes her very happy.

A filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members.

We begin by discussing how Janet came to realize the insidious nature of feminism, to which she was first exposed while studying Film Theory. Having grown up on a farm with multiple brothers, Janet found herself unable to accept the notion that women are oppressed. However, her disdain for feminism didn’t fully sink in until she had a son; it was only then that she began truly questioning the experience of men in contemporary society. We also discuss how unfairly the institution of patriarchy has been maligned, despite the fact women are safest when in monogamous, heterosexual relationships. We wrap up the first hour by considering how we can heal the schism that feminism has sown between the sexes.

In the members’ hour, we switch gears to delve a number into broader cultural and political issues. We discuss the alt-right, including Hillary’s amusing speech. Janet expresses that she doesn’t think the alt-right is necessarily “racist” or “anti-Semitic”, and that most of the antics within the alt-right that could be described as such amount to nothing more than trolling. We talk about Trump, with Janet observing that people are tired of getting duped by mainstream politicians and are thus thrilled to finally have a third option. We also consider White Genocide and the urgent need for European nations to stick together. Our conversation concludes with some musings on the necessity of competition, on both an individual and also a group level.

Title: Dr. Bill Warner - The True History of Muslim Conquests - Hour 1
Date: 2016-08-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=zMwcX_vU1lM
Description: Bill Warner holds a PhD in physics and math, NC State University, 1968. He has been a university professor, businessman, and applied physicist. Dr. Warner founded the Center for the Study of Political Islam (CSPI) and is its director. He has produced a dozen books, including a Koran, a biography of Mohammed and a summary of the political traditions of Mohammed. He also developed the first self-study course on Political Islam. He has given talks nationally and internationally about Islamic political doctrine.

We begin by diving headfirst into the history of Islam. Bill differentiates between the historical Muhammad and the Muhammad of the Quran. Unbeknownst to many, Muhammad spent much of his life as a politician and jihadist, and was involved in many assassinations. Bill reminds us that jihad is not only of the sword, but also of of the tongue and pen – meaning that Islam’s war against the West is being waged on the cultural/political level as well. We also detail the process by which Islam subjugates non-Muslims after they have been conquered.

In the members’ hour, we discuss Islam’s historical intolerance of other religions and cultures. Bill reminds us that much of the Middle East and North Africa were Christian prior to the spread of Islam, and that the crusades were in reality a reaction to this encroachment. We also touch upon the myth of the Islamic “Golden Age.” We then shift the conversation toward more contemporary issues, such as the current threat Islam poses to the West and how political correctness prevents people from discussing this pressing issue. In conclusion, Bill argues that people need to simply tell the truth about Islam and stop worrying about being called “racists” or “Islamophobes.”

Title: Samuel Finlay - The US Military is the Enforcer of Globalism - Hour 1
Date: 2016-08-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=cgx_tNsqcns
Description: This show was first released August 17, 2016 on https://redice.tv

Samuel Finlay was born and raised in Oklahoma and served as an infantryman in Bosnia and Afghanistan, and later earned a Master’s Degree in International Studies. He is the author of Breakfast with the Dirt Cult, a novelized account of his experiences in love and war.

The show begins with Sam talking about his time in the military. Sam explains that he joined because he thought it would make a man out of him. While he hated the military at first, mostly due to its bureaucratic nature, Sam eventually found himself in a good platoon and grew to certain appreciate aspects of military service. We then discuss his time in Afghanistan. Sam tells us that his platoon was honorable and only wanted to defeat the Taliban; in other words, their intentions were just. However, as time went on, he began to harbor serious doubts about the war. Sam eventually came to the realization that America is being controlled by a hostile, ruling elite that views the military as nothing more than a tool for their globalist agenda.

In the members’ hour, we begin by discussing the role veterans in the Alt Right. Sam informs us that while some veterans still see America as a shining beacon of freedom and liberty, many others, such as Sam, are thoroughly disillusioned with what America has become. We discuss the fact that loving a country that hates you isn’t patriotism, but servitude. Sam then shares with us the intense cultural divide he observed between Americans and Afghans, and how progressives don’t truly respect other cultures, but instead want to make everyone like them. This fanatical need to change the world, as Sam correctly points out, it is a key part of the liberal agenda. We wrap up with a discussion on how modernity tames people and thereby denies them many deeply gratifying – and oftentimes primal – experiences.

Title: Patrick Le Brun - European Terror Wave & Disarray in the Democratic Party - Hour 1
Date: 2016-08-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=rgLroUAzbHM
Description: This show was first released August 8, 2016 on https://redice.tv

Patrick Le Brun is a writer and activist who has written many articles for Counter-Currents. He has extensive experience with the French Identitarian movement and is currently based in the United States, where he mentors college students who wish to engage in activism.

In the first hour, we begin by discussing the importance of independent media. Patrick stresses the fact that mainstream media outlets present a very limited or distorted perspective on current events. In light of this, Patrick urges listeners to continue supporting sites such as Red Ice and Counter-Currents. We then delve into the topic of radical Islam. Patrick outlines what the Western ruling elite considers to be a “good” Muslim: namely, one who bows to American hegemony and offers up their oil. This is why America has made enemies of secular leaders such as Saddam Hussein and Bashar al-Assad – all while maintaining intimate relations with the highly oppressive Saudi regime. We then discuss how Islamic extremism has transformed from simply consisting of insurgent armies to now encompassing individual, open-source terrorism. We conclude the first hour by mulling over the ineffective responses to Islamic terrorism that are so unfortunately common in the West.

In the member’s segment, we consider both the Democratic National Convention and the current election overall. We begin by discussing the DNC email leaks, with Patrick noting that the whole affair reveals the media to be fairly subservient to the Democratic party. Patrick also states that the Democratic party is very aware of the criticism leveled against them; as such, they have become adept at shaping public perception while nevertheless retaining their oligarchical core. Having actually attended the DNC, Patrick shares some interesting stories about his experience there, such as the massive walk out and an occupation of a media tent. As Patrick observes, American mainstream media glossed over these events, while international and independent media outlets actually covered them. Patrick also reinforces the idea that the main paradigm of our age is not left vs right, but rather globalism vs identity (nationalism). Finally, we wrap up by discussing the left’s plan to destroy Trump by trotting out disgruntled former employees, and how an October surprise revealing Hillary’s role in the creation of ISIS would prove immensely beneficial to Trump.

Description: This show was first released August 5, 2016 on https://redice.tv

Richard Spencer is President of The National Policy Institute and Editor of Washington Summit Publishers, Radix Journal, and RadixJournal.com. He was also formerly an Assistant Editor at The American Conservative magazine and Executive Editor of Taki's Magazine. Richard attended University of Virginia, University of Chicago, and was a doctoral student at Duke University before dropping out to pursue a life of thought-crime. As a result, he was arrested in Hungary at the behest of Viktor Orban and, more recently, has been formally banned from the United Kingdom.

A filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members: 
http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/extra/program.php?id=1155

We begin by discussing a private NPI conference in Detroit that Richard recently attended. This event boasted at least 60 members, with most of the attendees being around thirty-years old. Richard expresses both satisfaction and surprise at the ideological unity he encountered among the event’s attendees. We then briefly ruminate on how people wind up in the Alt Right. Richard restates his oft-repeated – and entirely correct – observation that people are being red-pilled by life; in other words, the harsh reality of our rapidly degenerating society is forcing many people to reach uncomfortable conclusions about the nature of multiculturalism, liberalism, and the future of ethnic Europeans worldwide. As such, Richard advises that, in order to be successful, those in the Alt Right need only continue doing what they’re already doing.

Next, we touch on Donald Trump and how his campaign affects the Alt Right. Richard shares some valuable insights into the relationship between vanguard and populist movements. As Richard notes, the former generally cannot expect to gain support from the masses in the way that the latter can. In light of this, the goal of vanguard movements, such as the Alt Right, is to continually shape the metapolitical sphere in its image. Richard reminds us that the Alt Right needs to be bigger than Trump – it needs to offer a more comprehensive worldview for those ready to accept it. We then touch on the possibility of a Trump victory permanently reshaping the American political realm and whether or not mainstream Conservatives will remain loyal to the Republican Party.

Later, we talk about Richard’s recent, lifelong ban from the United Kingdom issued by none other than unelected Prime Minister Theresa May. Richard relates this to Carl Schmitt's astute observation that the preservation of liberalism, quite paradoxically, often requires some very illiberal measures to be taken. He then shares his thoughts on the collapse of Western Civilization; namely, that it has already collapsed. We also discuss Richard’s eventful trip to the Republican National Convention – an event which, according to Richard, had a notable Alt Right presence. The show concludes with a brief mention of The National Policy Institute’s upcoming conference in November, which the Red Ice team will most certainly be attending.

Title: StateOfNation - Nationalism: Keeping It Simple - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-08-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=AddTabLnW4Q
Description: StateOfNation is a 24-year-old British man living in Italy who produces the YouTube channel of the same name. Among his noteworthy videos are “Nationalism in 90 Seconds” and “The Demographic Decline of Britain.”

In this discussion, StateOfNation talks about the great divide of attitudes amongst Italians and Brits regarding the civil unrest that is bubbling out of the multicultural experiment. We address the narrative of White privilege and the reality of race-based aristocracy, and State defines “nation” relative to a self-identified ethnic group. He explains some of the common misconceptions of Nationalism in relation to Western colonialism and White supremacy along with the ideals of cultural relativism. We consider how unrelated issues such as homosexuality, feminism and gender equality are mistakenly intertwined with the concept of Nationalism. We get into the validity of the right/left political paradigm, the liberal side effects of global capitalism, and democracy as a battle of demography. StateOfNation refers to CasaPound Italia’s Identitarian approach to network building and empowering indigenous Italians. Then, we talk about State’s “5 Questions for Progressives” video, which asks why it’s a good idea morally to allow mass immigration to make Whites a minority in their own lands. We also touch on some counterproductive strategies that should not be applied in spreading the Nationalist message, as well as best practices for winning people over through simple humor, positivity and leading by example. Later, State gives his takes on the divided Brexit vote, how racial identity affects political interests, and why analyzing Whiteness is an important for reigniting Europeans’ love for their own culture. Our conversation rounds off with thoughts on the UK’s current political system, the place of Sharia Law courts in England, and the tribalist way of respecting individual communities with unique cultural differences.

Title: Colin Flaherty - The Media is Lying About Black Lives Matter & Black Mob Violence - Hour 1
Date: 2016-08-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=uv3Hj63kxs4
Description: Colin Flaherty is the award winning author of the bestselling books White Girl Bleed a Lot and Don’t Make the Black Kids Angry. His story of how a black man was unjustly convicted of trying to kill his White girl friend resulted in his release from state prison and was featured on NPR, the Los Angeles Times and Court TV.

Colin returns to Red Ice for another discussion about the issues of escalating black mob violence and Black on White racial crime. We begin with a look at some of the recent mainstream headlines that have brought attention to the supposed systemic racism embedded within the largely White European US police force – one of the biggest lies of our current times. We discuss how the controlled media relentlessly hammers away at convoluted stories of black oppression and discrimination while brushing over the truth of the insane hostility and violence that cops and average citizens deal with on a regular basis. Colin underscores the unique way in which Obama not only justifies, but actually encourages vicious hatred and defiance of law enforcement, and we consider how pleas for “unity” and much needed “conversations about race” are merely tactics to cover the root of the problem. Colin also gives plenty of examples of the government’s agenda to drive the numbers of black crime statistics down, including cases of judges rigging the court system and public officials being encouraged to “stand down” and ignore black-on-black crime. Further, we weigh up the insidious aims of the Black Lives Matter movement and the widespread trend of indoctrinating White children to feel guilt and shame for Western culture and the history of slavery. We also look at how blacks are targeting other immigrants in violent crimes and Colin touches on the grim reality of the latest National Crime Victimization Survey.

In the member half, we continue our discussion on the media agenda to paint Whites as oppressive racists, and we ponder the democrat obsession with racial consciousness. Colin gives his take on the militarization of police forces in response to crime waves in larger cities, and he addresses what the call for “better police and community relations” really means considering cops are being discouraged to even defend themselves, such as in the case of July’s Dallas sniper attack. Then, we focus on Europe’s mounting migrant crime epidemic and the resultant cultural destruction that should be ringing the alarm for Americans. Colin stresses how the suicidal behavior of believing the infiltration of hostile invaders is deserved will lead to the complete demise of Western civilization. We get into the problem of Europe aiding and abetting African countries in their quest to infiltrate the most welfare rich Northern European countries, and we also address the rampant sex attacks perpetrated by migrants that have been plaguing Europe and becoming more prevalent in the US. Later, we consider the brain drain that is occurring throughout once prestigious countries like Germany and Sweden as the intelligent indigenous stock makes a break for more friendly opportunities. At the end, we talk about how the US now has radical Islam heaped on top of its collective guilt and Europe is getting its own taste of #BlackLivesMatter.

Title: Germar Rudolf - Persecution of Revisionists & Demographic Disaster
Date: 2016-08-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=4xtdfU6PSBY
Description: Germar Rudolf was born in Limburg, Germany. He studied chemistry at Bonn University, where he graduated in 1989 as a Diplom-Chemist, which is comparable to a U.S. PhD degree. From 1990-1993 he prepared a German PhD thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in conjunction with the University of Stuttgart, Germany. Parallel to this and in his spare time, Rudolf prepared an expert report on chemical and technical questions of the alleged gas chambers of Auschwitz, The Rudolf Report. He is the founder of the small revisionist outlet, Castle Hill Publishers.

Mr. Rudolf joins us to share the story of his life’s work as a revisionist researcher and writer and the ostracizing and persecution he has endured for daring to tread into the controversial topic of the German holocaust. Germar talks about the process of awakening that led him to question the “official” version of holocaust history in his mid-20s, when he stumbled upon the notorious Leuchter Report while preparing an expert report on the chemical and technical questions of the alleged gas chambers of Auschwitz and Birkenau for the trial of a Holocaust “denier.” We discuss the longstanding and brutal suppression of evidences that refute the cherished narrative of gas chambers used to systematically exterminate 6 million Jews, and we look at the undeniable proof that the powers that be have been using this “miracle weapon” to psychologically trounce German and Western European identity. Then, Germar gives a straightforward definition of “revisionist,” underscoring that in the case of the holocaust, the general issues of persecution and unjust treatment of Jews is not denied. He highlights some of the chemical, structural and biological evidence that points to a starkly contrasting story than what has been painted throughout 70+ years of political propagandizing. Germar also touches on the thought crimes that sent him to prison for 44 months and the blatant lawlessness of court proceedings he’s witnessed, and he gives a rundown of his latest book, Resistance is Obligatory.

In the members’ segment, Germar goes deeper into exposing free speech hijacking and human dignity suppression that is at the core of revisionist work. We consider the massive power structure upheaval that would need to occur in order for Western civilization at large to achieve a complete paradigm shift and accept the fact that we have been lied to and manipulated on so many levels concerning WWI/II. We discuss the most critical extinction level crisis that is plaguing Europe – the demographic decline of natives resulting from the shrinking birth rate. Germar emphasizes the financial implications of Europeans allowing themselves to be bred out, and we debate whether or not the government’s (dis)incentivizing having larger families is really the issue. We give some thought to the role of the 1960s sexual revolution, the advent of birth control, and the lost sense awareness that we live in a chain of generations that keeps the social order on course. At the end, we weigh up how the crisis the West is spawning many religious zealots and a rising core of radical traditionalist who may or may not be able to rescue the vanishing European civilization.

Title: Dr. David Duke - Running for Senate
Date: 2016-08-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3YfU0q50d6w
Description: Dr. David Duke is a graduate of Louisiana State University with a BA in History. He pursued a PhD in the largest university in Ukraine and in 2005 completed his Doctoral Defense in Kiev. He is the author of the books “Jewish Supremacism,” “My Awakening” and “The Secret Behind Communism.” Duke, a former member of the House of Representatives from Louisiana, is currently running for US Senate.

There is an audio version available of this interview at redice.tv. Both video segments of this interview is available for Red Ice Members: http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/extra/program.php?id=1159

We begin by briefly touching on Dr. Duke’s return to American politics. He has chosen to run for a number of reasons, including the current awakening taking place among ethnic Europeans in America and the rise of Trump. Duke reminds us that our current plight – namely, that we are being demographically replaced by hostile foreigners – proves that he was correct all along. We then discuss the insanity of modern liberalism and the divisive nature of multiculturalism. Dr. Duke also points out that the egalitarian rhetoric offered by our elite is nothing more than a weapon to destabilize the West and further consolidate power into their hands – as was the case in Communist Russia. We conclude the first hour by talking about the left’s efforts to create a non-White voting bloc, black-on-White violence, and America’s disastrous foreign policy.

In the members hour, we explore the volatile state of race relations in America. Dr. Duke reminds us that, unlike previous threats to the West, our current predicament can be solved peacefully and humanely via the political system. As such, it is of the utmost importance that Dr. Duke is elected.We then discuss the hypocritical nature of identity politics in America. White Europeans, despite being the founding ethnic stock of America, are forbidden from explicitly advocating for their interests; non-Whites, however, are allowed to engage in ruthless ethnic competition without facing any social repercussions. We talk about the fact that supporting Trump – who represents non-White people implicitly, not explicitly – carries such a stigma that many people, such as academics, cannot support him lest they risk ruining their careers. In light of this, Dr. Duke proposes introducing legislation to outlaw discrimination based on political views. Finally, we wrap up by discussion how America has changed for the worse over the past few decades; Dr. Duke, however, remains optimistic that positive change is on its way.

Title: Gilad Atzmon - Turkey’s Failed Coup, Rise of Nationalism & Mammonism
Date: 2016-07-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0DZiaO3H61k
Description: Gilad Atzmon is an Israeli born jazz musician and author that lives and works in England. He is trained in composition and jazz at the Rubin Academy of Music, Jerusalem. He is a member of the Blockheads, founded the Orient House Ensemble in London, and has recorded and performed with many rock music legends. Gilad also writes on political matters, social issues, Jewish identity and culture. Atzmon is the author of The Wandering Who, and A to Zion – The Definitive Israeli Lexicon.

A filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members.
http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/extra/program.php?id=1150

n this episode, Gilad speaks about his understanding of the failed Turkish Coup that followed attempts by Erdogan to reinstate Turkey’s amicable relationship with Russia. Gilad speculates that Turkey is on its way to becoming the new Syria, as it’s on one hand an extremely Nationalist country and on the other at the forefront of the NATO/neocon intervention project. We learn about the uprising and taking to the streets by the Turkish people that stopped the military takeover, which Gilad says has been likened by some to an Islamofascist revolt. Then, we discuss how the Brexit decision relates to a bone of contention for Turkey’s role in the dirty NATO wars and the refugee invasion sprouting out of Eastern Europe. Gilad points out some factors related to the Jewish Bolshevist movement in Russia and the Zionist occupation of Palestine that echo in present patterns being seen in Turkey, and he emphasizes how Erdogan’s popularity is another clear signal of the nationalist uprising and growing awareness of ethnic belonging. We also look at the perils of today’s trade-driven capitalist Britain, which Gilad calls Mammonism, and was predicted nearly 100 years ago by the genius manufacturer and business tycoon Henry Ford.

Title: Roger Devlin - Islamic Spain: A Multicultural Lie & Trump Reboots American Politics
Date: 2016-07-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1PpHOc6860w
Description: F. Roger Devlin, Ph.D. is an independent scholar. He is the author of Alexandre Kojeve and the Outcome of Modern Thought, Sexual Utopia in Power, and many essays and reviews in such publications as The Occidental Quarterly, American Renaissance, Counter-Currents, VDare, Modern Age, The Social Contract, Alternative Right, and The Last Ditch. A bibliography of his work is available online at Devliniana.

In the first hour, Roger discusses his review of The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise: Muslims, Christians, and Jews under Islamic Rule in Medieval Spain by Dario Fernandez-Morera – a book that refutes the glorification and romanticizing of civilizations that have supposedly reached the same pinnacle of success as Western civilizations. Roger outlines Fernandez-Morera’s analysis of the Moorish conquering of Spain that began with the Arab invasion of 711 AD, when towns were brutally massacred under threat of accepting the Koran or the sword. We discuss the Germanic Visigoths who were in control of the Iberian Peninsula during this time frame and had built up a civilization based in the ways of the Roman Empire. We consider how the current Islamic invasion echoes past religious intolerance, as we’re seeing the utopian dream of multiculturalism trampling on the cultural traditions of the West. Roger emphasizes the reality of the Muslim way of thinking in that the religion of Islam has no comprehension of Western values of female self-determination and self-control, and he says their contemptuous view of women is simply a fundamental tenet that cannot be unlearned or assimilated within the West. Roger has long predicted that feminists would be at the forefront of ushering in another Muslim invasion, as their total lack of understanding of the authoritarian nature of the Muslim religion has ironically created a bridge to the destruction and replacement of the liberal values feminists value most.

In the member hour, we get into the current radicalization of US politics and the unraveling of an ideology that can be seen in the common thread of both Trump and Sanders camps demonstrating Americans’ deep dissatisfaction with the status quo. Roger talks about how Trump has managed to coalesce around the Nationalist movement and warns that we will probably see, yet again, just how little power our presidential puppets have over the liberal democrat policymakers. We look at how the Black Lives Matter movement is working in favor of the Trump campaign, along with why the media has decided to turn on the police and blow the issue of violence against blacks completely out of proportion. Roger points to the religion of modern liberalism and the mainstream media’s emotional programming of the uneducated as the root of the demographic decline of America’s founding stock, and we measure up how the doctrine of equality has fooled many into believing that the immigrant collective is interested in adopting the objectivity of White Western liberals. Then, Roger explains how the decay of the bourgeoisie and the rise of the managerial class to power has shaped the ideology of instant gratification and consumerism as manifested in the globalist corporate model and the bureaucratic monstrosity of government. At the end, we turn our thoughts to educating our future generations of leaders on the follies of racial diversity and the importance of preserving the cultural identity.

Title: James Bacque - Other Losses: Death of Millions of German Prisoners After World War II
Date: 2016-07-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gKGQ65guU3o
Description: James Bacque was born and educated at Upper Canada College and Trinity College in Toronto. He has worked in literature and history since he published his first novel The Lonely Ones, in 1969. Other Losses and Crimes and Mercies, both accounts of the astonishing history of the Allied massacres in postwar Germany, have been sold world-wide. His work has been the subject of a book, an academic conference, and many articles and TV documentaries in Canada, the UK, the USA, France and Germany. Bacque has won several literary prizes and awards, including the Bismarck Medal. His new title, Spirit Builders, chronicles the work of Frontiers Foundation in Canada.

In the first hour, James describes the testimonies he uncovered while researching Other Losses: an Investigation into the Mass Deaths of German Prisoners at the Hands of the Americans and the French after World War Two, a book that caused an international scandal when it was first published in 1989. James gives an overview of the largely suppressed stories of the horrific fates suffered by around 11 million German military men and their families who were taken as prisoners by the Allied Forces. We discuss the issue of soldiers being classified as “disarmed enemy forces” that prevented proper inspections of the work camps by the Red Cross and a resulting cover-up of the famine, exposure to harsh elements, and death that occurred. James explains how the Morgenthau Plan was signed off by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill in a plan of vengeance that destroyed occupied German industry and left the country starving and penniless. As these unthinkable events were unfolding, the suppression of truth on threats of worth and livelihood succeeded in sweeping history under the rug – a masquerade that continues to this day. We consider how falsehoods based in “The Good War” have created an unshakable demonization of Germany, and James talks about the overwhelming support and recognition, as well as the stubborn rejection and ridicule, he has received for dismantling this deceitful narrative.

In the member hour, James goes deeper into the death of truth that has left our world to exist on deliberate deceptions, malevolent myths and biased propaganda. He emphasizes how well Germany has managed to recover and succeed despite the people being pinned as evil and having a deeply ingrained self-hatred. We discuss the German green movement that was created during the rise of National Socialism, and we also address concerns for the environment that are being amplified as massive waves of immigration and the worldwide thirst for Western luxuries overwhelms Europe. Then, James talks about the American military draft and the deceitful propaganda that led Canadian WWI & WWII soldiers to believe they were fighting for mercy, justice and truth. We get into the brutal post-war bombing, pillaging and raping of Germany, along with the great resistance to the Allied atrocities that festered from military Generals down to Privates. James brings forth the idea that history does not need to be revised, but rather it needs to actually be written, as much of what we’ve been told is not worth knowing. At the end, we weigh up the massive stigma and ruin that accompanies examining this dreadful period of history, and how to move forward while approaching journalism with a review mirror as we break the spell of weaponized history.

Title: Matt Forney - Culture Clash in the Run Up to the US Election
Date: 2016-07-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oCJUwI6S7AU
Description: Matt Forney is an author, journalist and entrepreneur currently based in Chicago. A native of Syracuse, New York, he has lived in Canada as well as the Philippines, and studied English and journalism at SUNY Plattsburgh and the University at Albany. Forney is a columnist for Return of Kings and Right On, and blogs regularly at his website MattForney.com. Additionally, he is the author of the self-help guide “Confessions of an Online Hustler” and several other books.

In the first hour, Matt joins us to discuss the culture clash that is casting a dark cloud over the US. We talk about our crucial task as independent journalists to cover and document these crazy times in order to preserve the truth of how history is unfolding. Matt breaks down some of the strange anomalies seen in the video of convicted child molester Alton Sterling being apprehended and killed by Baton Rouge police. The funding by (((George Soros))) of the #blacklivesmatter movement is illuminated, along with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim’s manipulation of the US media to promote illegal immigrant amnesty. We connect the dots between Hillary Clinton’s fervent push for gun control and Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s “Summer of Chaos” scheme that has been revealed through hacked messages between BLM leader Doray McKesson and Johnetta Elzie, which mention bringing on Martial Law by causing chaos at the upcoming Republican National Convention in Cleveland, and thus extending Obama’s presidential term. Then, Matt explains the inner workings of leftist pathologies, namely the rampant narcissism that has created a culture of microaggression-triggered, codependent degenerates. We examine how this largely liberal hive mind mentality has shaped a society around the lowest common denominator, where traditional values of female femininity, male masculinity, nuclear family, and physical and mental fitness are intolerable. Further, we weigh up how the Clinton/Sanders schism has divided the left on identity politics and economic issues, along with indications that Trump is enticing many of these confused voters to the Republican camp.

Title: Cathedral Princess - Women & The Alt-Right: The Awakened White Female - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-07-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=UORKtp-eD2k
Description: Cathedral Princess is the co-host of TheRightStuff.biz podcast, Fash Britannia, which is currently on hiatus due to Britain’s tightening chokehold on free speech.

In this episode, Cathy describes just how stifling the politically correct climate of Britain has become in terms of freedom of speech and expression, as the establishment works diligently to pave the road for the Islamification of Europe. We discuss Sadiq Khan’s move to outlaw “demeaning” advertisements featuring beautiful, fit European women, which ironically illustrates how Muslims are using the plump feminist rhetoric of the left to promote their own misogynistic ideals. We weigh up the average British attitude toward the EU multicult experiment and possible outcomes for the Brexit vote. Cathy gives her take on the rationale behind the atomized political leanings of typical leftwing females, and we consider what makes nationalistic women operate more like a tribe centered on sisterhood and the nuclear family. Further, we get into the question of how to unlock White women from their delusional liberal programming, and we touch on the rumor that the Alt-Right has been infiltrated by homosexuals and woman haters. Then, we look at the difference between European nationalism and the White nationalism mainly espoused in the US. We round off the hour with some thoughts on the resurgence of paganism and pre-Christian spirituality that is bringing nationalist folk around to a better understanding of the importance of ancestral honor and natural order.

Title: Mike Enoch, Seventh Son - The (((Echo))) Can Be Heard In Orlando - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-07-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=zW0nm2tX0As
Description: Mike Enoch and Seventh Son are behind TheRightStuff.biz - a political and cultural blog aimed at reinvigorating dialogue among a disparate and edgy right-wing and rustling jimmies among the childish and regressive left-wing. Their weekly podcast, The Daily Shoah, infuses edgy humor to touch on current events and politics.

Mike and Seventh Son join us following a couple of honored tributes to the Alt-Right – a massive troll on the mainstream press and the Anti-Defamation League adding a new hate symbol to their list, the ((( ))). The Daily Shoah was brought to the world’s attention after Mic.com credited the anti-Semitic podcast for originating the (((echo))), a symbol used to visually represent their signature Semite sound effect. This inspired the (((coincidence detector))) Google Chrome tracking ap that was recently shoahed for violating “hate speech policy” and the resultant “reclaiming” of the parenthesis by various brave Jews across social medialand. Mike explains the fine points and powerful effects of shitposting, trolling and LARPing, and we look at how liberals are getting their cherished reverse psychology systematically flipped on their own whiny asses while their outplayed taboo/boundary breaking/rejection of traditionalism is now the picture of dull normiedom. Seventh Son emphasizes how the convoluted ideologies of “conservatives” and “liberals” have both become the gold standard for the mainstream and elite consensuses, and now ironically appeal to those who are inherently the most authoritarian and intolerant. Then, we touch on the Orlando nightclub mass shooting and the fact that the Democrats are pro-Islam, which empirically represents anti-gay, making the event a valuable wedge issue for derailing the deranged tolerance narrative. We round off with some stabs at the cucked crying and libard logic that twists gun control, homophobia, US foreign policy and Islamaphobia into one big knot of blame for the world’s problems.

Title: Janice Fiamengo - How Academic Feminism Wrecks Women - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-07-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=c4NsghrM7qs
Description: Janice Fiamengo is a Professor of English at the University of Ottawa in Ontario, Canada. Recently she has begun to speak out on men's issues, having become appalled by the bigotry, hypocrisy, and dangerous magical thinking of the modern feminist movement. She is the author of The Fiamengo File, a series of YouTube videos on academic feminism, the situation of men in modern culture, and free speech. She has published numerous essays on feminism and cultural decline at PJ Media and FrontPage Magazine.

A filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members.
http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/extra/program.php?id=1115

Janice is with us to deconstruct how academic feminism is contributing to the ongoing destruction of Western society. She begins by illustrating the climate on college campuses, where the myth of oppressed and marginalized women, vulnerable in a patriarchal world, yet morally superior to men, somehow deserve special protection and privileges to level the playing field. Janice describes the anti-male, anti-nature Marxist narrative permeating women’s and gender studies, which attributes all cultural ills to the evils of masculinity while denying any significant biological basis to gender differences. She gives examples of radical feminist members of Canada’s Revolutionary Student Movement hijacking discussions attempting to address men’s issues, the transformation of female consciousness stemming from misleading data about the West’s supposed rape culture, and other studies that pin men as the sole source of society’s iniquities. We look at why feminists refuse to align with the victims of Muslim supremacy and how the hierarchy of victimhood excuses the barbaric treatment of Muslim women by pointing the finger of blame at White Western males. Janice relates how the victim mentality oozing out of leftist led university classrooms ties to the introduction of various identity studies in the ‘70s, and she talks more about her personal lambasting for daring to speak critically of feminism’s role in the disempowerment of White Western males. We round off the hour by touching on the controlled media’s demonization of Western values and multicultural utopia propaganda, along with what can be done to defeat the mental virus of feminism to restore humanity’s natural order.

Title: Arthur Kemp - March of the Titans: The Rise & Fall of Caucasian Civilization - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-07-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Gf5LRUiGnjA
Description: Arthur Kemp was born in Southern Rhodesia in 1962. Educated in South Africa, he holds a degree in Political Science, International Politics and Public Administration, having studied at the University of Cape Town and the University of South Africa. He is the owner of Ostara Publications and the author of eleven books, including March of the Titans: The Complete History of the White Race.

Arthur joins us for a look at how the aspects of racial homogeneity and racial disillusionment (multiculturalism) have historically contributed to the rise and fall of civilizations. We begin by considering the essential questions of what causes culture and what happens when a civilization’s creators vanish. Arthur talks about the misconceptions of early English colonialism and the vastly different process of mass foreign invasion transpiring in the West today. He addresses the proclivity of the White race to explore the world and provide humanitarian support to the less fortunate, along with the consequences of these interventions. We discuss some logistics of the Out of Africa theory and the role of environment in racial differences, touching on the bureaucratic baloney that thwarts modern day archaeologists from properly investigating tremendous troves of ancient human remains holding clues of Europeans’ origins in the Northern Hemisphere. Then, Arthur explains the dire reality of the population replacement events being orchestrated by the West’s rulers, and we deliberate how to wake up the ill-informed masses to their looming extinction. Kemp also gives an account of his life in South Africa during the ANC’s takeover, relating the hard fact that demographics ultimately dictate the rules. Our conversation rounds off with thoughts on the viability of recruiting quality Europeans to create a great ethnostate and the terrific potential that exists when enough Whites are able to unlearn their self-defeatist programming and abandon the egalitarian fantasies driving their cultures to demise.

Title: Lady LaSSarus - Pro White is Pro Woman. Feminism is Anti-White - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-07-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=aVfdPWc1Kcs
Description: Lady LaSSarus is a traditionalist, wife and aspiring mother from the deep mountain South who wishes to unite the ladies of the Traditionalist/Alt-Right movement. She is opposed to feminism, Cultural Marxism, and Critical Theory.

Lady LaSSarus joins us for a discussion about feminism, women’s matters, and the Alt-Right. We begin with a look into her awakening to the cultural Marxist slant on race issues in the US, which was brought to light through working with Chicago’s south side public school system. Lady LaSSarus gives her views on Trump and the great traction he is receiving as Americans fed up with the crumbling economy and degradation caused by never-ending 3rd world immigration are finally taking a stand. We look at some liberal misconceptions about the viability of multiculturalism and upholding European ideals that are centered on homogeneous, high-trust societies. We also touch on the growing movement of women in the Alt-Right scene and how we can bring more traditionalist-minded females into the fold. We consider how sly feminist programming has created several generations of misguided mothers who have naïvely subjected their daughters to anti-woman and anti-White conditioning, and we delve into ways to reestablish the natural balance of male/female relationships and inspire true veneration of motherhood. Lady LaSSarus shares the steps she has taken to get back to a more Eurocentric way of life and gives inspiring examples of this budding trend. At the end, we lay out some guidelines for connecting with likeminded individuals and tips for men to attract a great Alt-Right soul mate.

Title: Angelo John Gage - Making Europeans Great Again - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-07-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=JQQzTQUxa1k
Description: Angelo John Gage is a political activist who is fighting against Marxism in all its abominable forms. A former US Marine, Gage went on to graduate from the International Center for Positive Change and Hypnosis as a NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) Master Practitioner and Conversational Hypnotist. Angelo helped found and was Chairman of National Youth Front during 2015. He is now concentrating on making our men great again with Resurgence Media Network. 

The filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members. 

http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/extra/program.php?id=1106

Angelo returns to R3F to talk about joining forces with RMN and to fill us in on some of the events that prompted a major shift in his political activism. Gage says the truth alone is not enough to get the masses motivated and he explains how he is using his NLP and life-coaching knowledge to focus on a winning strategy that will inspire people to recognize the enemy within instead of blaming external factors for society’s shortcomings. We discuss effective ways to deliver this message and positively promote the Nationalist movement, and Angelo highlights the main points addressed in his Full Spectrum Dominance strategy. He touches on the troubles with truth seekers getting ensnared in the Jew trap, and we look at how to restore natural order for Europeans by rediscovering roots and embracing Identitarian ideology. We get into Trump’s pull to White interests and his ability to attract broad support from Americans through a simple, hard-hitting and emotionally appealing style. Then, we weigh up the negative stereotypes that have arisen out of the White Nationalist scene, and Angelo lays out what the Alt Right movement can do to counteract the race baiting game being fueled by “Semitic sorcerers.” Later, we look at the feasibility of White secession and Pan-European nationalism considering the vast ethnic diversity that exists within the West. At the end, Gage illuminates the motivating force behind RMN – a return to traditionalism headed by strong men working together towards practical solutions for the future of Europeans.

Title: James Bowery - Sortocracy & Meta-Government: A New Spiritual System
Date: 2016-07-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_QhI_oCUCAc
Description: James Bowery is an American IT pioneer who descends from Scotch-Irish ancestry, with the patriline geographically concentrated in Groningen, Netherlands. He is the architect of Sorotocracy.org

James is with us to share his outline for a new spiritual system, which he calls Sortocracy – “a form of meta-government whose purpose is to render it practical for consenting adults to form their own government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness.” James talks about the life-changing spiritual experience that brought him to the awareness that not all cultures have the same moral sensibility, and respecting the differing moral agencies found around the globe is what truly ennobles us as diverse nations. We talk about the hijacking of Christianity from the top down by evil forces, looking at how congregations are being subverted against their wills through forced engagement with refugee resettlement programs. James then goes into some details about his work in the IT field involving the streamlining of high grade food production. Later, we discuss the main tenets of Sorotocracy, including rigorous borders to exclude outsiders, strict rules and punishments for law breakers, and the allowance for sovereign men to maintain the order of societies through exercising free will and individual judgement. James relates all this and more as to humankind’s rootedness in the primordial experience of creation and nature, the awareness of which has been largely sacrificed as respect for men and the creators of our civilization have been abandoned.

During the member hour we discuss more of James’ proposals for Sorotocracy and he ties in the work of Edward O. Wilson, who wrote “The Social Conquest of Earth.” We consider developments of Europeans as a eugenic culture, with key components being sexual selections based on individual integrity, and also the coevolution with domesticated wolves that taught man the law of the alpha male. We look at the contrasting behaviors of cultures evolving with more dependence on group cohesion rather than individual merits during the time Earth has been dominated by eusocial animals. Then, James illuminates the idea that we need to uncover the knowledge from our ancient shaman ancestors who had deep connections to the paranormal side of nature. We discuss the current degenerative state of our warring world and why the invasions of European lands by more warlike tribes who wish to impose their moral structures clearly signals war is here and it’s our duty to organize and conquer. Further, James addresses the multiracial potential of Sorotocracy, emphasizing that this is possible only through honoring societal laws and agreements. He also delves into how the imposition of politically correct, weaponized rhetoric has broken down our natural power structures that were historically held together by the ability to act with force. At the end, we get into the scary potential of governments taking over the role of reproduction, and how the march toward globalization is threatening the earth’s ecosystems.

Title: Mark Collet - Brexit: The EU will Destroy Britain & the European People
Date: 2016-07-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=poxhG6jlGIM
Description: Mark Collett has been involved in Nationalist politics his entire adult life. He is the former chairman of the Young BNP, the youth division of the British National Party (BNP). Later, Collett was Director of Publicity for the BNP and designed the campaign material that won the party a seat on the Greater London Assembly, two seats in the European Parliament and dozens of local councilors. In the past two months Mark has been hard at work promoting the Leave campaign for the forthcoming EU Referendum in Britain.

Mark joins us for an important dialogue about the upcoming Brexit vote and the promising Leave decision that must occur in order for Britain to free itself of the bureaucratic dictatorship of the EU and regain its national sovereignty. We discuss the undemocratic nature of the EU and the £350 million per week that is spent by Britain on a membership that curtails rights to control its own borders, protect its own resources, make its own laws and manage its own industries. Mark underscores the crucial problem of the EU Schengen Zone that allows throngs of unchecked 3rd world migrants, including hostile terrorists, to seep through Britain’s main access artery at the Calais tunnel. This issue is compounded by lax rules on asylum seekers that allow families of ‘refugees’ to be reunited within the borders of host countries, causing enormous influx and placing unmanageable stress on hospitals, schools and infrastructure while creating a horrible culture clash as the White working class of Britain is replaced by unrecognizable enclaves incapable of assimilation. Mark describes the insanity of the politicians pushing this multicult agenda of White genocide and the sneaky media programming that has a society of self-loathing Brits believing in the follies of White privilege and vibrant diversity. Then, we look at the important role that parties like UKIP are playing in legitimizing the message of reclaiming Britain’s sovereignty and control over the failed policies of the left.

In the members’ segment, we examine the unique flavor of ethnomasochism that makes Europeans particularly susceptible to anti-White brainwashing. Mark reminds us how the wondrous technological advancements developed by Europeans are now being employed as weapons of mass destruction against us, as the discordance of diversity splits cohesive communities into selfish, self-hating, guilt-ridden zombies huddled indoors, living on steady diets of media mental poison and processed garbage foods. Mark says this unnatural state can be chalked up to society’s overall divorce from nature, which is clearly illustrated in the rise of depression, anxiety, and mental malaise, the unprecedented volume of pharmaceutical drug consumption, and the number of degenerate role models that are propped up to further muddle the definition of wellbeing for our impressionable youth. Further, we look at the confusion and degradation being caused from touting the line that “everyone is a winner” and protecting children from dealing with any kind of defeat. We also consider how the West’s legacy of high-trust societies has resulted in a weakened culture preoccupied with consuming creature comforts, while the environmental strain this causes is completely forgotten. At the end, we get into the steps that must be taken for Brits and Europeans to eradicate corrupt law makers and police forces, regain control of our governments, and secure genuine nationalist representatives of our communities.

Title: Filip Dewinter, Sam Van Rooy - Flemish independence & Islamization of Europe
Date: 2016-06-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vynyb9Hc9CA
Description: Filip Dewinter is a member of the Flemish Parliament and one of the leading members of Vlaams Belang, a Flemish nationalist party in the Flanders Region and Brussels of Belgium. He is the author of “Inch’Allah? The Islamization of Europe.” Sam Van Rooy is a spokesman for Vlaams Belang and the author and co-editor of “Islam: Critical Essays on Political Religion,” and “Europe Falters: The Abduction of Europe by the EU.”

Filip and Sam join us to talk about the nationalist force in Western Europe that is steadily expanding in response to its cultural and demographic transformation wrought from over 40 years of Islamic intrusion. The gentlemen address the main focus of Vlaams Belang, which deals with issues of Flemish independence, opposition to multiculturalism, and defense of traditional Western values. We learn how Belgium was artificially created in 1830 as a buffer zone between Germany and France, essentially erasing the identity of the ancient Flemish culture in order to serve the interests of England and Germany. We discuss Brexit and the potential for a powerful domino effect to bust open the doors for other European countries that wish to be free of the EU’s bureaucratic clutches. Filip illustrates the cultural and economic devastation that has been caused by open borders and the refusal of the EU elites to recognize Islam’s intent for world domination, and we look at the role the multicultural project plays in intensifying Jihadi attacks like those seen in Paris and Brussels, and most recently Orlando. We consider how the liberal left has been complicit in the “tyranny of guilt” that appeases Muslim incompatibility within Western civilization – a perversion pronounced most poignantly in London’s recent mayoral election of the Muslim member of the socialist Labour Party, Sadiq Khan. Sam talks about the growing negative sentiments of Europeans who are fed up with their traditional Western family values being assaulted and marginalized, and he emphasizes the value of propagandizing a patriotic revival. We also discuss the financial motives behind the elite’s ideology of mass immigration and the brainwashing that has yielded a shrinking indigenous birth rate and an explosion of invader offspring. At the end, we weigh up the crucial tasks of breaking free from the chains of cultural nihilism and reinvigorating the fertile youth to produce enough descendants to get the 3rd world and Islam off the West’s back yet again.

Title: Daniel, GW, Kumiko - Brexit: Time for the UK to Leave the EU
Date: 2016-06-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oFa-WcazYC0
Description: Guessedworker (GW) is an English nationalist in favor of international nationalism. Having lived in 1950s era Britain, he has since seen his nation undermined by neo-liberalism and Jewish-inspired leftism. He created Majorityrights.com in 2004 as a forum to find solutions for the myriad of problems facing not only the British people, but all European peoples as well. Kumiko Oumae is the Eurasian affairs contributor for Majorityrights.com. She believes that in order for Europe to control its own destiny – and for it to be a good trade and global development partner for Asian countries – there must be a serious dialogue on Europe's historical role in the world and the justification of that role, as well as how the European states can resolve the crisis of legitimacy that their governments are presently facing. Kumiko also works in the security and defense sector in the United Kingdom. An ex-pat American of European descent, Daniel Sienkiewicz now lives in Europe. He has been troubled by the implications of "anti-racism" and has been testing various means to advocate for European peoples for as long as he can remember. Daniel rejects many common approaches, including all characteristically Cartesian attempts, such as scientism, as ineffective means to solve the problems that currently threaten ethnic Europeans.

We begin by discussing Brexit and its significance in the ongoing struggle between nationalism and internationalism. Kumiko argues that, in many ways, the current economic paradigm in the West isn’t quite internationalism proper, but rather the United States being allowed to dominate due to passivity on behalf of the European Union. Despite a few minor disagreements, all three guests adamantly support withdrawal from the European Union. We then discuss the original vision of the European Union – that of a unified, more prosperous Europe – and how the elites therein have sabotaged that vision by allowing in millions of non-European immigrants. Later, we talk about the unfortunate lack of patriotism within certain European countries. We conclude this episode with a discussion on the manner in which the mainstream media has used the murder of Jo Cox as an excuse to those in favor of Brexit.

Title: James Sears - Your Ward News: Battling Canadian Marxism with Humor
Date: 2016-06-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5c87ttHZIBA
Description: Dr. James Sears is the leader of the New Constitution Party of Canada, a medical doctor by training, and Editor-In-Chief of “Your Ward News.” He is an advocate for male masculinity and provides one-to-one coaching for men looking to hone their skills in the taming of the FemiMarxist shrew, and James is also a top Canadian medical fraud and malpractice investigator.

Dr. Sears joins us for a discussion about various free speech issues in Canada and his activism as Editor-In-Chief of the largest anti-Marxist publication in the world, "Your Ward News," which is delivered each month by Canada Post to 305,000 addresses in Toronto, and read by over one million people. Due to controversy surrounding YWN’s content and distribution, Sears has been the subject of more hate crime investigations than any other person in Canadian history. James describes his recent tangle with Judy Foote, the Minister of Public Services, who, after “believing” that YWN would commit a future act of circulating defamatory libel, issued a bogus “Prohibitory Order” that strips rights to postal service from Sears and the newspaper’s main affiliates. We get into the issue of censorship in context to humor and how Marxists twist their dogma to inflate victimization narratives – from the holohoax to #blackliesmatter, feminist hysteria and the tranny agenda. Then, James dishes the dirt on Warren Kinsella, the Canadian Liberal Party “strategist” trying to shut down YWN, along with pro-Israel, Evangelical Christian radio host Andrew Lawton, who compares Sears to "George Galloway” and “Hamas.” These absurd connections sadly illustrate the sheer denseness of looney liberal logic, which Dr. Sears has experienced extensively in scads of unhinged responses to his frequently misinterpreted, provocative parody pieces.

For the members’ hour, we focus on the growing wave of Westerners who have honed in on the Zio-Marxist controlled garbage narrative that has run its course in destroying natural order. James describes where he sees the tide dramatically turning amongst young kids who are embracing Nationalism as the bullshit education/indoctrination machine crumbles under the weight of overturned sacred cows, forced diversity and illogical identity politics. Then, Sears talks about his masculinity agenda, which he is spearheading through education for men about the harmful effects of the testosterone disrupting plastics in our environments and feminizing phytoestrogens prominently found in foods cherished by vegans. James introduces the trollworthy characters, Dimitri the Lover and SeXXXy Eddy, who he created to expose how the problem of artificially deactivated testosterone amongst Occident men is working in conjunction with the flood of oversexualized, aggressive immigrants who are getting the Kalergi red carpet treatment from our treasonous elite. We get into the questions of culture, race and tribe loyalty in the Nationalist movement, and how to make the ideology more attractive to women through assertiveness and brute force. We wrap by assessing the MSM response to the June 12 Orlando nightclub massacre – another glaring example of warped liberal “tolerance” for the despicable actions of certain victim classes in lieu of universal moral standards.

Title: Andrew Fraser - The Wasp Question
Date: 2016-06-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=dt7UZH5m37M
Description: Andrew Fraser studied both law and history in Canada and the United States. After moving to Australia, he taught legal history and constitutional law at Macquarie University in Sydney. He is the author The WASP Question .(Arktos 2011) and the forthcoming Dispatches from the Divinity School.

Andrew joins us for a compelling look into The WASP Question, which addresses the lost sense of ethnic identity of Anglo-Saxon peoples in Western civilization. Drew talks about his views on multiculturalism and feminism that triggered various controversies at Macquarie University and the impetus for writing his book. He cites the English covenantal character and the development of the law of the contract as key features responsible for WASP’s ability to thrive economically and develop into a unified polity. We examine why the island of England has been historically targeted for invasion and subjugation, and how the Danes, Normans, Vikings, Dutch and Scandinavians managed to be absorbed despite the clashing ways of English Christians and Nordic pagans. Drew describes the pivotal time during the 17th century Civil War when English identity became defined by law and mercantilism, and we look at how the rise of civic nationalism in the new world order age of widespread immigration within the West led to the corrosion of WASP identity. Further, Drew gives his take on the postmodern rebirth of Anglo Saxon Christendom and the Trinitarian nature of race, ethnicity and theology, and how the now globalist Anglican church should be nurturing a sense of common ethnic identity. He also points to the US’s “cult of constitution” as being responsible for its abandonment of religious identity, resulting a theological issue that must be addressed for WASP survival. 

In the members’ segment, Drew talks more about his ethno-theological approach to the WASP question and his case for the proposition that Christianity is a religion grounded in ethnic identity. He argues that the stories in the bible, from Genesis through Revelations, refer to a particular people and are guides for what it means to be a holy nation. We discuss the Catholic church’s betrayal of the European people and its exacerbation of the refugee crisis through the adoption of Unitarianism. We go back to the creation of the protestant Anglican church by Alfred the Great and the relationship between the English state and the papal monarchy. Drew illuminates the emergence of Judaeo-Christianism, the missing link of modern Jews to ancient Israelites, the ending of the covenant with old Israel in AD 70, and the Synagogue of Satan. Then, we look at the rise of globalist Zionism since WWII and the JQ factor in the decline of Western Christianity, along with the unacceptable turning of the other cheek by liberals to the horrific war crimes by the “chosen ones.” Drew says the “Trumpening” in the US is a positive sign that the narrative is being rewritten, but the unsustainable perpetual economic growth paradigm could result in a new dark age where tribal identity will be a crucial. In conclusion, Drew gives his perspectives on the role feminism plays in pathological altruism and on the effects of multiculturalism in Australia.

Title: Vox Day and Cynic In Chief - The SJW List, The ((( Coincidence ))) & The Cuckservative
Date: 2016-06-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5Kcg6P_BOrc
Description: Vox Day is a writer, a professional game designer and a three-time Billboard top 40 recording artist. He is the author of SJWs Always Lie: Taking Down the Thought Police and Cuckservative: How "Conservatives" Betrayed America. Cynic In Chief is a professional computer programmer, founder of SJWList.com, and amateur poll stalker. When not sitting in front of a computer, he can be found travelling, riding roller coasters, hiking, and caving.

Note: Due to an unknown audio issue, the recording became damaged around the 48 minute mark. We decided to leave it in. We apologize for the technical error. We’re working on making sure it doesn’t happen again in future recordings. Thanks for your understanding.

In this episode, Vox and Cynic In Chief plug the SJW List, a complete catalog of Social Justice Warriors created to help SJW-converged organizations locate and identify Social Justice Warriors they wish to hire or otherwise support. ;-) This list names people and companies that have actively engaged in the brand of dastardly groveling designed to target and sully the reputations of individuals who fail to abide by the SJW code of conduct. Cynic talks about some common tactics that so-called conservatives and mentally unstable lefties employ in proselytizing their ever-mutating narrative, and we look at how the Alt-Right’s technological edge has proved effective in exposing the weak links in the narrow opinion corridor of the politically correct. Vox lays out the modern roots of conservatism and explains how liberal democrats managed to transform the republican party during the hippie era, and the guys describe the main concerns of the right: Nationalism, Western Civilization and Winning. In closing, we discuss the best methods for derailing any SJW attack, Vox highlights his latest book, Cuckservative, and we get into modes of actively participating in the Alt-Right movement.

Title: Julian Langness - Fistfights with Muslims in Europe
Date: 2016-06-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Jj19e71mZgk
Description: Julian Langness writes about European politics, 4th Generation Warfare, identity, masculinity, and society. He regularly contributes articles to a range of websites including Traditional Right and Counter-Currents, and is also the editor of EuropeanCivilWar.com. Langness is the author of Fistfights With Muslims In Europe: One Man’s Journey Through Modernity.

In this discussion, Julian takes us through events during his pilgrimage to his ancestral lands in Norway and extended encounters in Europe over a five-year period in the early 2000s that inspired him to pen his first book, Fistfights With Muslims. These travels led to Julian’s awakening to what it means to be a man in the modern Western world and the dichotomy of Islam and Middle-Eastern culture. We discuss the fact that violence has been largely bred out of Western culture in this age of prosperity where feminized, cultural Marxists males rule, yet the natural impulse for danger and existential challenge remains in the hearts and minds of the majority of ordinary men. Julian relates how many 2nd and 3rd generation Muslims in Europe live with a sense of deracination and disconnectedness from their own tribal identity, and as new Muslim transplants reject assimilation in a culture consumed by decadent pacifism, there is no wonder most hold steadfast to the narrative that evil Whites deserve to be be conquered. Further, Julian talks about the tactics of 4th generation warfare and what he calls the ‘suicidalism’ of the governing elites in Western Europe that are zealously championing for their own destruction.

In the member half, we look at the West’s rapidly shifting demographics and the grim reality of the plummeting promise of Whites in terms of their low birth rates, indoctrinated self-hatred, abandonment of religion, and the rise of nihilism. We discuss the glimmer of hope arising out of countries like Sweden, where rape and violent crime has finally gotten to such a horrific state that a few vigilante groups are emerging to protect their folk and territory. Then, Julian explains the concept of C4ISR structures – a command apparatus that was utilized during the American Revolutionary War that allowed high ranking elite freemasons to communicate and strategize – a template that can be mirrored in the event that our suicidal governments do lead Western Europe into civil war. Langness highlights an article he wrote for Counter Currents where he hypothesizes what’s in store if Muslims and Europeans engage in an all-out 4GW conflict, which is already being predicated through the increasingly chaotic state brought on by the invasion and delegitimized state of the standing government. At the end, we consider how a complete collapse could be the destructive force and shared struggle that is needed to reinvigorate the masculine force required for the Europe to triumph over Islam.

Title: Andrew Joyce - The History of Jewish Influence
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Ts1aidG_hjk
Description: Andrew Joyce PhD is a scholar, speaker and writer with academic expertise in immigration, ethnic and religious conflict, and philosophy. Andrew sits on the Editorial Advisory Board of The Occidental Quarterly and is a regular contributor to The Occidental Observer. He also serves the British Renaissance Policy Institute in an advisory capacity and will be producing and editing a new journal for BRPI. He is in the final stages of preparing for publication Talmud and Taboo: Essays on The Jewish Question.

Dr. Joyce joins us for another critical look inside the history and events that continually lead us back to the immense Jewish question. To begin, Andrew highlights his academic journey and how he arrived at tackling the vast obstacles embedded within our propagandized Western history to get to the truth of Jewish influence. We discuss their role during the Middle Ages as middleman merchants in close alliance with the elite powers that be, when the practice of usury transformed the means by which Europe was expanded and consolidated. Andrew explains some misconceptions about Jewish emancipations during the medieval period, many of which were influenced by the weakening of monarchal power and the rise of parliamentary democracy in host nations. Then, we consider how the Jewish proclivity of exploiting weaknesses within the flawed democratic system, their fierce ethnocentricity, and deep fear of being racially and genetically disseminated has compelled them to intensely strategize against gentiles. Andrew talks about the cycle of greed within the monarchy system that led to numerous Jewish expulsions and the clever maneuvers that repeatedly brought them and their money back into the untouchable ruling elite fold. We also look at the current calamity of governmental errors driving Europeans to extinction and how Jews have contributed in shaping the demographic suicide of the West.

In the members’ half, we address the concern that there tends to be an unhealthy obsession with the JQ and how we can study our own weaknesses in terms of damaged ethnic cohesion in balancing this weighty issue. Dr. Joyce stresses that we must find rational ways to communicate to the average citizen how our deprived sense of historical peoplehood coupled with the barrage of guilt inducing MSM and academic programming is leading us to the slaughter. We talk about the great power of face to face persuasion and leading by example, along with using humorous memes and trolling in encouraging our folk to adopt a sense of nationalistic pride. Then, Andrew illuminates how Jews have used a backdoor trial and error approach to slowly infiltrate special interest groups aiming to clamp down on freedoms to criticize detractors, and we look at what a massive cultural shift might look like if Whites can employ that same diligence in reversing the pathologically blind response to their destruction. Further, we discuss the immense responsibility that lies in safeguarding the inheritance of our future generations, which ultimately requires a strong ethnic brotherhood standing in radical resistance to the invading cultures that have no place within our own. At the end, we get into the idea that everything happening now with the push for multiculturalism in the West is just history repeating itself, and if we are to reverse this creeping genocide we must bring more awareness, raise the stakes, and adapt an attitude of total success.

Title: Jason Jorjani - Prometheus and Atlas
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=hpJ8CidZqf4
Description: Jason Reza Jorjani, PhD is a native New Yorker and Iranian-American of Persian and Northern European descent. After receiving his BA and MA at New York University, he completed his doctorate in Philosophy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Jorjani currently teaches Science, Technology, and Society (STS) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He is the author of Prometheus and Atlas (Arktos, 2016). Dr. Jorjani is also a member of the Iranian Renaissance movement.

Dr. Jorjani joins us for an enlightening overview of Prometheus and Atlas, a book essentially describing a coming scientific revolution that would move civilization past the current Cartesian paradigm through a reordering of society and politics. Jason brings forth his idea of a ‘spectral revolution,’ which calls for a conscious recognition of the often suppressed and marginalized research on psychical phenomena such as clairvoyance and telekinesis. We discuss CIA funded parapsychology (psi) studies at Stanford Research Institute on remote viewing and the destabilizing effects on society that could result from mainstream recognition of this human ability to transcend time and space. Jason underscores how the existence of psychic capabilities in the animal kingdom and in primitive tribes proves that human ESP is not just a supernatural phenomenon, but an atrophied human ability, as evidenced by the sophistication of ancient civilizations. Then, Jason illuminates the Greek archetype of Prometheus, the creator god of the Aryans who steals fire from Olympus to bring the light of knowledge to the human race and whose abilities of anticipatory projection are embodied in the European spirit of exploration and discovery. We trace through the tale of Atlas, brother of Prometheus and bearer of the celestial sphere, whose mythic burden is connected to the aesthetic idea of atlases, models, charts and maps of all kinds. Jason also details the rise and fall of Atlantis and its hybridized demigods who acted as stewards over the cosmopolitan knowledge they seeded across the ancient world, and we frame these primeval myths within the context of modern colonialism and technological advancement.

In the member segment, we delve into the suppression of the spectral and the ordering of binary oppositions. Jason defines the nature of ordering chaos in terms of craftsmanship and fine art, illustrating how the tone and mode of societies is set by poets, artists and architects. We look at the need for a global regulatory mechanism that can be applied across the powers of technology, governing an order that avoids negative diversity while revering genuine human psi capabilities and using a biomechanical approach. Jason summarizes “Worlds at War Over Earth,” a chapter in Prometheus and Atlas that addresses the question of religion, the materialistic nature of humans, and the soulless sciences that have been aided in propagation by the church. We discuss the state of the folk as a total work of art, in that the cultivation of an animalistic relationship to the truth is reflected in art, thus setting the cultural tone. Then, Jason delineates the fundamental reasons why Islam has no place in a world governed by Atlas and consciously embracing the Promethean spirit, and he talks about the stage of decadence, decline and disintegration that has been set by liberal values and capitalism. Further, we get into Nietzsche’s criticisms of liberalism and his idea of three modes of history – antiquarian, monumental, and critical. Jason also explains the concepts of archeofuturism and Mercurial hermeneutics, and we consider the vast body of ancient wisdom manipulated and destroyed during the rise of Abrahamic religions. At the end, we discuss possibilities of advanced, otherworldly intelligence manipulating the human race and some bizarre close encounters that suggest we’re dealing with a cosmic trickster using black humor to help us realize the potential of a full spectral revolution.

Title: Nathan Damigo - Identitarian Activism & Identity Evropa
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gNHppdtKg40
Description: Nathan Damigo is a combat veteran of the Iraq war, currently studying for an undergraduate degree in Social Science at the University of California, Stanislaus. He is the creator and host of On The Front, a podcast delivered from an Identitarian perspective. In March 2016 Nathan created Identity Evropa, a North American based Identitarian organization dedicated to creating a new future for People of European Heritage. His work has been published in Radix Journal and activities as a blogger have been reported by Time Magazine.

The filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members.
http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/radio/program.php?id=1114

To begin, Nathan highlights his involvement with National Youth Front and the circumstances that led him to disband the organization and form the entirely new model for Identity Evropa. He gives a brief account of his Marine Corps tours in Iraq and his rough reentry into civilian life that prompted a very deep and disturbing investigation into the origins of Middle East conflicts, thus connecting him to the vein of human biological and genetic diversity. Then, Nathan recaps the Identity Evropa engagement at UC Berkeley where he, Richard Spencer, Johnny Monoxide, and other supporters created a ‘safe space’ in Sproul Plaza for discussions about race and White interests. This demonstration marks a significant milestone of publically challenging the cultural Marxist dominated social sciences and humanities departments throughout Western academia. It has also opened up a fresh platform for continued conversations on the viability and consequences of the culture of equality/diversity that is overrepresented in liberal institutions. Nathan talks about the momentum IE is enjoying as Trump continues to channel the discontent of marginalized Americans of European descent into a renewed interest in the preservation of their heritage and interests.

In the members’ hour, Nathan delves into the political angle of Identity Evropa and the organization’s strategies for networking with politicians who want to get involved in the movement. We look at the drastic shifting of America’s demographics and what the current mass movements of POC to European nations represents for the destiny of the planet at large. We also consider the responsibility Whites have as effective stewards of the wealth and technology that has afforded the West its attractive luxuries and freedoms. Then, Damigo emphasizes the crucial aspect of tackling these challenges with positivity and constructive energy, and he outlines how to disarm some of the seriousness and frame conversations that will entice new people to come into the fold of understanding. Furthermore, he gives examples of these valuable tactics in action during the Berkeley engagement, underscoring the great tools of evoking negative labels on detractors and pointing out the double standards of deconstructing European identity. At the end, we touch on Identity Evropa’s core motive of providing role models for the vast numbers of youth who are discovering the Alt Right and seeking out guidance in the cause.

Title: Tough Love - The Western Tradition, Art Activism & The Pursuit of The Real
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=e1qCFOsHBSE
Description: Tough Love is an artist and blogger from New Zealand who writes from a Eurocentric perspective on his blog ToughLoveLetters. He makes regular solo exhibitions of paintings that deal with Abstract Language and the history of Western Painting. Tough Love has been making art since he was young and pursued it at a tertiary level, which led to technical and teaching positions in the field. Recently he has turned his attention towards the notion of art activism from a New Right perspective.

Tough Love joins us for a deep deliberation on the powerful weapon of art and its potential to combat the degenerate penetration of the left dominated art sphere. He delves into his battle with the disillusionment reaped from New Zealand’s liberal education system and how he pushed on to establish a unique art process that coincided with his breakthrough into the Alt Right realm. We discuss how modern art has chewed away at the history of Western civilization’s traditional foundations, leaving behind a hollowed out version of true artistry. Tough Love describes how the advent of photography transformed classical painting techniques of creating realistic, stylized images, breaking through the boundaries of space, light and tonal modulation producible by a camera. We look at the role of industrialization and mechanization in moving painting away from representing more logical extensions of real space and time towards reductionism and the removal of traditional elements, which is mirrored in the current era’s egalitarian inclinations. Further, Tough Love relates how modern artists like Pollock, Picasso and Warhol influenced the collapsing of boundaries between art and life by bringing the forces of the physical universe into dictating the art form.

In the members’ hour, Tough Love gets into using the mechanism of art to confront the system that has attacked tradition and remedying our post-modern amnesia for the veritable language of art. He says that the best works of art are ones that can naturally link back into their history, offering a visual dialogue that goes beyond just the critique of culture. We discuss the iconic Warhol prints and their representation of the mass production process that defined a new ability of making art out of any image. Then, Tough Love goes on to define the high stakes of making art that emulates the classic masters, as well as what it takes to seize the attention of a viewer to create a jarring experience, and he addresses the challenging aspects of revitalizing great Western creative traditions considering the total leftwing hijacking of the Avant guard. Later, we touch on some grotesque and bizarre things considered to be art, along with the overrepresentation of degeneracy and oppression. At the end, we look at how we can use the tools we already have in place to restore and rejuvenate the quality of contemporary art to yield sophisticated messages that pack the right punch and inspire greatness.

Title: Jeff Wilkerson - Sion's Army: The Freemasons
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3toUTUYuZ4M
Description: After graduating from university in 1977, Jeff Wilkerson was drawn in the direction of political activism. He became a leader in the Populist Party and a member of the National Alliance. His activism slowed in the early millennial years as he married and started a family. In 2008, he began researching for his first book, Sion's Army - The Freemasons, which he published in 2015.

Jeff discusses the exploits of the followers of the shadowy Priory of Sion and explains how they schemed to spin a web of intrigue in their pursuit of world domination, ultimately inventing their own form of Freemasonry to be used as their private army. He'll provide a historical scope of Sion’s Army starting with the early history of Judaism and ending with the defeat of Napoleon. Jeff elaborates on various Jewish sects, including the revolutionary figure of Jesus and he details how in the eighteenth century the rapidly expanding Freemasonry movement played crucial roles in the conflagrations known as the American and French revolutions.

Later, Jeff tackles how this agenda of the top tier elites of the Freemasons are being implemented and how it has affected Western Civilization, as well as the development of the United States from its beginning. We discuss the goals of Freemasonry and whether or not Trump’s presidential campaign is part of that agenda.

Title: Johnny Monoxide - The Red Pill Process
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZCh_HlR37Qs
Description: Johnny Monoxide is an electrician from Northern California by way of the East Coast who is also the Fashy, Funny, and Goyish host of a comedy podcast for The Right Stuff, called The Current Year Tonight.

Johnny joins us for a chat about waking up to the anti-White agenda, discovering the Alt-Right scene, and current trends in the movement. We begin with a look back onto Johnny’s winding road through the conspiracy theory world anarchism, libertarianism, anti-authoritarianism, and actually participating in Black Lives Matter protests. He talks about his east coast Italian upbringing and early exposure to the JQ, along with Red Ice’s influence on his red-pilling process and realization that he’d been duped on many levels and poisoned by self-loathing lefty political correctness. We look at the cultural revolution that is swiftly taking hold within the millennial generation as humor and trolling are embraced to cut through the absurdness of the SJW craze. Johnny illustrates the incoherence of the average “normie” regarding the sheer depth of the psychological programming being utilized by the controlled media, and the acuteness of the brainwashing to the beauties of diversity that has most well-meaning folks blindly cheering for their own destruction. Then, we make some predictions about the West’s progressive death march and how we can use comedy to expose Whites to the muck of multiculturalism and inspire embracing a righteous sense of identity.

In the member segment, Johnny recounts a recent excursion to a republican state convention in Burlingame, CA, where he encountered hundreds of Trump protesters and experienced the brunt of the rabid racism festering within the Mexican La Raza movement. Jonny gives some examples of what it’s like seeing a decent CA neighborhood desecrated by Obama’s pet HUD housing initiative, and we mull over the mayhem that has ensued as American monuments and living history are given the racist stamp of obliteration. We consider how altruistic Whites have been guilted into advocating for and engineering their own destruction through tainted history lessons and crooked broadcasting from the teLIEvision. Furthermore, we discuss how an infection of flat-out communistic ideology has managed to hide out in the West since WWII, and we consider the beautiful guilt removing antidote that exists in waking up to this fallacious chapter of history. At the end, we poke some fun at the Jew-installed, “dangerous faggot” commentator, Milo Yiannopoulos, and his ridiculous attempts at infiltrating the Alt-Right scene, and Johnny talks more about The Current Year Tonight and his direction for turning the manipulated media on its silly head through comedy.

Title: Jared Taylor - The Rise of European Advocacy & Trump
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=SkvSyG6w-Ps
Description: Jared Taylor is an American journalist, editor of the webzine American Renaissance and president of New Century Foundation organization, both dedicated to the study of immigration and race relations. Mr. Taylor is the author of several books and scholarly papers, including Paved with Good Intentions and White Identity: Racial Consciousness for the 21st Century. 

A filmed version of this interview is available for Red Ice members.
http://www.redicemembers.com/secure/extra/program.php?id=1109 

Jared begins by talking about his recent debate at Kentucky State University with political science professor Dr. Wilfred Reilly, where the great advantage of racial diversity in America was disputed. Jared touches on the media flurry he’s enjoyed as Trump bashers attempt to pin the presidential hopeful to a ‘hate monger,’ and we look at the mainstream silence that characteristically surrounds any reporting on the extent of interracial crime. We weigh up the monumental opportunity for highlighting this hypocrisy that the now delayed trial of Dylann Roof offers if he’s allowed to take the stand and present an explanation for his motives. Then, Jared details the upcoming American Renaissance Conference slated for May 20-22 at Montgomery Bell State Park in Burns, Tennessee. He gives the history of the event that has seen over two decades of significant growth, and talks about the lineup, which includes presentations from Peter Brimelow, Fernando Cortéz, Filip Dewinter, James Edwards, Ruuben Kaalep, RamZPaul, Dan Roodt, Anke Van dermeersch, Sam Dickson, and a special video premier from Uncuck the Right. Hour one concludes with an assessment of Trump’s unapologetic ‘America first’ stance and his savvy appeal to nationalism. 

In our member segment, we dig deeper into Trump’s pioneering efforts to address shoddy US borders and the perils of illegal immigration. Jared speaks to the direct expression of national racial chauvinism being displayed by Mexican protesters at Trump rallies, and we look at the shattered financial state and festering cultural warzone coloring America’s southern territories. We consider why Trump has led the pack amongst the most culturally diverse states, and what Sanders’ flawed rhetoric on the beauties of socialism has to say about the naivety of the liberal mindset. Taylor emphasizes the Scandinavian model’s main ingredient of ethnic homogeneity and how the strategy will never work for America as long as the war mongering administration continues to deliver democracy in the form of bombs to the Middle East. We also touch on Hillary Clinton’s role in the utterly deplorable US foreign policy moves that have ripped apart Syria and resulted in the refugee explosion. Then, Jared summarizes some of the main points that are addressed in the 3rd edition of The Color of Crime, which breaks down the seldom reported Hispanic/Black/White/Asian statistical comparisons of the nature of crime in the US. We end on the concept of White privilege and the idea of race as a social construct.

Title: Don Fotheringham - The President Makers: How Billionaires Control US and Foreign Policy
Date: 2016-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=E4BXpByNxbg
Description: Don Fotheringham is a WWII Marine Corp Veteran who fought in the Pacific following Pearl Harbor and was awarded the Bronze Star for heroic action at Iwo Jima. After discovering that the policy makers leading America’s war effort had concealed their internationalist aims from the public, he embarked on a lifelong study of America’s foundations and the forces seeking to subvert them. Fotheringham is the author of The President Makers: How Billionaires Control US and Foreign Policy and he lectures widely for Freedom First Society and serves on its Board of Directors.

In this discussion, Don details his discoveries of the deceitful agenda being played out by the elite members of the Council on Foreign Relations and their ultimate goal of overthrowing the national sovereignty of the USA. He asserts that the scheme began to take shape over 125 years ago, when the nation’s most prominent industrialists – John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, and Andrew Carnegie – took possession of the major newspapers and began cultivating a public attitude receptive to globalism and socialism. Don highlights how Carnegie managed to cheat the free enterprise system to build up his steel empire in the railroad business, how Rockefeller swindled his way to the top of the oil industry to become America’s first billionaire, and how Morgan amassed tremendous wealth by manipulating stock markets and financing governments. We learn how the three richest men in the world converged and took a page out of the Rothschild playbook of buying off war mongering politicians and getting governments in debt. Don explains how the Federal Reserve came to fruition in 1917 after Morgan’s newspapers hyped up the phony Bank Panic of 1907. Then, how the Bolshevik Revolution was financed by Morgan and Rockefeller under the direction of President Wilson is illuminated.

In the members’ hour, we focus on the largescale media takeover, prompted by the negative press Rockefeller and crew was receiving for shady swindling, which placed these tycoons in a powerful position to radically control America’s narrative and flow of information. Don delineates how this grip has burgeoned into the six mega-conglomerates – Disney, TimeWarner, CBS, General Electric, Viacom and News, Inc. We look at the tremendous leverage these ties represent and how today’s media titans, including Rupert Murdoch, Sumner Redstone and Brian Roberts, are in collusion with CFR plans for world domination. A bit of a debate ensues as we discuss the special interests groups in cahoots at the helm of this control, and we come up with some differing opinions about the impact that AIPAC has on US involvement in the perpetual state of Middle East war. We also touch on the creation and funding of ISIS and how Israel and the CFR play into the nefarious conspiracy. Later, we look at the tremendous war Trump has been fighting with the media and how disingenuous reporting is effectively exposing the establishment’s dirty tricks. Don rounds off the conversation with insights on dismantling the current corrupt government and he explains how Freedom First Society is working to restore the USA’s basic constitutional principles.

Title: Colin McKay - Occult Banking: Semitic Origins of Double-Entry Bookkeeping & Money Creation - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=KjcyeS3ISOw
Description: Colin McKay is an Australian born entrepreneur living in New South Wales. From 2010-2014 he blogged on finance, economics, and Australian politics and in 2010 he served as board member and bookkeeper for the Center for Economic Stability. In 2011 he presented his own concept for Deror, an alternate currency ecosystem where "everyone is their own central banker.” McKay blogs at Psalmistice.com and is presently writing a book tracing the foundations of double-entry accounting to ancient Semitic cults. 

Colin is with us to provide a detailed overview of his essay “The Money Shot: Even Banking Is All About Sex,” which presents the history and mechanisms of el modo vinegia (“the Venetian method”) of double-entry bookkeeping. He explains how this Hermetic-Kabbalist system for calculating debts that was formalized during the early Renaissance period has been used for deliberately concealing the immoral practice of usury in the banking system. Colin describes how the ancient Semitic worship of the androgynous goddess Inanna-Ishtar and the principle of the unity of opposites (male/female, order/disorder, creation/destruction), used in combination with trickery in the form of deceitful words, is the fundamental underlying concept of creating “money” out of nothing. He illustrates how this “magick” is represented by the Hermetic-Kabbalist alchemical symbol of the hexagram (Seal of Solomon) and breaks down the two-sided, sexual nature of the process at the heart of usury. Then, we discuss Professor Richard Werner’s investigations of the central banking system in Japan and his legal perspective of credit. Colin also talks about the practice of money lending within the Catholic church and the 14th century transformation of modern banking that occurred when the church adopted the Venetian method. 

In the members’ segment, Colin addresses the importance of understanding the mechanisms of the central banking system and the creation of credit by private banks. He explains how the predatory banking system’s core fraud revolves around the changing of labels that lead borrowers to mistake substance for form. Then, Colin introduces his alternate currency, Deror, an honor based system that can be understood by looking at ancient Cuneiform record keeping, which used a bartering system of IOUs overseen by central authorities such as temple priests. He lays out how the algorithm works on the concept of a triangular balance sheet, with credits on one side, debts on another, and an honor rating at the top, and he gives examples of the exchange as a social interaction based on trust. Colin says the idea behind this system is that everyone is able to be a “money god” with infinite potential to create money. Later, we look at the idea that Bitcoin shares similar problems with conventional money in that its worth is based in a value that can be increased through saving rather than spending. At the end, Colin illuminates the occult concept of expanding or lengthening balance sheets as a metaphor for the power of lenders over those they manipulate.

Title: P䲠֢erg, Robin Palmblad & Emil Hagberg - The Nordic Resistance Movement - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Clebyx78I94
Description: Pär Öberg is Chief of the Parliamentary branch of the Nordic Resistance Movement and is a city council member in Ludvika, a small town in Dalarna, Sweden. He is also the spokesman of the organization in Swedish media and one of three permanent hosts of Radio Nordfront. Robin Palmblad was born Malmö, Sweden and has been politically active for 16 years, first as a nationalist and later as a national socialist. He is the founder of Radio Nordfront, a podcast broadcasted by the Swedish branch of the Nordic Resistance Movement. Emil Hagberg has been a national activist in Sweden for over 15 years. Formerly “Nästeschef” (Nest Chief) for Stockholm, he is a member of the Nordic Resistance Council, which includes Resistance Movements in Norway, Denmark and Finland. 

Pär, Robin and Emil are with us to discuss their involvement in the Nordic Resistance Movement and the paths that led each of them to embrace National Socialist ideology. Robin summarizes the 9 points of the NRM’s goals and visions, which focus on stopping mass immigration, reconquering power from the global Zionist elite and creating a self-sufficient Nordic state with strong involvement and influence of the people, a citizen-owned mass media, and a modern society living in harmony with the natural order. We consider the demonized version of national socialism that has been propagandized by Hollywood, and the influence that the social policies from the 3rd Reich had on Swede’s glory days prior to WWII. We look at how the economic system of Germany in the 1930s and 40s was free from the Rothschild banking system, and why this independence posed a major threat to the Zionist agenda. Emil illustrates the destructive nature of the privatized, super-capitalist state system of Sweden that is usurping tax revenues to fund the country’s cultural annihilation through mass immigration programs. We learn how asylum centers and homes are financed through classified contracts with Zionist lenders and forcibly established by the Swedish migration agency. We also discuss the problem of Islam in Sweden and the Zionist infiltration of the Sweden Democrats. 

In the members’ half, we get into the static and consistent attacks that the NRM has received from the liberal-controlled Swedish media, and the guys give a clear picture of the absurd hate speech laws that are used to make political prisoners out of activists endorsing national socialism. We discuss the freemasonic flavor of the courts, the Wallenberg banking family, and the incestuous relationships within the political establishment and the media. Then, we weigh up the many ways multiculturalism is eroding the most vulnerable populations of Sweden, along with the special allowances provided to immigrants and the evil entrepreneurs who profit from their infestation. The fellows talk about the strategies of NRM and what they are doing to awaken, organize and mobilize the citizens of Sweden to counter this grim situation. They give examples of how the treasonous government relentlessly acts against the will of the people and seeks to prevent any kind of organized opposition, and we look hopefully to the many strong indications that the ordinary majority is beginning to recognize its true enemies. Pär emphasizes the value of building a solid organizational structure with members who can maintain positions within the existing political system and law enforcement. Our conversation ends on best strategies for the pro-White movement and establishing a doctrine that promises a victorious future for Swedes.

Title: Blonde in the Belly of the Beast - Feminist Mania & Libtard Youth - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-04-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MSL1d6D5L9I
Description: Blonde in the Belly of the Beast is an anti-feminist, anti-cultural Marxism, pro-free speech, anti-Islam, pro-guns, right-leaning libertarian woman living in the Seattle. 

Blonde in the Belly of the Beast joins us for our first ever video version of Radio 3Fourteen, available only for members. The audio version is available to everyone. We'll discuss the commentaries she has been broadcasting via her YouTube channel. We learn about some of her encounters with the run-of-the-mill liberal population of the Pacific NW, where effeminate men, 3rd wave feminists, and social justice warriors reign and women with conservative values are exceptionally rare. Blonde talks about how she came to realize the flaws of liberalism and feminism, and we try to define what it really means to be a feminist in Western society. We touch on the flimsy argument that gender difference is a social construct by looking at the transgender trend and the disparities seen between mothers with careers and stay-at-home moms. Blonde goes on to explain some of her views on the MGTOW scene and the culture of victimization that has divided the sexes. Then, she describes her firsthand experience of the refugee crisis in Europe and relates how Americans are truly blind to the culturally corrosive poison of Islam. Later, we size up the latest destructive manifestation of feminism, the body-positive movement, along with the ills of sexual liberation and the disturbing implications of abortion on demand. At the end, Blonde reveals some of the prickly topics she plans to tackle in future videos.

Title: Frank Raymond - The Caucasian Mind: Transcending Biological Needs - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=uEP0294BhLI
Description: Frank Raymond was born in the Indian subcontinent and spent his early life in Calcutta, Darjeeling, and Dhaka in Bangladesh. He went to college and university in England, and later returned to Bangladesh, where he spent many years running an industrial business and immersing himself in the mind and culture of the people of India. For the past 20+ years Raymond has resided in Vancouver, BC, and due to witnessing the slow destruction of the once-proud Canada, he was inspired to write his first book, “Sweet Dreams and Terror Cells.” 

Frank returns to Red Ice to expand upon his unique outsider’s insight into the workings of the White mind and culture. He begins with an overview of some distinguishing traits of the Caucasian mind-soul, focusing on the special love for animals that is marked in their desire to protect and preserve nature. Frank goes into the first two of what he considers to be the five main elements of the Caucasian mind, beginning with the ability to transcend beyond immediate biological needs to pay attention to immaterial realities and goals. He gives examples of the “energy conservation constraint,” a subconscious drive that prevents many other cultures from indulging in leisurely activities, exploring, or exertions of intellect that would deter from addressing the more practical demands of life. We discuss the theme of the underdog rising to the top that is commonly depicted in Bollywood movies, along with the Hollywood formula of celebrating mediocrity, and how these ideals reflect a time constraint for creativity. Frank makes several points about the tinkering/inventing-type hobbies that are popular amongst White folk as being indicators of another one of the main Caucasian mind characteristics, which is the ability to transcend beyond the present reality to study or ruminate on the abstract. 

In the members’ segment, Frank continues explaining the five mind elements and illustrates how the study of abstract mathematics such as calculus has distinguished White Europeans as being free from the energy conservation constraint. Then, we discuss the phenomenon of what Frank calls “the forest mind” – an awareness of and connection to nature that gives Caucasians a distinctive concern for and feeling of responsibility to the greater collective of planetary life. Then, we look at the exceptional knack for open displays of happiness, the unique biopsychic drive of taking part in joyful activities like singing in a choir or dancing for pleasure, and the transcendent child mind that sets Europeans apart from more serious cultures. Frank goes on to delineate another major difference of the White mind in that there is a unique appetite for exploring the realms of science fiction, time and space travel, and pushing the boundaries of civilization’s advancement. He theorizes that the emergence of differentiated sub-species of humans can perhaps be explained through an other-worldly evolutionary adaptation to life on earth. He notes that the idea of moving through time and parallel dimensions of the universe is a pervasive theme throughout Caucasian mythology. At the end, Frank introduces Shane Douglas, the protagonist of “Sweet Dreams and Terror Cells, who is considered to be a dangerous radical in the eyes of the Mind Masters and Sneak Rulers for seeking to protect and preserve his extraordinary people.

Title: John Morgan - Esotericism on the Right & Plague of Modernity - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PaSoxwL3Mcs
Description: John Morgan was one of the founders and is Editor-in-Chief of Arktos Media, a publisher which has established itself as the leading outlet for the European ‘New Right’ school of thought in English, and has published many other books relevant to the dissident Right and traditionalism more generally. Morgan is also co-editor at the new Right On website. He currently resides in Budapest, Hungary. 

John returns to Red Ice to engage in an assessment of the modern Rightist discourse in Western Europe and the US. He begins with an overview of his intellectual and spiritual journey through esotericism, the occult, existentialism, philosophy, and ancient mythology, which eventually connected him to the conservative revolution of the European Right. We discuss the deeply fractured state of Western civilization that seems to stem from a disjointed awareness of heritage and tradition and lack of spiritual veneration. We consider how this lost kinship has primed the conditions for Islam, whose strength lies in a deeply rooted belief system extending beyond pragmatic politics, to again descend upon the West. John sights this escalating conflict as a deep urge within the human psyche to seek out the authentic and go beyond the prescribed programming of this era of material prosperity and egocentricity. Then, John talks about his first years in business with Integral Tradition Publishing in India, a venture that materialized out of his rejection of modernity with its inherent nihilism and a desire for a broader understanding of the enduring culture and identity of the East. 

In the members’ hour, John shares how he ended up in Hungary with the new incarnation of his publishing company, Arktos Media. We get a glimpse into the uniquely traditional characteristics of Hungarian culture, its resistance to globalization, and the leadership of Victor Orban that has been very outspoken against the current invasion of Europe. John talks about Hungary’s 2014 election, which resulted in 45% of the votes for moderate right party Fidesz ad 25% for the more radical right party Jobbik. He touches on the basic rejection of liberalism and interest in traditionalism that both parties represent, and addresses accusations that Jobbik harbors “anti-Semitic” sentiments. Further, John makes some comparisons between Jobbik’s strongly socialist, anti-capitalistic stance and the greatly conflicting picture of socialism in America. We look at the significance of spirituality in serious traditionalist subcultures like Fidesz and Jobbik and how this differs greatly in the ideological focus of Western Europe’s mainstream Right. Then, we analyze the extreme emphasis that has been placed on IQ scores and genetics by White Nationalists of the American Alt-Right, and we explore how Europeans across the board can embrace a sense of cultural identity and pride without getting hung up solely on race. At the end, we address how to engage in the metapolitical battle to redefine and restore Western culture.

Title: Mike King - The British Mad Dog: Debunking the Myth of Winston Churchill - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2d2a0QrfgEk
Description: Mike King is a private investigative journalist and researcher based in the New York City area. A 1987 graduate of Rutgers University, King's subsequent 27-year career in Marketing & Advertising has equipped him with a unique perspective when it comes to understanding how "public opinion" is scientifically manufactured. Mike is the author of over a dozen books, including “Planet Rothschild,” “Mein Side of the Story” and “The Bad War” and he is the editor of TomatoBubble.com. 

Mike joins us for another revealing episode of unraveling the lies, omitted truths, propaganda and brainwashing that have shaped the hearts and minds of Western civilization. Our discussion focuses on the subject of King’s latest book, “The British Mad Dog: Debunking the Myth of Winston Churchill.” We begin with a look into the English blueblood family that was prominent in high society and politics for 250 years before the man championed as “The British Bulldog” was produced. Mike touches on Churchill’s early upbringing in military boarding schools as the son of an abusive, distant father and NYC socialite mother, and grandson of the “King of Wall Street.” We learn about his years as a highly paid English war correspondent, entry into British parliament, and his swift appointment on the eve of the great war as the First Lord of the British Admiralty. Then, Mike explains Churchill’s role in the German hunger blockade of WWI, a key point when it became clear he was playing in the globalist Zionist game. He characterizes the reckless and psychopathic behavior that Churchill became known for, most notably his perpetual drunkenness and indebtedness, poor political strategies, his part in the catastrophic 1926 crash of the British economy, and a callous disregard for human life. Mike also covers the “Wilderness Years,” when Churchill was banished from politics, and his return to power that was financed by the same Jewish billionaires who were angling for a war with Germany. 

In the members’ segment, Mike talks about Churchill’s tarnished reputation with the British public and how he managed to rise once again despite being booted from his position as Prime Minister. We look at the outset of WWII when bloodthirsty Churchill was at the forefront of engineering and deliberately provoking the bombing of his own country by the Germans. Further, Mike discusses Hitler’s appeals to Britain and attempts for peace agreements to stop the ensuing war, and his response to the indiscriminate carpet bombings of German civilians that were propagandized to the hilt, solidifying the demonization of National Socialist Germany. Later, we get into the vindictive orchestration of the 1943 Bengal famine that coincided with India’s fight for independence, of which Churchill was fiercely against. Then, we look at one of the most enduring myths of WWII – the purported looting of fine art across Germany and Europe by the Nazis. Mike illustrates Hitler’s veneration for art, architecture and heritage and his foresight to save the cultural treasures that would have been destroyed by the Allied Forces in their barbaric bombing crusades, which targeted neutral, friendly and even allied countries. At the end, we consider the psychological warfare that continues whipping Germany into submission in the latest chapter of demoralization known as the Kalergi Plan.

Title: Oscar Turner - OmniPhi: Visual Aesthetics in Media Production
Date: 2016-04-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=66Hm14Mbfm0
Description: Oscar Turner is the creator of Omniphi Media and for the past couple years has been producing, editing and narrating videos that challenge the corrupt mainstream media coalition who seek the genetic and cultural annihilation of the European people. Oscar’s work is dense with rich graphics and animations, with notable productions such as “The European Giant,” “Voice of Europe,” and “Dr. William L. Pierce – Conditioning for Death.” 

In this discussion, Oscar describes how he became interested in the backstories of history and countering the deliberately destructive role of the mass media in American society. We learn how an 8th grade reading assignment on the holocaust prompted Oscar to question the accepted narrative of the history books and led him to the discovery of inspirational men like William Pierce, David Duke and Kai Murros. We talk about the dominating forces in Hollywood responsible for promoting a lefty ‘counter culture’ fueled by degeneracy and a hatred for America’s European ancestry since the 60s, and we look at ways to build the rising right momentum that is directed towards reinvigorating a more traditional, nationalistic narrative. Oscar delves into his creative process of video making and his goals for reaching a wider audience through addressing issues that inform on both politics and White identity. We consider the types of internet personalities who are able to appeal to the hyperactive pace of the millennials, and we weigh up some of the characters who have tried to infiltrate and tarnish the true positioning of the alternative right. Then, Oscar touches on some of his experiences with the transhumanism movement and he points out how these forward thinking visionaries may be a godsend if the west is fully seized by a hostile, non-white majority. In closing, Oscar gives some tips for getting into video production and how we can gear our energy towards a new renaissance of culture creation.

Title: Tough Love, Mammon, Aussie Tory & Gustav - The Plight and Fight in Australia & New Zealand - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Uqs4M2D91_c
Description: Tough Love is a New Zealander of European descent who writes a blog of original articles and creative writings that focus on White identity and the bi-cultural experience. Aussie Tory is an aspiring academic in his mid-twenties who has been involved in Nationalist, New Right and traditionalist circles for close to a decade. He currently writes at thedingoes.xyz and is a regular on "The Convict Report" podcast. Mammon is a young lad from Australia, co-host of the Convict Report and co-editor of The Dingoes. During his time at university he became disillusioned by the hostile, anti-Western rhetoric and chose to get involved in securing the interest of our people and the preservation of the Australian Nation. Gustav is an Australian man in his late 20's who has had an active interest in political philosophy and economics from a young age. He was 'red-pilled' by the New Right in late 2013 and has been increasingly involved in the scene since last year through blogging and networking. 

In this program, we take a look at the general state of Australia and New Zealand in relation to multiculturalism, immigration, and the similar displacement that is happening in Europe and North America. We discuss the rise of Islam in Australia, peppered with a series of attacks on Whites, and the response by MSM and government that painted the native population as racist for showing resistance to the boorish behavior. We look at how the installation of the AU Fabian Society in the late 1940s and the change of immigration policies in the 70s ushered in an era of multicultural growth pronounced by a heavy advancement of Asians. Gustav explains the new vision of AU history that took shape during the 60s, which labeled the country’s founding by the British monarchy as a great injustice and theft of land and solidified the grand narrative of evil white oppressors. Tough Love talks about New Zealand’s Maori population and its skewed aboriginal history that claims large swaths of land and immaterial rights as belonging to the tribe, and he illustrates how the excuse of systemic racism has been used to congeal a robust reparations industry for the deteriorating population. We also consider the new colonization that is taking place Down Under, where the world’s highest immigration rates are quickly transforming demographics, driving up real estate rates, bottlenecking the job market, and brandishing increased crime and violence. 

In the members’ half, we analyze the circumstances that have led to the anti-white agenda and decline in nationalist pride in AU and NZ. The Dingoes talk about the greater Asianization of the sister countries, designed to secure inclusion in the globalist economy, and fueling a renewed national impetus due to the stagnation of wages and a shift away from traditional society. We learn about the government’s Treaty Tribunal and its many versions of tribal laws that have allowed for fuzzy interpretations and an expanding resource ownership management scheme that resembles an apartheid takeover. Then, we get into the recent move to modify the AU national flag, mulling over the hostility towards European heritage and potential destruction of patriotic values that the failed initiative represented. Aussie Tory helps us distinguish what a true Australia really looks like, and why hostile invaders pose an awful threat to a pure reflection of the European diaspora’s spirit that built up the country. At the end, Mammon addresses the sad disdain Europeans have toward their place in society as the thrust for multicultural inclusion continues, and we reflect on Mother Europa’s looming disintegration and her vulnerable areas of the world that may not have a future without the solidarity of all of Western civilization’s branches.

Title: David Whitehead - Embracing The Warrior in a Culture of Victimhood - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-04-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=iiugCH91wnQ
Description: David Whitehead is a full time Martial Arts instructor and entrepreneur, a coach in the holistic health and wellness field, and conducts professional seminars and workshops in Canada and around the world. He gives in-depth presentations on his unique perspective on the warrior archetype, and shares his ideas on the many modern day applications of this ancient warrior philosophy for individual and societal empowerment. David is an avid adventurer and independent researcher, and runs his own podcast show called ‘Truth Warrior.’ 

David joins us for a discussion about the way of the warrior who incorporates the pursuit of truth while staying open to new information and mastering the art of personal refinement. He points to control of overall physical, spiritual and emotional wellbeing as key to becoming a fully realized being in this often malevolent world, and this requiring serious discipline, flexibility and adaptability to perform at an optimal level. David talks about the importance of balanced exploration into the physical and spiritual dimensions of life, and he explains how martial arts is a practical, hands-on way to realize this equilibrium. We delve into victimhood and avoiding responsibility as means to give away personal power, and David illustrates the ways honing a warrior philosophy can help boost confidence and aid in personal growth. We also touch on the idea that being connected to one’s ancestors and roots and having a healthy understanding of the uniquely different cultures that comprise the human family is paramount in any fully functioning society. Further, we get into the disappearance of the hero archetype and the replacement of the ubermensch with the underdog as key indicators of a cultural decay. Also discussed is the proper use of violence, conveying a stature of confidence as a means of self-defense, and the importance of children being allowed to experience struggle in self-realization. We round things off by looking at the function of moral codes and living a disciplined life, and David gives some solid advice for taking up the study of martial arts.

Title: Frank Jorge - Obama's Symbolic Visit to Cuba - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=x_3N1i1pD1k
Description: Frank Jorge is an American who was born in Guantanamo, Cuba in 1950. He immigrated to the USA in 1957 under a normal, non-refugee Visa process with his parents and sister and was raised in California where he became active as a Minuteman against illegal immigration. Jorge is a retired electronic technician and host of Frank and Friends Internet Radio Show. 

In this program we get Frank’s take on President Obama’s recent historical trip to Cuba and his symbolic, propaganda-filled speech that illuminated yet another merge towards the globalist agenda. Frank talks about the conditions in Cuba that prompted his parents to flee the country in its last couple of years under the dictatorial rule of Batista. We trace over the rebel uprising and Cuban revolution that propelled Fidel Castro to power, launching an era of communist command, miserable poverty, and civil unrest that extends to this day. Frank gives an assessment of the communist origins of Obama’s political career, his relationship to the Islamic State, and his ties to special interest radicals like the Black Panthers. We touch on the anti-White lamenting that saturated Obama’s Cuban address and played perfectly in to the war on Europeans that has been building steam since the Civil Rights movement. Further, we consider the correlation between black emancipation and social unrest in the US, looking at the brainwashing propaganda that has been programming citizens to abandon natural impulses to self-segregate. We also put focus on the disingenuous narrative of racial discrimination that points the finger at whitey for the failure of blacks to integrate within a European governance system. Then, we look at how Obama’s lifting of the trade embargo on Cuba essentially brings the US one step closer to fully embracing its communist underpinnings that have been thinly disguised as democracy. 

In the members’ half, Frank makes some predictions for Cuba’s future in the global market and how the cash-strapped country will adapt after decades of pinched freedoms. We take stock of how the transnational mechanism manages to herd 3rd world populations into the West while gobbling up the middle class and stimulating profits for the world elite. Frank talks about the detrimental effects of multiculturalism on countries like Brazil, and we look at how the faulty premises of equality go against the grain of ethnically homogenous societies. We tie this in to the US’s increasing problems with violence and crime amongst minority groups, along with the effects that drastically changing demographics have had on the morale of disenfranchised Europeans. Then, we get into the forthcoming US presidential election and Trump’s symbolism as the country’s last-ditch effort to salvage the dream of its European forefathers. We discuss the conditions that have resulted in America’s dwindling sense of nationalism, including the establishment’s ceaseless warmongering and meddling in the Middle East, its failure to protect cultural cohesion and borders, and now the threat of dirty bombs being imported by Muslim extremists. Moreover, we try to pin down the fundamental rationale for the US’s undying pledge of allegiance to Israel, and we close with thoughts on the synchronicity of events in the West that point to a plot of White genocide.

Title: Rob Kievsky - Mastering High-Investment Parenting & Building a Merchant Guild - Hour 1
Date: 2016-04-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=CGQunpu0Lww
Description: Rob Kievsky is an intellectual specializing in the theory and practice of finding, describing, and correcting the deficits or the major problems of our modern lives. He is a business owner and family man who identifies as a White Nationalist and he seeks to positively influence others who share his path. 

Rob joins us for a discussion about two matters he deems to be crucial for a successful White Nationalist movement: mastering high-investment child rearing and building a merchant guild. We first look into the forms of warfare we are faced with in this current era, which are designed to arrest the finances, minds and culture of working-class America while lining the pockets of globalist elites. Rob talks about the need for Americans to adopt a merchant mentality by investing in small businesses and creating cohesive networks of commerce operated by and benefiting likeminded folk and families. He emphasizes the importance of investigating ventures and proper business building, along with minimizing mistakes by learning “trade secrets and cheat codes” from industry insiders. We also look at the value of owning a family-run business that allows for high investment parenting, and raising kids with minimal TV exposure. 

In the members’ segment, we address how to bring up children who are capable of resisting influences from our incompetent, degenerate enemies, and Rob describes some of his parenting strategies. Then, Rob illustrates the inspiration and insight he has gained from reading spy memoirs, speaking to the importance of shifting one’s mentality in order to gather useful tactics from adversaries. He gives examples of using this approach in the business world. Later, we get into the effect that Trump is having on the shifting Overton window and America’s crumbling politically correct mold. We also discuss the left’s utter lunacy and its swift descent into self-destruct mode, and we look at ways to take advantage of civilization’s unhinged state. At the end, we take stock of how we can step up to the plate and make good use of the massive cultural awakening being stirred by the overplayed liberal hand.

Title: Greg Johnson - Straight But Not Narrow Nationalism: Gays, Women & The Manosphere
Date: 2016-03-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NWt5Cz6ngLI
Description: Greg Johnson is Editor-in-Chief of Counter Currents. He is the author of "Confessions of a Reluctant Hater," "New Right vs. Old Right," and the newly published “Truth, Justice, & a Nice White Country.” 

Greg is with us to address the wave of “gay panic” that has recently swept through the Alt Right scene, along with the static surrounding the role of women and the legitimacy of the manosphere within the Nationalist movement. We discuss accusations that men are overrepresented in the Alt Right and implications that the involvement of more women is needed to dispel the gay rumor. Then, we look at the manosphere-type jerks that fuel the irrelevancy of this feminist blame game by denigrating the women who are actually adding value to the cause with solid contributions. Greg expands upon his stance that White Nationalism should be “straight, but not narrow,” pointing out that upholding the biological norms of sexual differentiation and the heterosexual family includes respecting people who may deviate from the standards, yet stand true to the policies of racial integrity. We also get into the transgender phenomenon, homophobia, the Christian notion of original sin, marriage ethics, declining White birth rates, and the feminization of heterosexual men. Greg speaks to the morally corrupt credos of the manosphere, and why women are attracted to the “dark triad traits” of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and sociopathy. Further, we consider how actualizing the capacity for excellence within society involves being realistic about shameful behavior and nihilistic traits that undermine healthy norms. Our conversation rounds off with a look at the main political absolutes of White advocacy and what it means to be an authentic vanguardist.

Title: Jan Ott - Oera Linda Book: An Ancient Frisian Manuscript - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kflHJpB9f1s
Description: Jan Ott was born and raised in rural Westfriesland in North-Holland, and later settled in Germany. In 2009 he began studying the Oera Linda Book (OLB), a controversial Frisian manuscript that became well known in the 1870s and had a revival in the 1930s. He has been blogging about the OLB since 2011 and made a one-hour video in English, German, Dutch, Norse and Frisian, debunking the main claims of the hoax-theory. Ott is working on a new English translation, which will be published together with a new transliteration and scans of all 190 pages. 

Jan joins us to discuss his extensive research into the fascinating language and content of the Oera Linda Book, a story that begins in the 6th century BC and contains information predating 1500 BC. The manuscript first surfaced in 1867, when third-generation shipbuilder Cornelis Over de Linden enlisted a Frisian history and language research society to assist in deciphering and translating the ancient text. Jan explains the heated controversy that surrounded the 1872 publication of the translation, which came at an unstable period in European history and greatly upset the centuries-old established belief system. We learn about the structure of the Old Frisian alphabet, said to have been created by the mythological folk mother, Frya and based on the six-spoke wheel, the JOL or yule, a sacred symbol representing time, eternity and perfection, as well as the origin of everything. Jan talks about the main components of the book, including two letters of warning addressed to descendants of the book’s creators, corresponding names from ancient Nordic, Germanic and Greek mythology, mention of a Golden Age devastated by a cataclysmic geological shift and a great flood, and movements of Caucasians throughout the northern hemisphere. 

In the members’ segment, we discuss the time frame during the 1930s political uprising of National Socialism when the OLB resurfaced with renewed interest and more rejection by official scientists. Jan explains SS leader Heinrich Himmler’s interest in the book, its connection to Indo-Aryan/European culture, and the creation myth that describes how the three main races (white, yellow and black) would have descended from three primal mothers. We consider the various sets of laws contained within the book that are typically frowned upon today by Whites who are instilled with a sense of self-hatred and lost identity. Then, Jan gets into the long history of connections and splits between Germanic and northwest Indian tribes, and we look at the role migration has played in shifting around various cultural and linguistic elements within northern Europe. We end by weighing up the current Western political power structure that actively dismisses, demonizes and destroys anything that may strengthen a sense of belongingness, identity and veneration for the amazing ancient European world and its ancestors.

Title: Nick Griffin & Jack Sen - The Battle for the Future of Europe - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=djdGnPLXZkU
Description: Nick Griffin, described at various times as "the most dangerous man in British politics" and "the most successful far-right leader in British history," has been active in radical nationalist politics since he joined the National Front in 1974 at the age of 15. In 2009 he was elected as a member of the European Parliament while leader of the British National Party. Mr. Griffin is now Vice-President of the pan-European Alliance for Peace and Freedom and Political Adviser to the British Unity Party. 

Jack Sen was the United Kingdom Independence Party's (UKIP) prospective Member of Parliament for West Lancashire before being unceremoniously, and quite publicly, suspended. Jack then served the British National Party as its North West spokesman in 2015, but stepped down to concentrate on his British Renaissance Policy Institute and finish his book, “How to Get Suspended from UKIP and the BNP in 10 Articles and 2 Tweets.” 

Nick and Jack discuss their current political engagement and the series of films that BRPI is producing to document the work of British and American Nationalists and create a permanent public record unsullied by the warped and inaccurate accounts of the anti-European establishment and its controlled media. We sum up the main concerns being addressed by genuine Nationalists, including the Islamification of Western Europe and the overarching state of dispossession the indigenous population is experiencing. Jack and Nick explain how the White birth rate decline transpired at the same time as 2nd wave feminism, and we look deeper into the deliberately provoked, divisional force of this anti-male hysteria. We also talk about the Zionist thrust to create a multicultural mishmash out of the West, and the issue of popular alt-news outlets glossing over the relationship between immigration and the rise of terrorism and everyday violence. We touch on the turf wars going on inside the Muslim faction within Europe, and how attacks by radical terrorism networks are fueling more cause for the federalization of the European police force. Then, Nick and Jack outline the APF’s objectives and its metapolitical mission to shift the Overton window to the right. 

For the members’ segment, we focus on the steps that must be taken to turn around the ailing state of England and Europe at large, which involves a bit of a debate over the viability of the current political system. Nick illustrates the sheer corruption and manipulation that surrounds the election process, and he describes his infamous Question Time lynching on the BBC that surprisingly resulted in a quadrupling of the BNP’s poll ratings. Then, we look to the possibility of a European civil war erupting and the feasibility of an armed resistance by average citizens with an aversion to firearms and, conversely, the muslim population that is infatuated by and fully loaded with advanced weaponry. Later, we discuss how Europe can rid itself of the liberal, cultural Marxist, SJW infection that has stolen the pride and identity of its people, and we consider how renewed ethnic cohesion can reinvigorate a desire for young people to have children and stand by traditional family values.

Title: James Edwards - Racism Schmacism: Trump & "White Supremacy" - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-03-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Eosxodif_iI
Description: ames Edwards is the founding host of The Political Cesspool, an award-winning talk show broadcast on AM radio in the US. Mr. Edwards has appeared as a commentator numerous times on television and his work on the radio has been the subject of articles in over 250 of the most prominent newspaper and magazine publications around the world. James has been named an “Honorary City Councilman” in Memphis, Tennessee, where his show has received a certificate of recognition for outstanding contribution to the community. His first book, “Racism, Schmacism” was released in 2010. 

James joins us for a look into some trending topics concerning race, politics and hypocrisy in America, of which he has been covering “the other side” of for eleven years at TPC. We begin with James detailing the circumstances of his recent Tennessee Trump rally coverage - an event that grabbed him national MSM attention and characterized his particular flavor of pro-White as “White supremacist.” We discuss the passionate climate that surrounds any gathering of Trump supporters, drawn chiefly by the issues of illegal immigration, the new Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, and giving the flip to political correctness. We also consider the magical spell of the word “racist” that has kept most conservative Americans silent about the 3rd world transformation of their once unified nation. We also get into Trump’s stance on Israel and his place on the warmonger scale, and we consider the politics that have infected all facets of the American establishment since the 50s. At the end, James illustrates the hypocrisy of the Confederate flag fiasco and the billionaire-funded #blacklivesmatter campaign, along with the epicness of American patriots that have united throughout history to preserve European culture and values.

Title: Matthew Bracken - Brussels Attacks Islams European Offensive is Only Beginning - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=fZ4Pydl2c6s
Description: Matt Bracken was born in 1957 in Baltimore, Maryland, and graduated from the University of Virginia in 1979 with a degree in Russian Studies. He was commissioned as a Naval officer and served on east coast SEAL teams during the 1980s as a Special Warfare officer, including leading a SEAL detachment to Beruit, Lebanon in 1983. He has worked as a boat builder, welder, and charter boat skipper, and holds a Coast Guard captain's license. Bracken is the author of several books, including “Enemies Foreign and Domestic,” which is also the name of his website that features a collection of essays, social commentary and short fiction. 

Matt joins us on the heels of the Brussels terror attack to help put in perspective the complexity and seriousness of the problems we face with the Islamic invasion of Europe. Matt has written an important essay, “Tet, Take Two: Islam’s 2016 European Offensive,” which details how three great social forces – Islam, international socialism, and nationalism – have been set in motion to collide in a monumental showdown comparable to WWI and WWII. We discuss how Belgium became the new hotbed for the Muslim Brotherhood, allowing a 1,400-year old Islamic quest for global conquest incubate inside the heart of Europe. We go over some details of the capture of the ringleader of the Nov 2015 Paris attacks, Salah Abdeslam, in Brussels just days before the latest attacks, and we sort out how the traitorous globalist socialist elite are using the Muslim invasion and its ensuing chaos as a weapon against their own European people. 

In the members’ hour, Matt plainly illustrates that there will be no deporting or assimilating of the Muslims already within Europe, and due to the failure of the EU’s Schengen Zone, there will be no stopping the flooding in of millions more “refugees.” He emphasizes how this infiltration will undoubtedly lead to more bombings, more no-go zones, and a major problem for police if our modern technological infrastructure comes under attack. We consider the great brainwashing that has been inflicted upon the altruistic people of the West by the MSM regarding the true demographics of the invasion and the numerous other attacks and aggressions that aren’t being covered, and we talk about Donald Trump’s ability to appeal to Americans by tearing the veil off the root cause of some of the US’s most serious crime issues. Matt also covers what can be expected as we see more refugee centers within Europe become clogged with Muslim men that are hell bent on making Hijrah, or Jihad by migration.

Title: Amelia Raath - Radical AntiWhite Marxism in South Africa - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-03-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PG3fp7AAafQ
Description: Amelia Raath is an Afrikaner of Dutch and German descent, born in South Africa and currently residing in Bloemfontein in the Free State. Amelia obtained a BA degree in Fine Arts at University of the Free State, specializing in Drawing and Painting, and then earned a certificate in Health Coaching from The Institute for Integrative Nutrition. 

Amelia is with us to offer her perspective on the social climate of South Africa and illustrate the conditions that influenced her awakening to the White genocide agenda. We begin with a glimpse into Amelia’s upbringing at an Afrikaner Christian girls’ school and an all-girls university. She talks about her struggles with finding sustainable employment opportunities and how her derailed state of health led her to a major lifestyle change and the pursuit of a career in health coaching. Amelia discusses her “waking up” and the rediscovery of her ancient Germanic and Nordic roots, along with the realization of the deep brainwashing that teaches Afrikaners to hate their own race. We talk about the lies and double standards instilled at liberal universities that endorse ethnic cleansing of Whites and reinforce the distorted push for affirmative action. Amelia details some of the protests and chaos instigated by disgruntled blacks on campuses in South Africa, and she describes how the media continually portrays White supremacy as the culprit for the deficiencies of the African majority. Furthermore, we look at the culture clashing tactics of the Economic Freedom Fighters, along with the racially prejudiced policies of the African National Congress, which together yield an impossible climate for Afrikaners to defend their existence in post-Apartheid South Africa. At the end, Amelia shares some inspiration for Europeans to honor their diverse and remarkable cultures, and she highlights some key ingredients for strong and balanced health.

Title: Sencha MacRae - The Russian Bolshevik Revolution - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-03-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=xaF28yBSCTY
Description: Sencha MacRae is behind UntoldTales.net, a website that is dedicated to turning stories around and revealing the untold history of the European people. 

Sencha joins us to discuss some of the hidden facts and blatant lies she has been working to expose at Untold Tales. She begins by talking about how she got interested in the 1917 Russian Revolution and the stories surrounding the idealized Bolsheviks. We consider how slanted Western journalism have spun glossy tales of the Bolshevik Coup and marginalized the horrific reality of the tens of millions of Ukrainian and Russian peasant farmers genocided by starvation and brutal murder. Sencha touches on the brutal massacre of Russia’s royal Tsar Nicholas and family, ordered by Lenin, that led to WWI and the mass transformation of the state apparatus as the Jewish elite slid into control of the Communist regime and Christians were targeted for elimination. Then, we look at the current American version of communism manifested in the forms of endless media programming, political correctness, cheap consumer goods and junk food. Later, we weigh up how Trump is tapping into the burgeoning frustration and resentment of Americans that are feeling debased by insane foreign policies, a crumbling economy, and an American dream that is becoming a 3rd world nightmare.

Title: Matt Forney - r/K Selection Theory: The Evolutionary Psychology Behind Politics - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=csrrOqPtycU
Description: Matt Forney is an author, journalist and entrepreneur currently based in Chicago. A native of Syracuse, New York, he has lived in Canada as well as the Philippines, and studied English and journalism at SUNY Plattsburgh and the University at Albany. Forney is a columnist for Return of Kings and Right On, and blogs regularly at his website MattForney.com. Additionally, he is the author of the self-help guide “Confessions of an Online Hustler” and several other books. 

Matt returns to Red Ice for a discussion about the subject matter of the book by Anonymous Conservative, “The Evolutionary Psychology Behind Politics.” He explains the concept from evolutionary biology known as the r/K selection theory, and how this relates to the evolution of liberalism (r-strategist) vs. conservatism (K-strategist). By comparing the mating strategies of wolves and rabbits in the wild, we can see how politics is really a conflict between the K-strategist wolves, who are genetically predisposed to high-investment parenting and fierce competition in a world of scarce resources, and the r-strategist rabbits, who are designed to freely and carelessly graze on abundant resources while rapidly multiplying in numbers to exploit such a glut. Matt describes the way civilizations tend to swing back and forth between the two strategies depending on the availability of resources, and he relates how we are currently seeing a major tipping point from r to K selection. We tie this theory in with present day rape statistics, the right to bear arms, martial law, gangs, racial relations, gender roles, politics, and more. We also address narcissism, the dominant personality disorder of our time, and the role this plays in the manipulation of the K-selected by the r-strategists. 

In the members’ segment, we make an assessment of how the r/K selection theory is manifesting in the Trump phenomenon, where we are seeing a major polarization of two opposing American ideologies. We consider how Trump’s open advocating of nationalist policies is reflecting the sentiments of average marginalized citizens who are fed up with the globalist agenda and all the progressive, politically correct bulls#!t. Matt emphasizes how Trump is threatening the entire con of the establishment with his unapologetic grandiloquence and financial independence, and we talk about the incredible level of lies and propaganda that is being resorted to by the disingenuous media in an effort to derail his burgeoning success. Then, Forney gives a recap of the Chicago Trump rally fiasco, and he gives an appraisal of the chances for Clinton, Sanders and Cruz staying in the presidential race. We also discuss how Trump is appealing to minorities despite his bold stance on illegal immigration. At the end, we take a brief call from “Joe,” a young man who attended the Chicago Trump rally. He gives a play by play account of the chaos and disruption by the Marxist “Reds” that shut down the event, and he illustrates how the lefty media spun their web of lies around the psychotic behavior of the protestors.

Description: Curt Doolittle is an American entrepreneur and author living in Kiev, Ukraine. He is an independent theorist of political economy in the conservative libertarian tradition, and founder of the Propertarian Institute. 

Curt returns to Red Ice to talk about his new declaration for the direction of the New Right, as the time for a revolution is clearly upon us. We begin by looking at the old right’s failed philosophies of equality and democracy, and the fact that Western success isn’t just a product of good virtue, but rather a result of eliminating parasites for thousands of years. Curt declares that we have reached the limit of tolerance for the comforting lies of the establishment, the pseudo-sciences and enlightenment mythos, and we now have permission to tell the truth, which is based in empirical evidence and biological science. We consider how to market the New Right by providing emotionally appealing solutions for the disenfranchised people of the West. Curt emphasizes the need for a government with a market for commons that cannot be monopolized by the lower class and profited on solely by the aristocracy. Then, we discuss Trump’s viability as the new Caesar who will oust bloodsucking politicians from the current US government, clamp down on unrestricted immigration, dissolve federal power, and reinvigorate the production of commons and the American economy. Curt also addresses the benefits of provoking a civil war to create a fear of loss of the expensive commons already in place, and to raise the cost of the status quo so that creating a revolution in order to reach compromise is vital. 

In the members’ half, we weigh up the importance of making this new declaration for the New Right, attacking and replacing the conservative mainstream dialogue, and providing a concrete, relatable ideology for ordinary people. Curt explains why he views force and violence as necessary components in establishing limits for the system and restoring natural order, and he illustrates how traitors in our own ranks have allowed a rampant concentration of mischief and crime filter into European lands with the Muslim invasion. We discuss what it will take to create a constructive movement, put together leadership, and organize skilled people within locales that will put boots on ground to eradicate hostile trespassers. Curt speaks to the practical proof that violence is incredibly useful for resolving conflict, and that mastery of violence is the first and most important aspect for organizing any revolt. He also describes the crucial steps for a proper dethroning of tyrannical government, and we consider how to fund these opportunities, create local networks for recruitment, and work towards producing results that will salvage Western civilization.

Title: Frank Raymond - An Outsider's Insight into the White Mind & Caucasian Culture - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=y--z7SEtypY
Description: Frank Raymond was born in the Indian subcontinent and spent his early life in Calcutta, Darjeeling, and Dhaka in Bangladesh. He went to college and university in England, and later returned to Bangladesh, where he spent many years running an industrial business and immersing himself in the mind and culture of the people of India. For the past 20+ years Raymond has resided in Vancouver, BC, and due to witnessing the slow destruction of the once-proud Canada, he was inspired to write his first book, “Sweet Dreams and Terror Cells.” 

Frank is with us to provide some interesting and unique outsider’s insight into the workings of the White mind and culture. He stands for the principle that every race is irreplaceable and valuable, and he opposes the Cultural Marxist and ‘liberal’ tenet that the white race alone is non-existent and/or evil, worthless and dispensable. Frank describes his motivation for writing the novel, giving various examples of the ‘unique groove’ of the White mind that he sees is taken for granted and at great danger of being lost as the demographics of European lands are being dramatically reshaped through mass immigration. He defines the enemy within the gates as ‘sneak rulers’ who are engineering, through mind control, the genocide of the White race in order to usher in a globalized, identity-less mongrel race. Frank also details some of the stark cultural contrasts of India and the West, underscoring the fact that the Indian people would never allow one inch of their land to be colonized by alien invaders. We discuss evidence that White people are among the best stewards of the earth, and indications that as their numbers diminish, so too shall the safety and social order of the world. Then, Frank speaks to the sense of romance, mystery, and connection to the unknown that is a distinct part of the European folk spirit, and he tells several stories about his encounters with White people that illustrate a dwindling awareness of mythic imagination and ancestral heritage. 

In the members’ segment, we dig deeper into the destructive force of White genocide and the innumerable exceptional traits that will be lost in the displacement of Western civilization and enforcement of multiculturalism. Frank gives more examples of the distinct behaviors of Caucasians and what makes the White mind different from all others. He talks about the sense of humor and the transcendent child mind, along with little idiosyncratic traits like voice pitch and laughter that have been developed over millennia. We also discuss treasured pastimes that are unique to Europeans, such as classical music, bird watching, dog shows and costume parties. Further, Frank describes Whites’ distinct respect and valuation of children, play and storytelling. We end by considering the vast diversity in physical characteristics that exist amongst the wide array of European tribes.

Title: Dr. David Duke - Trump - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0zm1Jg5X3Sk
Description: Dr. David Duke is a graduate of Louisiana State University with a BA in History. He pursued a PhD in the largest university in Ukraine and in 2005 completed his Doctoral Defense in Kiev. Duke is a former member of the House of Representatives from Louisiana and is the author of the books “Jewish Supremacism,” “My Awakening” and “The Secret Behind Communism.”

Dr. Duke, along with Lana from Radio 3Fourteen, joins us to take stock of the extraordinary presidential campaign of Donald Trump and the unprecedented crusade by the controlled media to destroy his reputation and that of his supporters. David addresses the recent attempts by the mainstream news to stump Trump by inaccurately portraying Duke as an endorser and drudging up his 1970s involvement with the KKK, while at the same time ignoring the fact that Bernie Sanders is an openly Zionist, former Trotskyite communist. We look at the symbol of power that Trump has become for disenfranchised Americans as he changes the discourse with his unabashed criticisms on immigration, trade issues, and preserving European American culture. Dr. Duke details where Trump is alienating prospective supporters with some of his more calloused remarks and personal attacks, while at the same time social media stats prove his popularity is soaring. Then, we put some focus on the latest display of “diversity” at its finest at the Chicago Trump rally debacle, and David draws some lines in the sand showing how this kind of insane hypocrisy is normalized by the real racists that are the Zionist oligarchs of banking, media and politics.

In the members' segment, Lana points to some clear indications revealed by the Trump campaign that Whites are craving nationalism, and David makes some points about what our reaction should be to propel the movement and grow ranks. David says voting for Trump should be a strategic move to further the fight to wake up our people about what is at stake in White countries and exposing the evil cabal running the globalist plan to drive racial Europeans to extinction. We talk about the best strategies for educating people on the identity of the Jewish supremacist tribe at the helm of this ethnic cleansing brigade, taking special consideration for ways to reach dedicated Christians who support Zionist Israel. Then, we size up republican candidate Ted Cruz, who his biggest sponsors are, and where the controlled opposition to Trump is getting its millions from. We also touch on the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the rise of communism in America, and Israel’s destruction of Palestine. Later, we hone in on steps to forming a political revolution and the significance of taking part in what will undoubtedly be the most critical presidential election in history.

Title: Walter T. Richmond - "Refugee Crisis" Propaganda: What You're Not Being Told - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-03-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NJCzyCa8x3U
Description: Col. Walter T. Richmond is the penname of the author of the new book, “Hasta la Vista EUROPE!” A member of a military veteran family, Col. Richmond was born and grew up in the US. After graduating basic and officer training at the top of his class, and serving in a variety of emergency, law enforcement, and disaster response capacities, Richmond was commissioned a colonel in the 1990s. He then left uniformed services and worked in various television, radio, communications, and media-related fields. 

Walter first explains his inspiration for writing the book, which was sparked as the insanity of the refugee invasion of Europe was unfolding and he observed a great disparity between what was being portrayed in the mainstream media and the independent videos surfacing on the internet. Walter’s background of specializing in strategic messaging provides a unique perspective on what he calls the “old-fashioned-controlled-media” and his book outlines the tricks that have been used to propagandize the “refugee crisis.” We discuss Chancellor Angela Merkel’s horrible failure at managing the invasion in Germany, and the resulting unprecedented pressure on its health care system, infrastructure, and public services. Richmond outlines some disturbing figures concerning the European housing market and its millions of homeless natives, and the lawlessness that has ensued as special interests groups bend over backwards to provide shelter to migrants. We look at techniques the media is using to craft fairytales about the people of the refugee flood, a disturbing percentage of which are fighting age men and child soldiers with zero education who never intend to assimilate or return to their countries of origin. At the end, Walter emphasizes how EU countries that have been placed on the fast track to multiculturalization are enacting insane policies designed to dismiss and even protect migrant criminals, rapists and murderers while ensuring these savages aren’t unduly offended by ancient European traditions and practices.

Title: Stefan Jacobsson - Facing Sweden's Crisis: Politics, Identity & Culture - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=tjGVxJWauVQ
Description: Stefan Jacobsson, was born and raised in Gothenburg, Sweden. At the age of 16 he joined the now-defunct National Youth (later the Swedish Resistance Movement), and in 2006 he left the organization and worked for several years as an independent Nationalist. Jacobsson became involved with the Party of Swedes (SVP) in 2011, and in 2013 he was unanimously elected as leader of the SVP. The party was dissolved in 2015, and in November he was elected as Secretary General in the Alliance for Peace and Freedom (APF). He is also one of the main figures in Logik Förlag (Logik Publishing). 

Stefan is with us to discuss the Swedish political climate and the collective environment of Sweden as a whole. He begins with some history of the Party of Swedes, the reasons for his decision to close down the party, and what wasn’t working for the movement. Jacobsson sights difficulties in competing with the Sweden Democrats, a party that has notoriously opposed immigration, but has moved to a softer, more politically correct stance. We explore the cultural condition of Sweden, focusing on the conformist mentality of Swedes, and the role that the liberal mainstream media has played in whitewashing the full consequences of disastrous policies that have brought the country to its knees. Stefan addresses the values at the core of the SVP and accusations that the political ideology was based in National Socialism. Then, Stefan details how he has seen the overall moral foundations of Swedes manipulated and denigrated by deceitful detractors during his time in Nationalist movement. He gives a promising forecast for Sweden’s phase of strengthening and improvement that is taking shape, highlighting some of the aims of the APF. 

In the members’ hour, we address strategies for engaging in the meta-political battle to awaken the Swedish people and organize the ones who are already lit with discontent. We consider how we can reinvigorate a proud sense of achievement and encourage more of the great contributions that made European civilization uniquely exceptional. Stefan affirms that the complexity of the message must not be oversimplified and by striking at the heart and essence of the European folk, a profound realization of what’s at stake will inspire change. We look at the key elements of revitalizing a healthy sense of family values and self-reliance and taking a stand to build viable futures for our dear children. Stefan emphasizes concentrating on the emotional impact of the demographic suicide Europeans are being faced with in readying them for a true opposition to globalism and the ruthless targeting of Whites. Later, we discuss changes to the Swedish constitution making it legal for the military to be deployed against the people, and how we can work within the system that is already in place to eradicate corruption, change to a nationalistic point of view, and get more people cooperating to rebuild Sweden’s identity.

Title: Stephen E. Flowers - Restoring the Indo-European Religion: Zoroastrianism, Germanic Paganism...
Date: 2016-03-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=VomiUEsqvAg
Description: Stephen E. Flowers - Restoring the Indo-European Religion: Zoroastrianism, Germanic Paganism, & Rune Magic - Hour 1

Stephen Edred Flowers, also known by the pen-name Edred Thorsson, is an American Runologist and proponent of occultism, Germanic mysticism, Odinism, esoteric runosophy, Asatru, and Mazdaism. He is known for being instrumental in the early establishment of the Germanic Neopagan movement in North America and has been involved in Left-Hand Path organizations. Flowers has hundreds of published papers and over three dozen books, including “The Good Religion” and the forthcoming release, “Original Magic”. Flowers is currently director of the Woodharrow Institute of Germanic Studies and the owner and operator of Runa-Raven Press.

Stephen begins by discussing his vision for rejuvenating the Indo-European way through a revival of well-founded Germanic traditions and the restoration of traditional areas of study that are being eliminated from academia. He explains the foundations of the Mazdan tradition and its ultimate goal of attaining happiness in the here and now, and he speaks to the importance of preserving the heroic myths that our ancestors would evoke to organize and motivate societies. We talk about the centuries-long, coercive Christianization process that eroded away the ancient organic values of Indo-European folk-groups and flipped the true position of humanity on its head with the idea of original sin. Stephen highlights his understanding of the connection between the formation of the Germanic religion and the Zoroastrian way, and he emphasizes how the absence of culturally conditioned images allowed different cultural spheres to develop according to a veneration for their own symbols, myths and rituals.

In the members’ segment, Flowers talks about ancient horse domestication and the profoundness of the great myth of the American frontier. Then, Stephen explains the history of the Germanic writing system called the Runes and the relationship between the theory of magic and the mystical study of runes. We discuss rune magic, the use of artistic, mythical components in conveying messages, and the function of rune stones in immortalizing the dead and instilling motivation for group survival. We also touch on the application of runes in self-transformation, which Stephen says can be used to facilitate communications between one’s conscious and unconscious mind and in activating the spirit. Additionally, Stephen gives recommendations for inspiring a sense of spirituality and purpose through self-exploration and bonding with other like-minded individuals in real life. At the end, we consider the Persian Empire’s role in spreading the Aryan traditions of community and rights for all living things.

Title: Benton Bradberry - The Myth of German Villainy - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=LkMrCHaSi0M
Description: Benton L. Bradberry served in the U.S. Navy from 1955 to 1977 during the Cold War. He is a graduate of the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, California with a degree in Political Science and International Relations. Bradberry’s generation was inundated with anti-German propaganda and “Holocaust” lore and he spent years researching “the other side of the story,” which is compiled in his book, “The Myth of German Villainy.” 

Mr. Bradberry begins by describing some of the typical anti-German propaganda he encountered along the way in Europe during his Navy years and in recent travels – a vile and evil picture so different from the true character of the highly civilized and cultivated German people he discovered. Benton explains how WWI and WWII were thrust upon Germany, who was surpassing the Allied powers in technology, science and medicine, in an effort by Britain, France and Russia to destroy their mutual rival. We get into the Zionist funding that helped ensure the US presidency for Woodrow Wilson, which was the beginning of the anti-German propaganda campaign that led to America declaring war on Germany. Bradberry highlights the saga of the Communist Bolshevik Revolution that was instigated by Lenin and Trotsky, and he details just how deeply embedded the Jewish faction was in the Red Terror that left roughly 40 million Russian Christians dead. Then, we touch on the communist Spartacist uprising, the Versailles Treaty, and the British imposed starvation blockade that forced Germany to resort to drastic measures. 

In the members’ half, Ben breaks down how the highly cohesive minority of Jews managed to take over the Communist party, and the banking industry, and become overwhelmingly overrepresented in every institution and profession during the chaotic years when Germany’s economy was destroyed. We discuss Hitler’s election to chancellor and his promise to restore Germany for the Germans, and how he won over the hearts and minds of his beloved countrymen, women and children. Benton explains the declaration of holy war against Germany by the international Zionist movement, and we go over the 25 policies of the National Socialist movement. We consider the incredible challenges Hitler faced in rebuilding Germany and the extreme actions that were employed in order to purge the country of its corrosive elements. Then, we look at the events surrounding the Polish corridor land dispute and the start of WWII, the fake pretexts that pitted France and Britain against Germany, and the big picture of the grisly carnage of Germany after the war. At the end, we turn our thoughts to the current refugee situation in Europe, Merkel, Trump, and the war on Whites.

Title: Brandon Martinez - Neocon Globalism & Kalergi's Plan to Genocide Europeans - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=s1VkIiJ6k1g
Description: Brandon Martinez is an independent writer and journalist from Canada who specializes in foreign policy issues, international affairs and 20th and 21st century history. For years he has written on Zionism, Israel-Palestine, American and Canadian foreign policy, war, terrorism and deception in media and politics. He is the author of “Grand Deceptions, Hidden History and The ISIS Conspiracy.” 

In the first hour, Brandon outlines some of the new content that will be included in the forthcoming second edition of “Grand Deceptions.” The book covers the Zionist origins of the “War on Terror” beginning with 9/11 and the strategies that have been used in Syria, Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan throughout the entire Neocon conspiracy to create a clash of civilizations in the Middle East. Brandon details how the migrant crisis in Europe is part of a Zionist plot to weaken the West and break down the countries surrounding Israel in their quest for expansion. We look at the Jewish elite’s tactic of creating a divide in the consensus over the multicultural experiment, along with promoting activism aimed at exacerbating divisions through identity politics. Brandon goes into the history of Cultural Marxism and the Zionist Frankfurt School agenda to break down Western society. He also explains how Muslims are being used as willing pawns in the psychological war against Whites that is designed to produce a disillusionment of ethnic homogeneity so as to further the long-term Coudenhove-Kalergi goal of creating a “Eurasian-Negroid” mongrel globalist slave race. Then, we discuss how legitimate Nationalist movements concerned with the Islamic diaspora are being hijacked by Zionist Neocon agents like Pegida UK who are openly supporting Israel, creating a schizophrenic reaction to the issue of forced multiculturalism. 

In the members’ hour, we address the problems we face in bringing awareness to the general populace of the Zionist scheme against Whites while promoting self-determination for all peoples on Earth. Brandon says that we must take a moralistic approach to opposing the agenda to destroy Europe and avoid emanating the holier-than-thou attitudes of the evil elites we oppose. We get into the issue of Jewish supremacy and the fact that Islamization of the West is looked at as punishment for the Christian persecution of Jews 100s of years ago, and the holocaust can be invoked at any time to silence any “anti-Semitism” coming from “gentiles.” We also discuss the myth of the 6 million that has been part of an ages-old religious narrative of a Jewish messiah’s return to Earth. Further, we emphasize how the cultural disruption in Europe resulting from mass immigration serves as a smoke screen for more purging of Syrians and other Middle Easterners in Israel’s psychopathic push to expand territory and control more oil and water resources. Later, our focus turns to the tremendous task it is to power forth and continue the quest of exposing the root cause of our world’s decaying condition.

Title: Sofia Smallstorm - Transformers: How Federal Grant Money is Buying You Globalism - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=WtS0NbsO_cA
Description: Sofia Smallstorm is known for the documentaries “9/11 Mysteries” and “Unraveling Sandy Hook.” Sofia is also recognized for her research on the connections between geoengineering and synthetic biology. 

Sofia joins us for a discussion about the federal grant money that is paving the way to America’s future under Agenda 21. In the first half, she explains how the United States of America, the federal government and Washington, DC were incorporated in 1871, creating a federal corporation franchise system that encompasses all cities, towns and local agencies. Sofia defines what it means to for local governments to accept grant money from and do contractual business with the federal government and how this essentially adds to its trillions of dollars of debt. Sofia says this borrowed money is paying for New World Order changes that are aimed at ushering in a new version of humanity, and the migrant floods taking place all over the West are just part of the plan to exchange its current populations for a more easily controlled mishmash of genderless, raceless cogs. Then, we discuss the militarization grants being awarded to cities and towns that agree to participate in active shooter drills, and how it is possible for our commercialized government to make decisions that are not representative of the peoples’ interests. 

In the members’ half, Sofia gets into the huge debt that the UN is taking on to fund its own migrant invasion, and we look at how the load of this population replacement will be dumped on the people. We talk about projections of Africa’s population quadrupling, and the fact that migration to Europe is promoted there as a way to punish the evil colonialists, which contradicts the big lie that predominately White countries will be enriched through more diversity. Further, we consider how race mixing is being marketed and endorsed in the US, and how people are being programmed to accept a world reconfigured by gender bending chemicals. Sofia emphasizes the idea that our reproductive rights could someday be handled by the same government corporation that exploits humans for funds and resources through a little contract known as a birth certificate. As our conversation rounds off, we reflect on some of the problems we face as toxic overload is permanently altering the genetic components of humans, and how to balance the autonomic nervous system for optimal health.

Title: Brian Ruhe & Alfred Schaefer - Breaking Modern Day Taboos & Fear of Thinking Different - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kBc6lDpjBNo
Description: Alfred Schaefer is a German producer with several YouTube videos that are aimed at exposing the brainwashing, lies and control words that are used to subject entire populations to the Zionist agenda. His video, “Brainwashing: 9/11 & the Holohoax,” Schaefer outlines how the Zio-Jew criminal elite in control of much of Western civilization for the past 70 years have managed to perpetrate a massive deception through manipulation of the mainstream media and political leaders. 

Brian Ruhe was a monk in Thailand and has taught Buddhism since 1996 in the Vancouver, BC area. He hosts a YouTube channel talk show where he challenges Jewish supremacy and explores the true history of World War II. Ruhe is the president of the newly formed Thule Society, a peaceful, educational and personal growth training group centered on understanding of the spiritual forces that caused the powerful manifestation of National Socialist Germany and Adolf Hitler. 

Alfred joins us for the first time and Brian returns to discuss how Europe has devolved into its current state through the employment of social engineering designed to brainwash all of Western society into marching toward its own destruction. Alfred explains how the discourse has been programmed through a slow inoculation of politically correct control words that work like filters or gates to block out rational thinking and the natural instinct of self-preservation. We discuss how WWII, Holocaust and Nazi propaganda has been used to effectively instill a cult of guilt in the West, which grooms average citizens to fear any questioning of the official narrative that is obviously filled with holes and lies. We look at how the migrant invasion of Europe has been deliberately instigated through manufactured Middle Eastern conflicts in order to dilute any sense of functional cohesion in the West. Brian emphasizes how the push for multicultural societies has eradicated the truth as a defense for preserving the interests of Western civilization. 

In the member segment, we focus on the rising tide of anger and discontent that is stemming from the lack of leadership in our criminal governments, and how to channel this energy into freeing ourselves from the chains of enslavement. We look at the propaganda monster that was birthed in the years surrounding WWII to demonize the Germans, which has now been expanded to all White nations. Brian explains the connection between Buddhism and National Socialism and illustrates how Hitler’s knowledge and mastery of the higher realms was part of his ascension to power as one of the most developed and brilliant leaders of the 20th century. We consider the hallmarks of Germany’s halcyon days and signs that we are witnessing a resurgence of traditional values as more and more people grow weary of the cultural Marxist agenda of demoralization and degeneration. Alfred speaks to the importance of overcoming the intimidating emotions triggered by control words like “Nazi,” “anti-Semite” and “racist,” and he outlines some language tools for dealing with people who use psychopathic behaviors to suppress reasonable discussion. Later, we weigh up the leadership qualities required for the European race to survive and overcome the clutches of organized Zionism.

Title: Alex Gabler & Melissa M鳺Ჯs - American Born Returning To Europe - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-03-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Vi7eCoJo-m4
Description: Melissa Meszaros and Alex Gabler are two American born women who returned to their ancestral homelands in Europe. Melissa lives in Hungary where she teaches and translates English, works in a caf鬠and periodically makes videos for her YouTube channel. Alex has traveled around 12 different European countries over the past six years and is now living in Germany where she writes occasionally for the EuropeanGuardian.com. 

Melissa and Alex are with us to discuss their individual experiences living in Europe and what the social and political climates are like compared to the United States. Melissa talks about how the influx of migrants in Hungary over last summer triggered her awakening to the anti-White and pro-refugee politics that have become so prominent in the West. Alex relates how she discovered a double standard in mainstream media reporting concerning the serious rape epidemic in Germany that has been brought on by the refugee invasion. We look at the styles of formal European schooling and social etiquette, along with the typically conservative way of life that is prominent in smaller villages. Then, we discuss the missing conservative element in mainstream politics and what spurs on more extreme stances and we examine the range of feminist ideals that shows a clear contrast between what is accepted in the US and in Europe. The conversation ends with thoughts on the resurgence of traditional values being seen within the Millennial generation, and the growing awareness that Europeans must band together with the goal of preserving heritage and preventing the extinction of our people.

Title: Christopher Jon Bjerknes - Albert Einstein: The Myth, the Plagiarist & the Zionist - Hour 1
Date: 2016-03-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=T1TUqw96iVw
Description: Christopher Jon Bjerknes is a writer and researcher who has published numerous books and articles on the history of the theory of relativity, Einstein, Zionism and the Armenian Genocide. “Albert Einstein: The Incorrigible Plagiarist” and “Mileva Einstein-Marity: Einstein’s Partner in Crime” are among Bjerknes’ most controversial works. 

In the first half, Christopher describes the evidence pointing to Albert Einstein's plagiarism of Hendrik Lorentz and countless other physicists in his development of the theory of relativity. He talks about Einstein the Zionist and the “Einstein Terror” – a Semitic method of suppression that was used to literally terrorize and imprison anyone who dared question the dogma of Einstein. We get into Einstein’s soured reputation in Germany and the big hype surrounding his arrival in New York City, where he relocated in order to specifically promote Zionism. Christopher illustrates how Einstein manipulated credit for the E=mc² formula and failed to understand the basic concept of space time. We touch on the gravitational wave theory being hyped in the scientific press today and the costly reinforcement of flawed experimentation that is deliberately leading Western science away from technologies being advanced in Israel. Then, Christopher gets into the role that Mileva Einstein-Marity played in turning Einstein’s theoretical ideas into formal mathematical theories. We also put focus on the development of the pop culture icon of Einstein and the impact this cultish persuasion has had on the foundations of Western civilization. 

In the members’ half, Christopher details Einstein’s instrumental role in the Zionist agenda and the fact that he was treasonous to his own people and despised Europeans. We look at the Freemason Coudenhove-Kalergi’s founding ideology of the European Union and the banking moguls who funded an explicit plan to weaken the European people, lift up the so-called masterful and morally superior Jewish people, and fulfill the ancient messianic prophecy of world rule as declared in the Talmud and Kabballah. Christopher points to other pseudo-Christian kabbalists like Isaac Newton who were instrumental in promoting the Christian Zionist movement. He explains the implications of the concept of “as above, so below” in relation to the psychological, technical and religious warfare that has been unleashed by Jews to propagate political movements designed to quickly bring forth prophetic conditions. Further, Bjerknes emphasizes how the current rise of Islam in Europe is part of an ancient plan to annihilate Christians via the Muslim hand. We consider how Whites have been programmed with the belief of their original sin, and how Islamic teachings justify and encourage the mass raping and slaughter of “white devils.” Later, we look at the infiltration of Zionist interests within the US White House, and the modern liberal tactic of subverting the Western world from within. At the end, Christopher talks about the Anno Lucis dating system and highlights what the New Testament says about the 2500-year-old conspiracy to genocide all gentiles.

Title: Bob Whitaker & Tom Bowie - The US Presidential Candidate Fighting White Genocide - Hour 1
Date: 2016-02-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=eiztH9MdUD4
Description: Bob Whitaker is running for president on the American Freedom Party (AFP) ticket. He has been a college professor, international aviation negotiator, Capitol Hill staffer, Reagan Administration appointee, and writer for the Voice of America. Whitaker has written numerous articles and three books, and is perhaps best known for being the creator of The Mantra, a strategy to fight White Genocide. Tom Bowie is the AFP Vice Presidential running mate. He has been a member of the US Marine Corps and the Maryland Defense Force. Bowie formed a STAR (State Tactical and Response) Team, chartered an Explorer troop under the Boy Scouts of America, and has worked with the State of Maryland Department of Health as a Health and Safety Specialist and a Special Police Officer.

The AFP candidates join us for an overview of the party’s running platform, which is centered on stopping the immigration invasion, fighting White genocide, and conquering cultural Marxism. Bob talks about the development of The Mantra, a tool of repetition aimed at leveling the field of free speech in America and taking on the thought police who work diligently to squash conversations about the anti-White scam chipping away at the country’s foundations. We discuss how the party is addressing the so-called “race problem” in America by hammering away at the mantras of “Diversity = White Genocide” and “Anti-Racist is a Code Word for Anti-White,” and we get into the controversial banning of billboards across the country. Tom talks about the true definition of white genocide and the skillful word spinning tactics the political elite use to promote “diversity” while detracting from the agenda of doing away with the White race.

In the members’ half, we look at the central issue of the US government turning against the best interests of its own people, and how Donald Trump is riding the wave of discontented Americans fed up with anti-White politics. Bob and Tom explain how a 3rd party can use the state election process to its advantage to grab ballot ticks from the huge chunk of independent voters that are disgusted with the system and ready to hitch on to a revolution. We weigh up the crumbling components of the Democrat vs Republican system and tired cuckservative campaigning schemes. At the end, the AFP campaign manager Laura Fitz-Gerald comes on and informs folks how to get involved in the upcoming primary elections.

Title: Daniel Carlsen - Party of the Danes: For the Future of Denmark - Hour 1
Date: 2016-02-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2lZ8ebEGswA
Description: Daniel Carlsen is the leader of the Party of the Danes, or Danskernes Parti. Born in 1990, he graduated from high school in 2009. In the period between August 2009 and April 2010, Daniel served his military time as a Royal Life Guard, protecting the Danish castles and the royal family. In 2012 Daniel got an Academy Profession Degree in Marketing Management. 

In the first segment, Daniel gives an overview of the time spent during his youth in the public school system in Denmark’s second largest city, Aarhus, where he began to understand the reality of his country’s rapidly changing demographics and the immigration issue. This led him to get engaged in political activism at an early age, and consequently in 2011 Carlsen and a group of other likeminded Danes built Danskernes Parti. Daniel speaks about some of the different political ideologies that define Denmark, including one he was a former member of, the Danish People’s Party. He describes the general social climate within some of the metropolitan areas of his small country, which host immigrant ghettos functioning as parallel societies with the equivalent of Sharia law governance. Daniel highlights Denmark’s population statistics, the symbolic laws that are in place to address the needs of asylum seekers, and the EU regulations that are designed to give “global diversity” a leg up within this tiny percentage of the world’s population. Further, we get into the negative consequences of the Schengen Zone and the real possibility of Denmark becoming one of Europe’s first Sharia zones via the open door policy that has essentially rolled out a red carpet for the world’s “refugees.” 

In the members’ segment, we discuss how a renewed sense of nationalism is the first step to addressing concerns about the future of the Danish people. Daniel talks about Scandinavia’s unique media climate and how political events that Party of the Danes has participated in are being portrayed in the mainstream news. We consider the historical period in Germany that was defined by National Socialism, and we look optimistically to an updated nationalist movement’s ability to address Europe’s current territorial issues while invigorating a sense of national pride, dedication, veneration for culture, and appreciation for heritage. Then, we focus on the fundamental core of the Germanic peoples that is rooted in a deep regard for familial values and tradition – a structure that is being quickly eroded with large movements of foreign populations. Can we stop globalization? Will the Northern Europe’s native populations be pushed even further past the periphery? In conclusion, Daniel covers the goals of Danskernes Parti and their strategic plan to be represented in Parliament in order to address issues that will give the people of Denmark hope and trust in the survival of her people.

Title: Jon Rappoport, Dr. Sherri Tenpenny & Andreas Bachmair - Zika Virus “Outbreak”...
Date: 2016-02-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=L8nLPBXZfUA
Description: Jon Rappoport, Dr. Sherri Tenpenny & Andreas Bachmair - Zika Virus “Outbreak” & The Vaccine Industry - Hour 1

Jon Rappoport has worked as a free-lance investigative reporter for over 30 years. He is the author of several books, including “AIDS, Inc.: Scandal of the Century.” He is behind the website NoMoreFakeNews.com. Dr. Sherri J. Tenpenny, founder of Tenpenny Integrative Medical Center in Middleburg, Ohio, has been board certified in Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine since 1995. She has written two best-selling books, “FOWL! Bird Flu: It’s Not What You Think” and “Saying No To Vaccines: A Resource Guide for All Ages.” Andreas Bachmair is a German homeopath physician with a practice in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. The focus of his work for over a decade has been the treatment of vaccine-related injuries. This led him to create the website VaccineInjury.info. He is also the author of the newly released book, “Sarah Doesn’t Want to be Vaccinated.” 

Our three returning guests join us for a discussion on the dangerous affair of vaccines and the misleading propaganda being peddled by infectious disease agencies. We begin with an in-depth look into the latest “outbreak” hysteria centered on Zika, where the main controversy of the mosquito born virus cropping up in Brazil is being linked to microcephaly in newborn babies by the World Health Organization. Jon gives the generalities of the fraudulent science backing the WHO’s claims and he explains how this scare is being used as a psyop to cover up another serious problem. Sherri talks about the recent MMR vaccine campaign that led to the re-vaccination of around 39,000 women of child bearing age in Brazil, and she lays out how the Zika virus being labeled as an international emergency could allow an epic opportunity for the big-pharma-funded FDA to roll out a mass utilization of untested vaccinations. In addition, we get into the incestuous affairs of the “virus hunter” branch of the CDC, along with their ties to the mainstream press and the giant pesticide corporations that are making big bucks in Brazil. 

In the members’ segment, we address some of the foundations of the vast vaccine debate. Andreas talks about the online survey he’s been collecting for over five years in order to study different illnesses in unvaccinated vs. vaccinated children. We consider the 1.3 trillion dollar worldwide pharmaceutical industry’s cornerstone business of vaccine production and the scam statistics that keep these toxic concoctions flowing through the medical marketplace. Then, we discuss the immune system’s natural defense mechanisms, the false premise that humans should never get sick, and the benefits of naturally occurring of childhood diseases. We put focus on the deadly HPV vaccine, Gardasil, and the horrible implications that this reproductive system destroying inoculation is another device to stop the growth of certain populations. Further, we deliberate the huge moneymaking scam of the National Cancer Institute’s futile attempts to find a link between viruses and cancer. The conversation rounds off with a look at the deeper issue of why vaccines are falsely promoted as protection for the young, the old, and the chronically ill.

Title: Canadian Roundtable - The Trial of Arthur Topham & The Jewish Lobby in Canada
Date: 2016-02-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=IPH33ExRfcA
Description: Canadian born Arthur Topham has a background in Political Science and Education. Since 1999 he has been the Writer, Journalist, Publisher & Editor of RadicalPress.com. Paul Fromm heads the Canada First Immigration Reform Committee and the Canadian Association for Free Expression, Canada's leading defender of free speech. Gilad Atzmon is a British jazz artist and author who was born in Israel. He is a member of the Blockheads, founded the Orient House Ensemble, and also writes on political matters, social issues, Jewish identity and culture. Brian Ruhe was a monk in Thailand and has taught Buddhism since 1996 in the Vancouver, BC area. He hosts a YouTube channel talk show where he challenges Jewish supremacy and talks about the revisionist history of World War II. Jason Erb has been writing for his blog, Exposing Faux Capitalism, since the start of the global financial collapse of 2008 and has been hosting his own weekly radio show since 2012. 

We bring together this roundtable to address the demographic and cultural suicide that is plaguing the West, along with the repressive laws that are compounding Canada’s identity crisis. Arthur gives details about his trial before the Supreme Court of British Columbia in late 2015, where he faced charges under the Canadian Criminal Code, sec. 319(2) "Hate Propaganda" legislation for "willfully promoting hatred against an identifiable group, people of the Jewish religion or ethnic origin." Arthur has been under attack by B’nai Brith Canada since 2007 for his non-violent expression of political views, along with Brian Ruhe, who was fired from five teaching positions at Capilano University for bringing his observations to light via YouTube. Paul, who covered the Topham trial, was also dismissed from an English instructor position by the Peel Board of Education in 1997, after years of pressure from Jewish lobby groups who hated his support for victims of censorship and his opposition to the displacement of the founding stock of Canada. He says the censorship spirit has seized much of the politically correct establishment of Canada. 

Gilad appeared as an expert witness in the case, where he presented evidence explaining the clear dichotomies between criticizing Jews the people, the Jewish religion, and the Jewish-ness ideology. He is well versed in exposing the barbaric and evil political ideology known as Zionism and in addressing the tribal mechanisms that are unique to Israel’s Jewish elite. We discuss the outright hypocrisy and double standards regarding freedom of expression within the Canadian judicial system that the Topham case has revealed, and we also look at the ongoing demographic destruction that is being deliberately pushed by immigration laws designed “diversify” Canada. We consider the fascinating level of interests that Jewish lobby groups have in supporting immigration around the world and what advantage the Jews gain by diluting every other ethnic race. Jason comes in at the end to give his take on Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms and other political engineering tactics that are whittling away at constitutional rights and the entire European cultural spirit that built Canada and the great West.

Title: Adam - Eurotunnel Insider Speaks Out on Waves of Migrants
Date: 2016-02-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=TG-cveGhgLI
Description: Adam has worked for many years as a firefighter at the Eurotunnel fire station and with Kent Fire and Rescue service. He joins us to give an insider account of the myriad of incidents with illegal immigrants he has dealt with and witnessed at the Eurotunnel site, where the Fire and Rescue service has been pulled into the role of searching the trains and tunnels for foreign trespassers. Beginning in the summer of2015, a massive explosion of immigrants crossing from Calais to Dover has inundated French Police and Eurotunnel security, with an estimated 57,000 illegals removed from the French terminal in 2015 alone. We talk about the French ferry worker strike that brought mainstream attention to the migrant crisis, when the press broke with the story of the massive organized invasion of 1500 migrants storming the channel tunnel via the Calais terminal. Adam gives details of the different strategies employed by the desperate travelers who stow away on freight lorries or trains, or even walk, as a means to get through to the UK’s generous asylum seeker benefits. He speaks about the dangerous diseases that are making their way through and costing the UK health service billions of pounds per year, along with the UK financed, £12,000,000 fence being constructed around the Calais terminal perimeter that has actually made it easier for invaders to cross. Adam says that anywhere from 100-150 migrants armed with knives and iron bars are funneling through to the UK each day, and the dire consequences can be seen in the skyrocketing crime rates and the numbers of unaccompanied “children” that require rehoming, among other frightening figures related to the economy. Later, we look at the major obstacle of political correctness that is keeping European governments from properly addressing this mass invasion, and we discuss whether or not the outdated Schengen Zone agreement will be modified in an attempt to quell the fresh surge of migrants forecast to hit Europe come spring.

Title: Jordan Maxwell - Liberation into Subversion: The World Revolution Movement - Hour 1
Date: 2016-02-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=w6id3FsSNfk
Description: Jordan Maxwell continues as a researcher and an independent scholar in the field of occult / religious philosophy. His interest in these subjects began as far back as 1959. He has conducted dozens of intensive seminars, hosted his own radio talk shows, guested on more than 600 radio shows, and has written, produced and appeared in numerous television shows and documentaries, including the five-part Ancient Mystery Series. 

Jordan returns to Red Ice for another look into what has created the catastrophic times we’re living in and where we are headed. He points to an old operation known as the World Revolution Movement that began in the early 1700s with secret fraternal orders in Europe as the leading edge behind our world class scene of chaos. We look at the corrupt institutions guiding this crusade – from the government to the banking industry, the military industrial complex and the education system – all of which Jordan says are being controlled by evil forces. Jordan talks about how human progress is being destroyed through a highly orchestrated and heavily financed Marxist experiment in cultural subversion, with America “liberation” and Hollywood at the forefront of the overall transvaluation of societal values. We discuss the liberal progressive agenda that came out of the opposition to fascism and National Socialism, which, with the aid of marketing, social engineering and manipulation, has now shifted mankind towards a profound state of ignorance and degeneracy. Further, we get into who produced the “American Dream” ideal and all its materialistic promises of liberty, justice and freedom. 

In the members’ segment, we look at recent developments in the US political system, with the openly socialist Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders running as democrats. Jordan expands upon the fact that all communist governments are referred to politically as the “people’s democratic republics,” and that the American system has been infiltrated with communist ideology since the days of Marx and Lenin. We also discuss how the banking families of America and England financed the Bolshevik communist party. Then, we consider how thousands of years of rule by tyrants and war lords vying for worldwide control has been made possible through the promotion of terrorism, violence, drugs, alcoholism, brainlessness, and all things corrupt. Jordan illustrates why he believes there is a wicked hand, not from this world guiding humanity into the abyss. Later, we analyze the attack on the European nations, surging tide of social unrest and violence that has been brought on by the foreign Islamic invasion and what looks to be a coordinated effort by EU leaders to push a major clash of civilizations.

Title: Richard Thomas - Power Through Discipline: The Plague of Weak Men - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-02-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kkcOJliFj3E
Description: Richard Thomas was formerly behind Truth Militia and the Truth Militia Radio Network. He now runs a new website, Power Through Discipline, and hosts a weekly radio show: PTD Radio. Rich's new project focuses on rebuilding our men, our families, and the communities we live in by developing power through hardcore discipline. 

Rich is with us to discuss his mission at PTD, where he’s working through a holistic approach to implement solutions to the main problem we face today in America and the rest of the Western World: a lack of REAL men. By zeroing in on health, fitness, nutrition, family values and spirituality, Rich promotes practical measures to tackle the weak, soft, beaten down, and feminized mindset that has become the hallmark of men in the West. Rich talks about the need for self-sacrifice, dedication and hard work in transcending the lazy, victimhood mentality plaguing men and women in this modern age of convenience and instant gratification. Rich says that it’s time to own up to and fix the catastrophic mistakes that have led us to our current mess – out of control feminism, wicked cultural and social Marxism, and obnoxious political correctness. We look at the leadership qualities of powerful men like Donald Trump, along with the importance of strong, confident, well-spoken father figures setting examples for our sons and daughters. Rich emphasizes the crucial aspect of getting involved on a local level to ensure the rich fabric of American society is not diluted with 3rd world standards. We round off the conversation with practical solutions for overcoming personal limitations and achieving optimal physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing.

Title: Augustus Sol Invictus - Libertarian Realism: Folk, Culture & Borders - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-02-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=jWHKfaLwFk4
Description: Augustus Invictus is an attorney and community leader in Orlando, Florida who is a candidate in the 2016 US Senate election. Best known as a radical philosopher and infamous social critic, he is Managing Partner of Imperium, P.A., the law firm he founded in 2013. As an attorney, Augustus has worked to defend those who have become collateral damage of America’s two longest-running wars: the War on Drugs and the War on Terror. 

Augustus begins with an explanation of the name he has chosen to identify with, along with the mystical path that led him to study law and eventually pursue politics. He talks about his affiliation with the Libertarian Party (LP) and the problems he sees with its watered down, mainstream message. Augustus describes the main issues he aspires to tackle as Senator: the drug war, foreign policy, and the financial crisis. We get into the customary LP stances on open borders, immigration and equality, and we look at how these key concerns have been muddled with leftist contention. Augustus shares his view on the problems that will ensue for Libertarian ideals if non-Westerners continue to flood into America, and he also speaks to the Marxist degeneracy that has infected pop culture and the educational system. Then, we discuss the absence of natural law and hierarchy in the current US government system, along with the tyrannical forces pushing oppressive mandatory regulations, censorship and hate speech laws. At the end, Augustus sums up the actions he is taking to tackle the looney left’s war on White men and inspire a resurrection of the American front.

Title: Jim Rizoli - What Really Happened at Auschwitz? - Hour 1
Date: 2016-02-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=c4qzF5oAVEU
Description: Jim Rizoli is a cofounder, producer and interviewer of the League of Extraordinary Revisionists, a series of discussions with key figures in the revisionist movement, as well as unsung heroes and German survivors of the Allied atrocities. Prior to this project, Jim and his brother, Joe, formed Concerned Citizens and Friends of Illegal Immigration Law Enforcement (CCFIILE), an organization dedicated to alerting the public and addressing the overwhelming problems associated with illegal immigration.

In this discussion, Jim recounts how his activism that was geared towards immigration issues in his town of Framingham, Massachusetts, a notorious gateway for illegals, led him to the case of Ernst Zündel in Canada, a German publisher prosecuted for having reprinted the pamphlet, “Did 6 Million Really Die?” Jim talks about his run-ins with the ADL and SPLC once he and CCFIILE were picked up on the anti-Semitic radar for producing cable TV shows dealing with the holocaust, earning him a reputation for being a hate group ringleader. Jim explains the big issues of the official holocaust story that stood out for him and what prompted him to investigate the peculiar details of supposed concentration camp gas chambers at the Auschwitz complex. We discuss the Russian renovations of the camps after WWII that were the finishing touches on the concocted story of 4 million prisoner lives taken at the hands of evil Germans. We also get into the some of the outrageous survivor claims and testimonies that have perpetuated the wartime horror stories that gave the camps such sinister reputations. Further, Jim details the logistics of crematoriums that were operating to manage the body counts from colossal typhus outbreaks, starvation, and Allied Forces bombing campaigns, among other war atrocities.

In the members’ segment, we go deeper into the particulars of mass human extermination and body disposal, which in reality was oddly inefficient considering the capabilities of sophisticated German engineering. Jim talks about Treblinka, a fabricated concentration camp that is tied in with some of the most shocking and mind boggling accounts of the holocaust chronicle. We consider the false figures and perpetual lies that have made it possible for Jewish holocaust survivors to reap tremendous financial rewards, incentives that are protected by increasing hate speech laws and the threat of being blacklisted for holocaust denial. Jim gets into the story of the alleged “architect of the Nazi holocaust,” Adolf Eichmann, and other defendants in the Nuremberg trials that were likely mentally tortured and threatened in exchange for their amenable testimonies. Later, Jim describes the revolutionary work of the League of Extraordinary Revisionists, and then we shift gears to the current immigration catastrophe that is changing the face of Europe and the US.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0sRlSIAAzUE
Description: John Morgan is Editor-in-Chief and co-founder of Arktos Media. He is also one of the editors of the new Right On website. Greg Johnson is Editor-in-Chief of Counter Currents. He is the author of "Confessions of a Reluctant Hater," "New Right vs. Old Right," and the newly published “Truth, Justice, & a Nice White Country.” Daniel Friberg is a founding member of the Swedish metapolitical think-tank Motpol. He is also the co-founder and CEO of Arktos Media and author of "The Real Right Returns.” Richard Spencer is President of National Policy Institute (NPI) and Editor of Washington Summit Publishers and Radix Journal. Ramzpaul is known for his iconoclastic YouTube channel that mocks cultural Marxism and pokes fun at the establishment and contemporary politics through satire and humor.

For this roundtable, we bring together some notable and recognizable figures in the Alt Right scene. We begin by looking back on 2015, a year when we witnessed unprecedented chaos in Europe and a remarkable Western culture awakening. We discuss how an array of events – from the refugee crisis in Europe, to the Ferguson and #blacklivesmatter riots in US, and the Paris attacks – all spurred on a mass realization that the tired left/liberal and mainstream conservative aphorisms and tactics have lost traction. Richard speaks to the inspiring numbers of new people that are being “red-pilled” every day, which has resulted in a high demand for a completely new alternative to the bankrupt mainstream. We look at ways in which we can drive the Alt Right movement in a positive direction and offer a tangible vision for those who are craving something new. Greg describes how ideas coming out of the Alt Right, like the Cuckservative meme, are now driving mainstream debates, and Daniel emphasizes the importance of focusing on metapolitics as a means to shape a cultural cleanup. Then, we get into the differing concepts of White Nationalism and Ethno Nationalism, and whether or not Europe has something to learn from America in terms of racial identity, or if breaking up into separate, sovereign nations is the answer to the ages-old Western ethnic rivalry.

In the second hour, Ramzpaul explains how he employs a comedic slant to get around censorship while conveying his message in a nonthreatening way. We discuss the tremendous opportunities that exist in the Alt Right for talented individuals to produce low-cost media content with a core message, and brainstorm ways to encourage meetups, community building, and the recruitment of other like-minded folks to support and join the cause. We talk about some of the obstacles that we face with censorship policies on social networking platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as the excellent propaganda that is generated from controversies that end up being covered by the MSM. We get into the power of trolling, the great advantage of the decentralized nature of the Alt Right, and the fact that this instinctually driven movement is the sexiest alternative to any snively SJW popularity contest. In closing, John emphasizes the exciting prospect that the Alt Right is well on its way to becoming the new counter culture, as it is by far the only true opposition with true rebel status.

Title: Andy Nowicki - Conspiracy & The Alt-Right - Hour 1
Date: 2016-02-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=RfXkiZuxKL0
Description: Andy Nowicki lives and works in Savannah, Georgia as the assistant editor of the online magazine, Alternative Right. Nowicki is also the author of several books, including “The Columbine Pilgrim,” “Heart Killer,” “Confessions of a Would-Be Wanker,” “Considering Suicide” and “Notes Before Death.” 

Andy is with us to talk about his latest book, “Conspiracy, Compliance, Control and Defiance,” which he describes as a meta-conspiritual analysis of the nature of power and the contemporary ruling class. We discuss the connotative meanings of the term “conspiracy theory” and the idea that people who ascend to the top are typically the most prone to ruthlessness and backstabbing. We consider how events like 9/11 and Sandy Hook have been meticulously exploited to push certain agendas that further a totalitarian regime. Andy gives his perspective on what it’s like to be a “closet truther” questioning the reality of the mainstream portrayal of tragic events, and eventually realizing the sheer magnitude of evil that is at play. Then, Andy defines the characteristics of what he calls “our Reptilian rulers,” who have the capacity to commit crimes against the innocent with a terrifying degree of cold-blooded malevolence while still being revered as upstanding leaders. We get into the sophisticated game of manipulation that our top politicians have mastered and polished to perfection, albeit at times stupendously failing. 

In the members’ segment, Andy continues on the nature of the reptile, how we can understand what we’re dealing with, and what can be done. He draws some distinctions between the common sociopath and the reptilian, both of whom display a definitive lack of love, conscience and remorse, but the latter demonstrating an ambitious lust for power and an active, sadistic desire to prey upon and hurt others. We discuss the R-complex part of the triune brain and the theory that sociopathic leaders associate more with this primal, calculating and sometimes unpredictable operating center. Then, we discuss how marketing and propaganda is designed to appeal to the reptilian brain, and we consider how difficult it is for the average person to first find the time and then the drive to wade through the mountains of conspiracies that are engineered to create confusion. Later, we focus on the great divide that exists within the Alt Right concerning conspiracy theories, and we emphasize the importance of setting aside particulars to clear the way for a mission of truth and perseverance that will break the cycle of the West’s current cultural decline.

Title: Insight - White Girls Black Dolls: Destroying White Bias
Date: 2016-01-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=4UoZisxgxgE
Description: Lana provides an alternative view to the Kenneth Clark's 1940s doll study and provides the historical background that connects the American Civil Rights Movement, Communism and the Frankfurt School. After Hitler, Jewish intellectuals pushed critical theory as a means to destroy Western Civilization and "potential fascists." We'll fast forward to today and see these ideas in action, ultimately seeking the total obliteration of White people. White girls loving White dolls is racism but Black girls loving Black dolls is self love?

Title: David Cole - The Truth Behind the Gates of Auschwitz
Date: 2016-01-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=QxAvpvz_4wQ
Description: David Cole, the “Jewish Holocaust Revisionist,” made a documentary called, “The Truth Behind the Gates of Auschwitz,” when he was a young man in his early 20s. He spent eighteen years as David Stein, the “Republican Party Animal,” working with GOP higher-ups and blogging for major conservative sites. The full story of his life as an “evil” holocaust revisionist and the fascinating account of his involvement in politics, along with the tale of his “outing” are all detailed in his book, “Republican Party Animal.” 

David describes his early years in southern California, where he started looking at holocaust revisionism in 1989. At one time he came to the defense of Ernst Zündel, the infamous political prisoner who spent more than seven years locked up in Germany on charges of holocaust denial. We learn about the time frame between the making of David’s film in 1992, to when he went into hiding once the JDL placed a bounty on his head, up to the outing by his ex-girlfriend in 2013, and the frenzied fallout that ensued. David talks about what it’s like returning to the realm of holocaust revisionism, and we discuss many of the curious details on display at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum. We get into everything from the construction of the gas chambers, to the 1000s of cans of Zyklon B, the blue walls in delousing facilities, human hair slippers and more. David also illustrates some of the most chilling facts that have been established about the labor camps that were in operation before, during and after the bloody World Wars, including the horrific typhus epidemic and the murder of many thousands of Europeans, some of whom were Jews. Then, David covers the crucial evidence that is in fact missing from arguments that millions of innocents were gassed and exterminated at the hands of Nazis. In closing, we zoom out to the present-day situation in multicultural Germany, where an imported rape culture has emerged and the holocaust saga continues to be propagated to create more suffering for the Germans in the name of revenge.

Title: Brian Anse Patrick - Zombies & PropaGUNda - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=bAjRt0gdQLc
Description: Dr. Brian Anse Patrick is a professor of communication at the University of Toledo. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in research methods, group communication, propaganda and persuasion. He is also a nationally recognized expert on American gun culture as well as the author of many scholarly papers and books, including “The Ten Commandments of Propaganda,” “Zombology: Zombies and the Decline of the West (and Guns)” and his forthcoming release, “PropaGUNda: The Informational War over Guns.”

In the first hour, Brian talks about the rise of the zombie phenomenon, which he calls the premier archetype of modern times. We compare the original, minion-like, brain-eating zombie under the control of evil forces with the modern day, mass society version of autonomy – braindead cogs plugged into a constant stream of entertainment and self-affirming social media. Brian relates this trend to the UFO craze - a visionary rumor that bloomed out of the high-anxiety climate of the nuclear age and the Cold War. He says the zombie trend is a signal of cultural decline and a general breakdown of civil society, and it has that ultimate death head symbol appeal. We look at Hollywood depictions of the Zombie archetype and the common theme of a few armed individuals responding to uncontrolled outbreaks of the living dead. Brian illustrates how the zombie outlet serves a function as a projection of what is forbidden to be feared and hated about society. Further, we connect the government’s subsidization of low-level behaviors to a general decline in intelligence and the looming collapse of Western culture.

In the members’ hour, we get into the spike in gun sales in Europe that resulted from the Cologne sex attacks, and we consider what’s causing the surge of women entering gun culture in America. Brian describes the steps to selecting an appropriate weapon and getting the proper training, he defines the laws of self-defense, and highlights potential repercussions for exercising 2nd Amendment rights. We also talk about the deeply traditional and ceremonial significance of hunting and Brian gives recommendations for efficient rifles. Later, Brian discusses common idiosyncrasies of many university professors – our chief administrators of cultural Marxist ideologies – who are leading the way towards the internal colonization of citizens. As we round things off, Brian touches on Donald Trump’s very Aristotle-like qualities, his decidedly old and wrinkled competition, and the psychopathic penchants of past presidents.

Title: Marcus Follin, Justin Garcia & Paul Waggener - Man Up to the Invasion - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=mQ3x2B-abEU
Description: Marcus Follin produces the popular YouTube channel, The Golden One, which focuses on masculinity, strength training and metapolitics. He studies Economics and is a contributor at RightOn.net, an online resource for the rising True Right of Europe. 

Justin Garcia, aka “Master Chim,” is behind The Pressure Project podcast and The Jungle Gym martial arts academy. His mission and work is centered on empowering men to reclaim what masculinity once was and fighting cultural Marxism. 

Paul Waggener is a founding member of Wolves of Vinland, a tribal organization with chapters across America that exists to pressure the strengthening of character amongst its folk. Operation Werewolf is the creation of Paul and the banner under which the Wolves operate around the world. 

In this roundtable, Marcus, Justin, Paul and Henrik address some key issues currently facing the men of Western civilization. We begin with a look into the recent Cologne sex attacks and the numerous other assaults that have been perpetrated by foreign “rapefugees” across Europe. Marcus gives his perspective on the dangerous mix brewing within Sweden, as culturally incompatible invaders bring with them a set of rules that starkly opposes the moral codes and sense of honor of high trust societies. The overarching strategy for managing this kind of violent threat to the social order is through man’s commitment to physical fitness and intimate relationships with warrior ethos, tribalism and violence. We consider the ideas of self-sacrifice and staying within the bounds of the system as we grapple with the task of returning our societal standards to the highest good. Paul says that we must act with pure hearts, strong limbs and actions matching words. Then, we get into what it takes to create strong networks and tribes, defend our borders, women and children, and combat the dividing forces of 3rd wave feminism and cultural Marxism. 

In the second hour, we focus on the opportunities that the immigrant invasion has presented for the West in reexamining the importance of masculinity and stepping up to the generation’s challenge of restoring natural law and order. We discuss the benefits of leading a physically fit life and strategies for maintaining motivation. Justin defines the tribalist mindset in relation to nationalism, and he talks about honing a sense of self-worth that is impervious to all of the tired stereotypes and name calling associated with going against the liberal grain. Paul gets into the mission of Operation Werewolf and he illustrates the significance of a unified appearance amongst tribal folk. Then, we make some predictions for summertime, when another massive wave of migrants is forecast to descend upon Europe, and we look at strategies for upcoming pivotal phase of US politics. At the end, the group zeroes in on the value of tribe and steps for producing solidarity and success as we work to unify and strengthen our folk.

Title: Kristoffer Hell - Democracy to Death: Sweden’s Path to Disintegration & Palme Assassination - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=sddwp97_EX0
Description: Kristoffer Hell is a geopolitical analyst and writer who operates Blueshift.nu, and a related activist site, Radda Sverige (Save Sweden). A hallmark of Kristoffer's work has been the creation of online petitions on important issues, which have had an impact on Swedish politics and mobilized over 10,000 Swedes. He is the author of “Democracy to Death – Sweden’s Path into the Global Dictatorship” and “The Dark Heart of the West – 9/11, Geopolitical Terrorism & Globalization.” 

Kristoffer begins by talking about his efforts to bring awareness to some of the most pressing problems facing Sweden, such as the potential eradication of cash and the thousands of laws being voted in by Parliament each year that are encroaching on the freedoms of Swedes. He describes the European Union’s role in creating a global dictatorship, with state sponsored geopolitical terrorism financed by billionaires like George Soros. We discuss the Wallenberg banksters and the Bonnier media moguls, who together are responsible for controlling the mainstream narrative that is guilt shaming citizens into going along with the ridiculous policies thrust forth by the political elite. Kristoffer says that Sweden is in a state of freefall and system collapse, where a desperate situation is being inflamed, perhaps intentionally, by the open door immigration policy. We look at how the globalist plan of the Count of Coudenhove-Kalergi is coming to fruition in Sweden, now one of the most “diverse” and dangerous countries in Europe. 

In the members’ segment, Kristoffer gets into the history of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme and the details of his assassination in 1986. We discuss the many faces of Palme, who at one time appeared to be working against the globalist agenda. We consider the mysterious components of the submarine intrusions that linked him to the Soviet Union and an international plan to bring down Sweden. Kristoffer illustrates the many complicated facets of Palme’s background, where implications of counter intelligence spying and blackmail leave many questions surrounding a much bigger and devious deep state game of destruction. Then, we look at the long term effects of Palme’s political heritage and the role that Israel and Zionist money interests have played in the globalization game. Later, we return to the issue of Sweden becoming a cashless society and the changes to paper money that can be seen as symbolic gestures alluding to the war on the citizens and the rising technocratic system. In closing, we discuss the Swedish Democrats and its pro-Zionist leadership that has expelled true nationalists from the party.

Title: Libertarian Realist - Race Realism & Western Origins of Liberty - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PXgS2_UJegk
Description: Brad Trun is the writer and video producer known as Libertarian Realist. His YouTube channel features commentaries, satirical bits, and travelogues exposing politically incorrect realities. In 2014, he recorded travelogues in 12 US states and 21 countries, documenting demographic decline on the streets of cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, Dublin, Malmö, and Copenhagen. Libertarian Realist currently lives in Montana, where he is working on a book that will flesh out an ideology for a new ascendancy. 

Our conversation with Brad centers on the problems with open borders and the extreme leftwing ideology that ignores the cultural and biological realities that ought to sustain the foundations of any society. Brad talks about his philosophical journey of discerning the concepts that spawned libertarian ideals, including the non-aggression principle of ethics, and the system of objectivism developed by Ayn Rand. He explains Libertarian Realist ideology, which encompasses the four pillars of highly successful societies – genetics, borders, freedom and aesthetics. We discuss the Western origins of liberty and the founding traditions of America that were based in race realism and the creation of a nation comprised of people with adequate cultural understanding to live compatibly within a free society. Brad highlights where the persistent ideology of egalitarianism has perpetuated a failing system, with programs designed to close the achievement gap, such as welfare, affirmative action, and No Child Left Behind. Then, we look at how the increasingly blatant anti-White establishment and media is pushing more people away from the imposed ideals and religion of egalitarianism, and we take stock of what Trump is doing to delegitimize the nonsense of the political correctness in politics. Further, we get into the issues of anchor babies, minority votes, and the absence of immigration policies that protect the interests of citizens and enrich the population. 

In the members’ segment, we discuss the recent mass shootings in Paris and San Bernardino that have been attributed to Muslim terrorists, and we try to make some sense of the flagrant double standards that tell us Islamophobia is wrong and multiculturalism enhances society. Brad links this discounting of natural instincts to the oppressive system of political correctness and the weaponization of history. We consider how denying genetic differences and opening borders to hostile immigrants with the propensity for radicalization will ultimately lead to the destruction of Western freedoms. We look at the unsustainability of perpetual economic and population growth, and the qualitative aspects of a demographic decline. Libertarian Realist stresses the importance of harnessing realistic goals that will bring us towards the ascension of society. The discussion rounds off with an analysis of the misguided US foreign policies that have dumped billions of dollars into the egalitarian delusion that we can remake the rest of the world into our ideal image of democracy for all.

Title: Mariya Lesiv - The Return of Ancestral Gods: Modern Ukrainian Paganism - Radio 3 Fourteen
Date: 2016-01-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=21zDpig1UmI
Description: Dr. Mariya Lesiv is an Assistant Professor of Folklore at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada. Her research interests include diaspora studies, folklore and national/ethnic identity building, material culture, belief, religious folk life, and new religious movements. Mariya's first book, “The Return of Ancestral Gods: Modern Ukrainian Paganism as an Alternative Vision for a Nation,” is devoted to a new religious and political movement that strives to revive old rural folklore while creating an alternative vision for a present-day Ukrainian nation in both Ukraine and the diaspora. 

Mariya speaks about her experiences in Kiev in 2006 during a celebration marking Ukraine’s then 15-year independence from the Soviet Union, which inspired her to write “The Return of Ancestral Gods.” She describes the three dominant pagan groups featured in the book: RunVira, Ancestral Fire, and Native Faith. We discuss the political unrest that existed in Ukraine post-WWII, when many Ukrainians fled due to the fear of having their culture in the hands of Nazis and Soviets. We look at the subsequent crash of the Soviet Union that instigated a religious revival and a rise in Ukrainian paganism with a desire to connect to an alternative sense of self-identity. Mariya explains the differences of the three major pagan factions, which can be characterized by a focus on colonial politics and historical events vs. the revival of folklore and practicing aesthetics and the beauty of rituals. Further, we consider why younger pagans who identify as ethno-nationalists, separate from globalism, are more attracted to the non-political Ancestral Fire and National Faith. Mariya talks about the promotion of pan-Slavic brotherhood within the movement, along with the typical problems that modern pagans across the world have with Christianity and the spread of Western hegemony. We touch on the important pagan aspect of ethnic belongingness that goes against the American ideals of equality, tolerance and inclusiveness. Mariya concludes with some examples of how pagans are building a more powerful culture and identity through creating unique folk art and practicing sacred folk traditions.

Title: Motgift: Jonas, Dan & Magnus - Europe 2016: Attacks in Cologne & a Political Forecast - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=sMyP1SljoXE
Description: Jonas De Geer was born in Stockholm, Sweden. He's a writer, publisher, radio-personality and an activist and has been a leading personality in the opposition in Sweden since the 90’s. Dan Eriksson lives in Berlin, Germany and is Nationalistic writer, public speaker, podcaster and online video producer. He was a member of Svenskarnas Parti (Party of the Swedes). Magnus Söderman is a Swedish nationalist who is the author of several books on diverse topics relating to the struggle for Sweden, Europe and the Western world. He is a long-time street activist, political speaker and educator. During the last three years Magnus has been building Motgift with Dan and Jonas. 

Jonas, Dan and Magnus join us as we survey the events of 2015 and place the brewing culture war into context to measure up the prospects for the Nationalist movement in 2016 and beyond. The guys talk about the controversial subjects and taboo issues they’ve been addressing at Motgift and how they are working towards applying an antidote to the insanity that is denigrating Europe and Western civilization. We consider the defining moments of 2015 concerning the mounting migrant invasion, and what can be done to further expose and remedy this organized assault designed to change the ethnic and cultural makeup of our European homelands. As we have all witnessed a complete demographic transformation of the West within a couple of generations, we look into the horrific face of what will inevitably amount to more violence and dispossession along with increased militaristic tyranny if the destabilizing infection of Islam is not stopped. We take stock of the unthinkable events that transpired in Cologne, Germany on New Year’s Eve, which clearly demonstrated the irreconcilable culture clash swelling within Europe; a manufactured conflict that can be partially attributed to irrational policies enacted by a feminized government. 

In the members' segment, we examine the integrity of the Nationalist movement and what can be plainly seen as a liberalization of the founding ideals within mainstream politics. We discuss the politically correct kowtowing seen with parties such as the French Front National and the Swedish Democrats, which further validates the need for a much more radical alternative to the tired leftist rule. We speak to the strategic appeal of the New or Alt Right, centering on its ability to tackle controversial issues in an easy-going fashion while focusing on deeply traditional, uncomplicated values based in nature. Then, we dig deeper into the actions that must be taken in order to keep Europe from experiencing another full-blown Muslim takeover, the likes of which have been seen before, but have been obscured by academia’s disingenuous versions of history. Later, we look to the classic story of Beowulf and the writings of Tolkien to give us some perspective on the never-ending Earthly battle between good and evil that can only be won through determined dedication to one’s self and folk.

Title: Christina Hoff Sommers - Feminism & Its Impact on Society - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2016-01-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ipCJdk83Ia4
Description: Christina Hoff Sommers, a former philosophy professor who taught ethics, is probably best known for her critique of late-twentieth-century feminism. She is also known for her extensive writings, among them Who Stole Feminism?, The War Against Boys, One Nation Under Therapy & The Science on Women and Science. Her textbook, Vice and Virtue in Everyday Life, a bestseller in college ethics, is currently in its ninth edition. Her latest book is called Freedom Feminism - Its Surprising History and Why it Matters Today. She runs the Factual Feminist video blog, covering all subjects related to feminist philosophies and practices. Her #FactFem colleagues use a data-driven approach to the basic tenets of feminism and related topics.

Christina begins sharing the forgotten history of "conservative feminism" and "maternal feminism" during the 1st wave. We discuss the suffragettes and why there were many women opposed to them. We discuss a more accurate portrayal of the relationship between men and women in the suffragette era, as opposed to the radical feminist view. Then, we'll discuss 2nd wave feminism and how things went awry leading up to today's radical feminist. Christina points out the top feminist myths and denounces feminist mysandry and the all out war on boys. From male shaming to "men going their own way" we'll look at the damage modern feminism is doing to the relationship between the sexes and to society as a whole. There is nothing more fundamental & delicate than the relationship of male and female. Later, we'll speculate on what consequences, as well as backlash, may unfold to unchecked feminism and a culture of victimhood.

Title: Christopher Cantwell - Pro-White Libertarianism - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=tR17HAI0uOs
Description: Christopher Cantwell is an activist, writer, talk show host, and satirist originally from New York. Now living in New Hampshire, he hosts the Radical Agenda, discussing news and issues from a pro-white anarcho-capitalist perspective. Chris is the former co-host of the nationally broadcast radio show Free Talk Live, and his writing has been syndicated on Lew Rockwell, Economic Policy Journal, A Voice for Men, and numerous other publications pertaining to philosophy, politics, economics, race, and gender issues. 

Christopher first gives us a glimpse into the path that led him towards what he calls “common sense extremism,” which started with his involvement in the Free State Project, and later a journey down the rabbit hole of race issues. He asserts that left-leaning libertarians have an illogical association with the original and true philosophies of libertarianism that are based in the idea of private property societies. We discuss the faulty concept of open borders and the government’s program of mass immigration that is being fueled by economic incentives for cheap labor. Christopher addresses the adverse conditions that “diversity” generates when introduced within largely homogenous societies, and we consider whether or not the libertarian faction has the tenacity to stand up against subversive forces like Islam. Then, Christopher explains the r/K selection theory in relation to the proportions of liberals, conservatives and libertarians, and he links the subsidization of birth control and abortion to shrinking White populations. We also look at the definition of genocide and the UN’s planned demographic transformation of Europe, along with the realities of self-segregating cultures. 

In the members’ hour, Christopher gets into the center of the problems that are tearing apart Western civilization, namely the enemy of liberty, democracy, and the misleaders who are promoting social engineering programs designed to dumb down the masses. We talk about the Obama phenomenon and how his two-term victory could be chalked up to successfully appealing to the US’s lowest common denominator. Chris gives his perspective on the candidates for the upcoming US presidential election, focusing on how Trump’s rhetoric on immigration and race issues is helping to shift the Overton window. We chew over the conditions creating the divide that exists between left and right-leaning libertarians, and we contemplate what it will take to get the libertarian crowd to fully grasp the idea of White genocide. Christopher expresses some concerns with the Alt Right movement’s lack of focus on free market economics, and he gives props to its ability to drive a cultural dialogue that is unhindered by taboo subjects. Later, we look at the incredible potential for the West to retransform its culture and take back its power from the global elite.

Title: Robert Otey - Unscientific Cosmogony: Gravity, Quantum Physics & Einstein - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-pjwlhPjcak
Description: Robert Otey has spent the past 25 years doing research into alternative Cosmology. He is behind the YouTube channel, 77Gslinger, where he has close to 700 videos relating to the Electric Universe, Sacred Geometry, Cymatics, and the work of Walter Russell, Viktor Schauberger, DB Larson, Nikola Tesla and others. Otey is the author of two books, “Free Energy and Free Thinking” and “Gravity is a Myth and Does Not Exist; Electricity is the Only Force in the Universe.” 

Robert begins with an overview of the convincing evidence he has discovered that contradicts and debunks the flawed theoretical gravitation based/big bang cosmogony taught in academia. He states that his enormous body of work proves this is in fact an electric universe based upon the foundations of sacred geometry. He gives credit to the revolutionary free energy discoveries made by Schauberger, Tesla, Moray, and others who discarded the false models of explosion based, fuel sucking technology upheld to render astronomical profits for the world’s energy barons, war mongers and central bankers. Robert explains the main proofs behind the electric universe model and how these elements produce the effect we know as gravity. We discuss the model of magnetism, the field of quantum physics, and the nuclear atom theory. Robert talks about the two main foundations of quantum mechanics, The double-slit experiment and the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. We look at the idea of relativism in science and the deceptive language of mathematics, along with the history of Einstein and his manufactured science. Further, we consider the birth of the Nobel Prize scene and the corresponding rise of National Socialism in Germany. 

In the member segment, Otey gets into the heavily ethnocentrically promoted arena of Jewish inventions and the mythical “genius gene” that is supposedly responsible for a huge proportion of Nobel Prize winning scientific discoveries in physics. We discuss the cultural Marxist infiltration of academia and the shameless bid for control through junk technologies that is destroying Western civilization. We look at the achievements of Victor Schauberger, a nature based scientist from a long lineage of foresters, who engineered sophisticated tools based on his observations of the power of implosion. Robert touches on the subject of radiation and the nuclear scare scam that he says needs reexamining. We give some critical thought to the viability of free energy and what has been keeping this Earth preserving technology from replacing the current, colossally costly applications. Later, we examine the credibility of popularly upheld scientists like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, and we speculate as to why the bulk of modern scientific developments are keyed in on intensifying the death grip of control on humanity.

Title: Tito Perdue - The Ills of Equality & Extreme Democracy - Hour 1
Date: 2016-01-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6x1JAiKG_G8
Description: Tito Perdue was born in 1938 in Chile and he returned to Alabama in 1941 with his family. Tito graduated from the University of Texas in 1961 and spent some time working in New York City, an experience which garnered him his life-long hatred of urban life. After holding positions at various university libraries, Tito has devoted himself full-time to writing since 1983. He has seven novels published to date, and Arktos has published his novel “Morning Crafts,” along with “William’s House,” both of which are part of a four volume series. 

In this dialogue, Tito begins with the story of his life and times in Alabama and the inspiration that led him to embark on a literary career. We talk about the ideologies that America was founded on, with focus on the concept of equality that was in response to what was considered oppressive aristocracy. Tito explains his views on the shift away from natural order resulting from the push for extreme democracy, and we look at the debasing of racial heritage that has degenerated the fundamental values of Western culture. We consider the universal experience of racism and the nature of the human psyche that has been repressed because of the stagnation created from obsession with excessive material wealth and the absence of true opposition and conflict. We discuss the history of cultures who have failed to rise up in resistance to invasions and we look at the undeniable dilapidation that is currently occurring in the West as the refugee incursion intensifies. Further, Tito talks about the advancement of Islam and the psychological warfare that keeps Whites from questioning the viability of multiculturalism. 

In the members’ hour, we look at the impending extinction of Western culture as we know it, and Tito speaks about the extraordinary movement of national socialism in the 1930s. We get into the ills of feminism and the realities of self-segregation between differing cultures, along with the destructive transformation of America that began with the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Tito emphasizes the downfalls of “diversified” civilizations and says that the globalist’s control of the media is to blame for promoting the war on Whites and the heinous policies designed to discriminate against the founding blood of the US. We also talk about propaganda-filled Hollywood movies that are destroying the true history and mythos of European culture and the anti-White emotional programming that is endorsed through academia and influential media, such as the New York Times. At the end, Tito leaves us with ideas for strengthening the New Right movement and sustaining a merchant class of our own, that will drive its successful realization.

Title: Mike Walker - The Return of Odysseus - Hour 1
Date: 2015-12-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=sAICGCtQtAU
Description: Mike Walker is an author and poet who is the former editor of the “The Scorpion,” a renowned British new right magazine. He has written three plays: “King,” “Hitler’s Temptation,” and the newly published, “The Return of Odysseus.” Walker’s verse has appeared in a variety of publications and he has spoken publicly on literary and political themes. 

Mike is with us to impart his motivations for writing “The Return of Odysseus,” an adaptation of Homer’s deeply symbolic, mythological tale of the long-lost King of Ithaca, Odysseus, and the return to his homeland. We discuss the ages-old theme of a king coming home and inspiring a civilization to ascend from a state of decay into nirvana or a golden age, and we look at the vital aspect of culture, expressed through art, music, and literature, in affecting political change. Mike tells how the story of Odysseus, who is thwarted by the gods and lost at sea while Ithaca’s civilization deteriorates, connects to man’s esoteric voyage into his own soul. We consider the archetypal forces of “good” vs. “evil” and how classic Greek mythology speaks to the psyche of Europeans today more than ever as their nation states are being flooded to the point of cultural oblivion. We explore how lacking a righteous leader while being tricked into believing that democracy exists within a crooked establishment leads man to fear authority. We also delve into the power and advantage that culture holds over any rigid political movement in that emotionally engaging material can produce a more multi-layered understanding of the challenges we are faced with. 

In the members’ hour, we take stock of the general lack of art from the nationalist movements. We talk about how the established cultural framework has been shaped through the liberal agenda to create a mass obsessed with the satisfaction of carnal desires. Mike relates this soullessness to ugly modern architecture, and we look at how the inversion of natural order and true beauty keeps the mindless consumer from realizing the magnitude of man’s impact on Earth. In closing, Mike gives words of advice and encouragement for artists, writers and visionaries who are inspired to help overturn the hostile power elite, accentuating the key element of consistently working with the intuition.

Title: Red Ice Yule Special - Myths & Forgotten Traditions of the Winter Solstice
Date: 2015-12-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=q9EwJxt0kK4
Description: In this special Yuletide episode, most of the Red Ice crew – Henrik, Lana, John and Melanie (we missed you, Fredrik!) –joins together to discuss the significance of the winter holiday season today and what this important time of year meant to our ancestors. We talk about our childhood memories of Christmas and family teachings, or lack thereof, of pre-Christian traditions surrounding the winter solstice and return of the sun. Henrik describes the ancient Norse pagan ritual, the Blót, which included sacrificial offerings at Uppsala to the gods Odin and Freya, and Lana tells the mythical story of the Wild Hunt, with the flying 8-legged horse, Sleipnir. We get into the legend of Krampus, the shamanic aspects of Santa Claus, the significance of the colors of Yule, the burning of the Yule log, and other symbols central to survival. We receive a history lesson on the origins of Kwanza and Hanukkah, and we look at how Christmas has been culturally appropriated and manufactured into celebrations that hijack the ancient energy of northern European solar traditions. Then, we discuss how Hanukkah has taken center stage at the White House and we listen to a clip from Obama’s big liberal propaganda party that included PC holiday blessings from Susan Talve, a Rabbi from the Central Reform Congregation in St. Louis. Our conversation rounds off with thoughts on the importance of storytelling and practicing rituals, along with rediscovering and honoring the ancient Norse essence of generosity and clan loyalty.

Title: Insight - The True Origins of Kwanzaa, Hanukkah & Christmas
Date: 2015-12-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=VUDT1L2Iy9I
Description: In the multicultural west we are told to say Happy Kwanzaa, Happy Hanukkah and Merry Christmas or these days Happy Holidays as to not offend others. Lana tells about the true origins of newcomer holidays such as Kwanzaa and Hanukkah. Where did these holidays originate? Are they original? Why are they also in December, like Christmas? She'll also talk about the true origins of Christmas, which is entirely borrowed from Yule, the pre-Christian European celebration of the Winter Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. Kwanzaa, Hanukkah and Christmas are all imposters, culturally appropriating from the ancient European Winter Solstice celebration. Learn about the myth, symbolism and tradition of Yule.

Title: Patrick Le Brun - Front Nationale, Identitarian Activism & Successful Tactics - Hour 1
Date: 2015-12-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=BKMN6i4Brzk
Description: Patrick Le Brun is a writer and activist who has written many articles for Counter-Currents. He has extensive experience with the French Identitarian movement. He is currently based in the United States, where he mentors college students who wish to engage in activism. 

Patrick is with us to discuss some of the good news coming out of the French Regional election that took place on December 13th. He explains France’s unique election process with its two-round runoff system to elect the regional presidencies, along with strategies used by the Front National (FN) party. We look at how the European refugee crisis and rise in terrorist attacks have driven many voters towards Marine Le Pen and FN and away from parties supporting the globalist elites already in place. Patrick gets into the citizenship issues faced by native White French people, and he outlines a pamphlet put out by French Identitarians that is addressing remigration laws. We talk about the promising movements of post-communist European countries that are rediscovering Nationalism and rejecting the current elected officials’ agenda to destroy national identity. Then, Patrick illustrates the deeply corrupt state of the military industrial complex and the money that is being funneled into the Islamic State under the umbrella of the US and NATO. We also consider the incredibly harsh punishments that have been faced by people who speak out against organizations attacking the dignity of humanity, and what can be done to bring back power to those who are fighting for traditionalism. 

In the members’ section, Patrick talks about strategies that are making headway in the turn back towards European Nationalism and traditionalism. We look at the generational shift occurring in countries like The Czech Republic and Austria, where over 50% of people age 30 and younger are voting for Nationalist parties. Patrick outlines how we can think in terms of marketing to take back the visual culture of neighborhoods and reach potential comrades with analogous principles. He details the basis of his article featured on Counter Currents, “How Traditional Catholics Are Taking Back the Visual Culture of France.” Patrick emphasizes how the market for contemporary art has become a racket for the very wealthy to dodge inheritance taxes, and we discuss some of the downright degenerate filth that has been allowed to defile public places. We get into the tactics Identitarian activists are using in building relationships with organizations that can truly aid in the fight against cultural Marxism in all its disgusting forms. Later, we touch on the obstacles that revolutionaries like Marine Le Pen have overcome and what it takes for leaders to win the hearts of the people.

Title: Jamie Hanshaw - The Alchemy of Cultural Marxism
Date: 2015-12-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ceQ3kdXdV5w
Description: Jamie Hanshaw is a second generation conspiracy theorist who studies the occult activities of secret societies, the Freemasons, magic, sorcery, Kabalistic rituals, and Hollywood trauma-based mind control. She is a regular contributor at FreemanTV.com and she, along with co-writer Freeman, has compiled all of this information into a fully illustrated, well-referenced compendium of the occult mind pattern programming of Hollywood and the mainstream media in their 2-part book, “Weird Stuff – Operation: Culture Creation.” Their third book, “Hollywood Mind Control,” is nearing completion and will be released in 2016. 

In this conversation, Jamie and Lana discuss cultural Marxism and the war on Whites that has become progressively palpable ever since President Obama was first elected. We consider how this resurgence of racism, agitated by #BlackLivesMatter and #CheckYourWhitePrivilege propaganda, is clearly part of a social engineering plan designed to subvert and divide the masses in order to render race-less, easily manipulated slaves of the establishment. Jamie talks about how trauma based mind control has been utilized to pit women against women and further distort the feminist movement. We also look at the recent abhorrent article by Thierry Lecoquierre entitled, “Impregnate the Female of the National Front” that calls for the raping and killing of “right-wing poison.” Jamie emphasizes how feminism has led to the sexual de-evolution of women, and she touches on the theme of androgyny in magic, the occult and alchemy. Then, we get into “princess programming,” Hanna Montana and the grown-up degenerate, Miley Cyrus, and Disney’s destruction of the sacred feminine. Later, Jamie details evidence signifying the Muslim Allah is actually a goddess, the connection between Catholicism and Islam, and the new trend of American celebrities embracing the Muslim way.

Title: Pete Papaherakles & Victor Thorn - America's Racial Powderkeg - Hour 1
Date: 2015-12-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=LN8zP2YCLZU
Description: Pete Papaherakles was born in Greece and has lived in the US since the age of 9. He is a writer for American Free Press (AFP) and the Barnes Review, as well as an illustrator and political cartoonist and AFP’s outreach director. Victor Thorn founded Sisyphus Press and has authored 56 published books, including “The New World Order Exposed” and “9-11 on Trial.” He also co-founded WING TV (World Independent News Group) and is an investigative reporter for AFP, with nearly 1,000 published articles. “America’s Racial Powder Keg: How a Violent Dependency State Has Been Created Within the Black Community” is a new compilation edited by Victor, which includes 16 of his articles and 22 articles by Pete Papaherakles, along with a few others by Dave Gahary, John Friend, and Bill White. 

Pete and Victor are with us to discuss how “America’s Racial Powder Keg” came together and what prompted the different writers to address the very taboo racial issue that has become completely distorted within the Marxist educational system and controlled MSM. We look at the problems of race that have escalated dramatically since Obama came into office and how his bid for “change” has resulted in a hotbed of issues for “post racial America” that are being selectively ramped up by the media. Victor describes self-hating White liberals as the root cause behind the perpetuation of the narrative of evil White oppressors and inherent White guilt, and we consider how the establishment uses racial tension to disenfranchise the founding race of the US. We analyze how the media’s focus on isolated events such as the Treyvon Martin and Michael Brown shootings are undermining local control by police departments, bringing on federal intervention and furthering the Marxist war against nationalism and family values. Then, Pete talks about the brainwashing propaganda concerning slavery that conceals the real source of racism stemming from black slave masters looking to bolster their own power. We also discuss black crime statistics and the discrimination against merit that has been implemented through affirmative action. 

In the members’ segment, Pete illuminates our progressive move towards a fake reality that promotes the narrative of terror for the political agenda of the Empire. We talk about fear conditioning and learned helplessness that is programmed as a means to demoralize the people, and we look at the false flag factor that creates a kind of schizophrenic reaction to Islamic insurgence infecting the West. We get into the issue of pathological altruism and the fallacies of equality within the liberal belief system. Pete clarifies the history of slavery and asserts that Whites should discard the accepted storyline that blacks continue to be owed reparations. Later, we discuss the overall conditions that existed for sub-Saharans prior to their encounters with Whites, along with the racial differences that have allowed for the advancement of the Western civilization.

Title: Govan Kilgour - Islamic Invasions of Europe & The Heroes That Pushed Them Back - Hour 1
Date: 2015-12-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=E9mTaCUJ19Y
Description: Govan Kilgour is a Canadian researcher, writer, and vlogger. His work online for the past 8 years has largely been focused on health and longevity, but more recently he's been covering a wider range of topics that he sees as crucial to the future survival of Western European culture. His YouTube channel touches on everything from history to current world events, demographic issues, social engineering, and more. 

Our conversation with Govan begins with an overview of the unsung kings and heroes featured in his video, “This is Europa - 10 Underdog Heroes of History.” We discuss some of the hundreds of battles that have been fought between Europeans and Islamic forces, focusing on modern-day Middle Eastern 4th generation warfare tactics that have pulled the rug out from underneath the conventional West. Govan credits Europe’s refugee invasion as the impetus behind his current quest to reinvigorate the spirit of noble European heroes, and we look at the infiltration by Cultural Marxist ideology that has blurred the lines of traditional warrior myths. We touch on the Persian invasion of Greece and the role of the Byzantine Empire in protecting Western Europe from Islamic invasion. Further, Govan gets into Charles Martel’s victory over the Arabs in the Battle of Tours, Vlad Dracula’s brutal conquest of the Ottomans, and other important events that stemmed the tide of Muslim advancement into Europe. 

In the members’ hour, we discuss the perpetual state of crime and violence in Western Europe that is escalating as the incursion of culturally incompatible Muslims swells. We consider the serious problems Europeans face as the deceitful Universalist narrative leads its native populations down the path to destruction and replacement. Govan talks about the ruling elite that is behind the big push to permanently change Europe’s demographics, and he says that the Nationalistic mentality is the only mechanism for quelling the infiltration and dismantling we face. Then, Govan emphasizes the importance of physical strength and mastering self-defense, and the essential connection of mind and body in overall health. We focus on the differences in mentality of people from intensely violent 3rd world countries and those who are simply unaccustomed to conflict.

Title: Jay Dyer - San Bernardino Shooting: Islam, The West & False Flags - Hour 1
Date: 2015-12-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=w0OK_0mVgVU
Description: Jay Dyer is behind the website JaysAnalysis, which is dedicated to investigating the deeper themes and messages found in our globalist pseudo culture and illustrating the connections between philosophy, metaphysics, secret societies, Hollywood, psychological warfare and comparative religion. Dyer deconstructs these subjects in his weekly talk radio show, Esoteric Hollywood. 

The conversation with Jay begins on the lethal San Bernardino Muslim couple, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, and the media circus that was allowed to trample through the crime scene contained within the killers’ home. Jay talks about the intricate relationship between the media, the military and intelligence agencies, and we look at the inconsistent stories coming out from shoddy journalists. Then, we discuss the increase in violence and crime directly related to Islam within Europe and the many incidents that are ignored or covered up by the mainstream. Jay outlines the globalist corporate plan to open borders, and we consider how the false dialectic of mainstream politics plays into the religion of consumerism. 

In the members’ hour, we get into the chaos that has been created by multiculturalism and Islam in the West. Jay illustrates how ISIS affiliates have cropped up in countries formerly invaded by the US in the march for Middle Eastern oil domination. Further, we evaluate Turkey’s NATO-driven role in arming the forces aimed at overthrowing Assad and ushering in a new regime aligned with Israel. Then, Jay talks about the big picture of liberalism and the modern-day, anti-nature notion of interchangeable humanness that was scripted during the enlightenment and French Revolution. Later, we look at the establishment’s long term social engineering plans that are being rolled out through the educational system. At the end, Jay addresses our current cultural infantilism and the degeneration of popular entertainment.

Title: Jim Fetzer - Nobody Died at Sandy Hook - Hour 1
Date: 2015-12-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=TiWXubMfUI4
Description: Jim Fetzer, a former Marine Corps officer, is McKnight Professor Emeritus at the University of Minnesota Duluth. He has published widely on the theoretical foundations of scientific knowledge, computer science, artificial intelligence, cognitive science and evolution and mentality. He is the author and co-author of many books, including “The Evolution of Intelligence,” “The 9/11 Conspiracy,” and “And I Suppose We Didn’t Go to the Moon, Either?” 

Jim is with us to discuss “Nobody Died at Sandy Hook,” his latest book collaboration edited with Mike Palecek and featuring contributors James F. Tracy, Ph.D., Dr. Eowyn, Ph.D., Nick Kollerstrom, and others. Jim begins with details about the banning of his book by Amazon.com less than a month after publication and after nearly 500 copies had been circulated. He explains damning evidence presented in the book that exposes the corrupt Obama administration, and says that mass shooting events like Sandy Hook, Charleston and Roseburg are elaborate PSYOPs designed to instill fear in particular segments of the American population to push gun control agendas. Jim gives a rundown of the apparent staged setting of Sandy Hook Elementary School, where red flags abound, including indications of two-day FEMA drill operation, missing bullet holes in photographic “evidence,” signs the school had been previously abandoned, and more. We discuss clues pointing to a fictionalized killer, Adam Lanza, along with aspects of supposed family members and witnesses that appear to be fraud and fakery. 

In the members’ hour, which was recorded on December 2nd as the San Bernardino, CA social services employee party massacre was unfolding, we touch on the US’s mixed up and maniacal affairs with the Middle East and ISIS, Syria, Turkey and Russia. Then, Jim gets into some of the strange details surrounding the Boston Marathon bombing, and we look at the pervasive presence of active shooter drills and general state of confusion and inconsistency that have become the hallmarks of high-profile, deadly crimes. Later, we discuss mass Muslim migration into the West as an instrument of warfare and the schizophrenic reaction to the staged chaos that has been programmed into the masses. We wrap up with thoughts on the 2nd Amendment, Martial Law, and Trump.

Title: Scott Roberts - Who's to Blame for the Anti-White Agenda? - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2015-12-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=d-UGi9jy8eE
Description: Scott Roberts has been behind several YouTube channels, releasing around 2000 videos, addressing the agenda of organized elites. Many of his videos have been taken down by YT administration. 

Scott begins with the history of his YouTube channels and the censorship he’s encountered since he began broadcasting videos aimed at unapologetically exposing and dismantling the anti-White agenda. He talks about his awakening to the plot of White genocide. Scott explains how we are being governed by elites that want to destroy White culture, and there would be no Shabbos goy if it weren’t for the Jewish agenda. We consider the PC trend to identify as the oppressed and the psychologically conditioned persecution complex that prevents average people from exploring the hard truths of history. Scott brings forth the idea of incentivized malgenics as a key force behind White disenfranchisement, and we consider the hurdles intellects must overcome in waking up to the paradoxical narrative of diversity. Then, Scott gets into the top-down control of everything from the media to militia that keeps altruistic Whites from understanding the extent of the manipulation they have been groomed to do the bidding for. At the end, we explore different angles for spreading the message of European preservation.

Title: Sam Dickson - America & Europe: Price of Liberty & Error of Equality - Hour 1
Date: 2015-12-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=FTnsn3KCLqw
Description: Sam Dickson is a Southern historian and a prominent Atlanta attorney who has offered legal counsel to White activists in America. He attended the University of Georgia in the late '60s and was active in the conservative organizations Young Republicans and Young Americans for Freedom. He graduated from University of Georgia Law School in 1972 and opened his law offices in Atlanta. Dickson is a member of the Council of Conservative Citizens and has given frequent lectures at American Renaissance. 

Sam joins us for a discussion about the history of America and Europe and the current state of these civilizations. He begins by talking about the contradictions within the core values of conservatism. We look at the chronology of the birth of the American nation, the character of the European countrymen who left their native communities to build a new country, and the ideology of freedom that was indoctrinated in those who were looking to escape the crown. Sam explains how there was a natural market for libertarian type ideologies to flourish in the original American colonies. He says that Thomas Jefferson’s drafting of the US Declaration of Independence implanted the dogma of inalienable rights of equality and other senseless notions of liberty that go against natural law. We consider the attraction of egalitarianism and the fallacies of libertarianism, and we take stock of the quickly deteriorating liberal agenda that has enjoyed three generations of prosperity and peace. 

In the members’ segment, Sam emphasizes the great potential of the working class rising up with a new form of rebellion in response to the replacement level migration occupying all European founded countries. We discuss the driving forces behind the opposition to the rise of Nationalism, and Sam draws comparisons between the leadership styles of intensely loyal minority groups and the psychopathic Western oligarchy currently governing the majority. Sam brings forth the idea of artificial belief clusters that are created to divide any racial communitarians that could be actively promoting self-interests, and he talks about the three main types of propaganda that keep people’s minds shrouded from the negative consequences of multiculturalism and diversity. Sam also talks about making practical investments in self-interests, leading by authoritative example and gets into the passivity that exists within the US when it comes to preserving honor and culture.

Title: Matthew Heimbach & Jack Sen - Anarchy in the UK: Migrants Welcome, Nationalists Barred
Date: 2015-12-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Qz2kT2boq8g
Description: Matthew Heimbach is the original founder of the Towson University White Student Union (WSU). After finishing college, Matthew and the Towson WSU joined forces with other dedicated White activists to create the Traditionalist Youth Network (TYN), a group dedicated to defending faith, family and folk on high school and college campuses around America. 

Jack Sen started up British Renaissance after leaving the British National Party (BNP). He was formerly a United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) prospective Member of Parliament for Northern England before being unceremoniously, and quite publicly, suspended by his party one week prior to the General Election. 

Matt and Jack are back with Red Ice to discuss events surrounding the recent barring of Matt from the UK by the Home Office’s Theresa May. Matt was scheduled to appear alongside Jez Turner at the British Renaissance inaugural Patriots summit, which will be hosted by Jack on November 29th. Matt talks about the “extreme” ideas creating static around his reputation and prompting accusations of "anti-Semitism," "homophobia" and other thought crimes against humanity. Jack describes how the BNP recently pushed him out for being “too extreme,” and we look at the pervasive theme of grassroots Nationalist organizations coming under fire for gathering and threatening the Orwellian status quo. We get into the scary reality of “freedom of speech” and the absurd double standards of hate speech laws, along with the utter hypocrisy of “safe spaces.” Matt and Jack illustrate how the disingenuous left’s fueling of the mad march towards Western multiculturalism is by design for the internationalist agenda to subvert culture and consolidate power. We discuss the lunacy of Islamic caliphates being allowed to organize within Europe to preach extreme hatred for the native populations and carry out heinous crimes against its women and children. We round off the conversation with strategies for promoting peaceful cooperation and solidarity within the growing traditional Nationalist movement.

Title: Piero San Giorgio - Survive the Economic Collapse - Hour 1
Date: 2015-12-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7CbruwgC5FY
Description: Piero San Giorgio is a Swiss author and former businessman and software executive. For the past decade, he has studied the global economic system and its dependence on ever-expanding populations, debt, and resource exploitation. He is author of several books, including the best seller, "Survive the Economic Collapse.” 

In the first hour, we touch on the recent Paris killing rampage and the tactics that make these terroristic events possible. Piero points to the ruling Western oligarchy’s meddling in Middle Eastern oil interests as a key piece of the puzzle. We discuss the tribal nature of the people being extruded by the millions from this battle-weary region, along with the engrained brutality that is completely foreign to most Europeans. Piero explains how we are at the beginning of the final fall of the global economy operating for the past 70 years, and he says the Western way of mass consumerism and instant gratification has created several generations of weak people ripe for conquering. We analyze the mainstream media’s fueling of identity politics that has served to further divide an already atomized society. Then, Piero emphasizes how the hollowing out of morals through the implantation of ideologies like feminism and cultural Marxism is the nexus of what’s to come in the collapse. We consider the perfect storm that has been created by the exponential growth of the world’s population, paired with a global economy based in dwindling resources and debt, and compounded by the corrosive effects of mass immigration into a complex and fragile system. 

In the second hour, we continue looking at the potential variables of an economic collapse, including decreasing oil production, scarcity of nutritious food, and a lack of potable water. Piero illustrates how the US government’s disastrous foreign policy and financing of its military industrial complex fully demonstrates the magnitude of the crisis at hand. Then, he breaks down the way to conceptualize a global financial collapse and how to prepare by getting rooted in both the physical ground and one’s own traditions and culture. Piero covers seven elements for developing autonomy and living a sustainable way of life: securing a water source, growing food, practicing self-reliant hygiene and health, understanding energy technology, honing skills/knowledge and preserving culture for future generations, defense of self and family, and building strong social bonds.

Title: Insight - Migrant Crisis: ISIS & The Security Threat to Europe
Date: 2015-11-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oD0BT9kqXxI
Description: Henrik introduces an interview with Ricardo Baretzky, the President of the European Centre for Information Policy and Security (ECIPS) from May 2015, before the "migrant crisis" began. The discussion centers around the "Exodus Report" and the security threat to the EU after hundreds of thousands of young men have been flooding into Europe, creating unstable conditions. 

This interview was conducted months before the November 2015 attacks in Paris, yet this very possibility was discussed. The Islamic state had issued warnings earlier in the year, that they were going to use mass migration as a tool to execute further terrorist attacks to threaten the stability of Europe. Mr. Baretzky also warned that the values of Europe are now being threatened because of this unprecedented wave of migrants. It is a recipe for disaster.

Title: Ann Corcoran - Refugee Resettlement: "Diversifying" the West - Hour 1
Date: 2015-11-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gi5AeBW2MLw
Description: Ann Corcoran was educated at Rutgers and Yale Universities and is a conservative grassroots activist who blogs at Refugee Resettlement Watch, the go-to place on the internet for anyone wishing to understand the governmental process of the UN/US State Department Refugee Admissions Program. In early 2015, the Center for Security Policy Press published her monograph in book form entitled: ‘Refugee Resettlement and the Hijra to America.’ 

Ann joins us to discuss her important work at Refugee Resettlement Watch, where she reports on the mass immigration of refugees into America and the ongoing crisis in Europe. She highlights her research into the Virginia Council of Churches, a program that is responsible for resettling hundreds of mainly Muslim refugees in rural western Maryland beginning in 2007. We discuss the political ties of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) to the US Democratic Party, along with their underlying agenda. Ann explains the different meanings of ‘refugee’ and ‘asylum seeker,’ and she touches on the UN process for selecting refugees from different parts of the world for resettlement in the US. She talks about federal grants that are awarded to big corporations who seek to employ cheap immigrant factory laborers, as well as the taxpayer expense of importing impoverished families who are placed on the fast track to receiving welfare benefits. Then, we get into the federal government’s plans to ‘diversify’ certain zip codes across the US, and the HUD housing rewards that keep city officials and developers blinded from the long term consequences of accommodating completely incompatible cultures. 

In the members’ section, we consider the drastic warfare measures that have been used throughout recent history to keep Islam out of Europe. We discuss the current massive invasion of Europe, and the fact that Europeans are looking at becoming the minority in their countries within two generations if the rates persist. We look at high profile terrorist actions that make the global mainstream news and the everyday nefarious crimes stemming from invaders that PC journalists refuse to touch. Ann emphasizes that we are in an extreme situation that calls for a swift response, and she says that the only way is through the reformation of US programs for refugees and asylum seekers. Later, we talk about Obama’s proposed budget for the resettlement of 85,000 refugees this fiscal year, and signs that US governors are finally catching on to the absurdity and double standards of this agenda.

Title: Rachael - Semitic Supremacy & European Dysgenics - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2015-11-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=UfZO9DtTLYQ
Description: Rachael is a full-time student studying business. She created her blog, Facing My Own Reflection, almost two years ago after admining anti-Islam pages for a couple years. Her focus has been to catalogue some of her ideas, at first for the purpose of posting in internet debates. Over time the blog developed into a place for fellow red-pilled intellectuals, many of whom also run blogs and write, to share finished ideas. 

Rachael describes her lefty upbringing in California’s South Bay Area - a genuine manifestation of multicultural America - where Whites are a minority, gang activity is the norm, and reports of kidnapping, rape and murder are standard evening news fare. She tells how her Ashkenazi lineage merged with the very liberal mindset of the western US, and she highlights her understanding of different Jewish phenotypes and their origins, along with the varying ideological manifestations of Jewish peoples. Rachael talks about how she arrived at her anti-Islam stance, which began with a deep look into the root cause of the no-go zones cropping up all over Europe. We consider what is driving the insane and confusing politics of Israel and the Middle East by looking back to the history of Muslim interaction within this region. We delve into the deeper meaning of Zionism, the Kalergy plan for a multicultural Europe, and what the ethnically pure state of Israel stands to gain from the destabilization of the Middle East and the Islamification of the West. Then, we get into the fundamental differences between sub-Saharans and Europids, and we explore why leftists don’t oppose Islam even though it’s the antithesis of their utopian based ideology. Later, we discuss our current state of dysgenics and the decline in birth rates amongst highly intelligent Westerners. In closing, we touch on feminism, the role of alpha and beta males in high trust societies, and raising standards of living through eugenics.

Title: Mark Weber - Paris Attacks: Analysis & Consequences - Hour 1
Date: 2015-11-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-xgjEvY2ge4
Description: Mark Weber is an American historian, author, lecturer and current affairs analyst with a specialized knowledge of US foreign policy, international relations, the Second World War, and, more broadly, of twentieth-century European and American history. Weber is also director of the Institute for Historical Review, an independent, public interest research and publishing center in southern California. In 1988 Weber testified for five days in Toronto District Court as a recognized expert on Germany's wartime Jewish policy and the Holocaust issue. 

Our conversation begins with a brief overview of the recent deadly events in Paris and the intensifying conflicts Europe has endured thanks to the EU’s undying championing for diversity and tolerance. Mark gives a historical perspective on the growth of ISIS by focusing on the disruption caused in the Middle East by US powers in their lunatic pursuit of importing an alien form of government into a region with starkly contrasting cultural and religious standards and outlooks. We discuss Israel’s interests in creating mass chaos and disorder among ME countries, along with its conflicting relationship with the US. Mark says the hypocritical policies and alliances formed by the US have all but nullified its guiding ideology. Then, we bring our focus to the cultural suicide that Europe has set into motion as multiculturalism becomes its new religion. We look at the profound racial differences of Islam that are being infused into the national fabric of Europe, as leaders in their morally superior display of tolerance systematically divide this once cohesive civilization. 

In the members’ hour, we shift back to Paris and the many dimensions of war that have readied the Western stage for a dramatic battle with the Middle East. Mark emphasizes the role of society, its leaders, the educators and the media in supporting policies that have led to this social breakdown and chaos. We consider factors unique to multicultural societies that result in alienation, mistrust, and resentment, producing extremist radicals looking for somewhere to belong. Furthermore, the normalization of violence and the institutionalization of White guilt has created a battleground ripe for the dispossession of Europeans. Later, we discuss the upside to all the chaos being created by the refugee crisis, which is shaping up to be the shakeup the West needs to bring forth a revolution.

Title: Patrick Le Brun - November 2015 Paris Attacks
Date: 2015-11-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=TUe2VoI5rUo
Description: Patrick Le Brun is a writer and activist who has written many articles for Counter-Currents. He has extensive experience with the French Identitarian movement. He is currently based in the United States, where he mentors college students who wish to engage in activism. 

Patrick returns to Red Ice in the wake of the Friday the 13th terrorist massacre in Paris. He recaps the string of violent attacks on innocent civilians that have desecrated France since January's Charlie Hebdo slaughter, bringing into focus the reoccurring theme of radical illegal immigrants who have joined forces with the Islamic State/ISIS. We look at France's President Hollande's response to this wave of 4th generation warfare, along with his handling of the ongoing refugee crisis. Patrick sums up what could be in store for France's upcoming regional elections, where Front National stands to gain some major ground as Marine Le Pen makes headway with her stance against Islamist extremists and pledges for increased security with crackdown on illegal immigrants. We discuss the ruling Socialist party's harsh treatment of Identitarian leaders and how this this juvenile behavior serves to further reveal their foolish and dubious agendas. Then, Patrick speaks of events happening around France in the coming weeks where likeminded citizens can unite in support of the Nationalist movement.

Title: David Dees - Art Against the New World Order Zionist Agenda - Hour 1
Date: 2015-11-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Xwgb7Kq_Jic
Description: David Dees began his career as a commercial artist in the early 80s and has produced advertising illustration for Paramount Studios, Hanna Barbera, and Disney Home Video, along with cartooning and children’s book illustration for Sesame Street magazine, Family Home Entertainment, and TIME Magazine for Kids. In 2003, when Dees became fully awake to the New World Order Zionist agenda, he began fighting back with his own brand of activist political artwork and social commentary, with nearly 600 hard hitting and comical art pieces. David also designs and illustrates covers for authors of health, political, fiction and non-fiction books. 

David begins with the story of his NWO awakening and what prompted him to leave the Hollywood entertainment industry and pursue a life creating political art in Sweden, where he was eventually expelled once his provocative work caused too much commotion. Dees describes Sweden’s social climate and the typical self-policing, submissive mindset that keeps its people contained and unresponsive to the Zionist EU agenda to destabilize Europe. David talks about coming earth changes and deep underground military bases beneath Sweden’s vast forests and throughout the US. We look at the EU’s totalitarian foreign policies that have opened the floodgates to a Muslim ‘refugee’ invasion and consider the tactics of Organized Zionism in the destruction of homogenized European cultures. Then, David highlights some of his compositions, which address everything from 9/11 to anchor babies, vaccines, GMOs and geoengineered weather. 

In the members’ section, David continues detailing his artwork, including the Holocaust exposé series he has not yet released. We talk about the magical mind-controlling world of Hollywood, and Dees explains the deprogramming effect of his works. Dees says that we are at the cutting edge of expanding consciousness and the time is ripe for artists of all breeds to aid in an awaking of the programmed, reality avoiding masses while inspiring other creative souls. Then, we size up the social influences that shape Sweden’s culture compared to the US. We get into the Agenda 21 Wildlands Project along with the real threat of population controlling vaccines. Later, David gives us an idea of what to expect if we do indeed experience a magnetic cataclysm like Planet X entering our solar system and how to prepare. At the end we appraise the 2016 US presidential candidates and the revolutionary power of the internet.

Title: Millennial Woes & Lana - Friday the 13th Paris Massacre
Date: 2015-11-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2APcDxQ4v3k
Description: Millenial Woes is a GenX/Millennial Scottish guy pontificating about the world we live in, and are heading towards, through his YouTube channel by the same name. Millennial Woes, along with our own Radio 3Fourteen hostess Lana, joins Henrik to discuss the Friday the 13th Paris attacks and the state of Europe’s decaying multicultural experiment. 

We assess the purported orchestration of yet another mass casualty event by ISIS and the horrible frequency at which this sort of terrorist carnage has been occurring in France and across the West. We look at the utterly schizophrenic reaction that comes out of the liberal left every time Europe is desecrated at the malevolent hands of the Islamic State. We take stock of the crumbling shape of Western society as the absurd narrative of diversity and tolerance continues pushing its native people to the absolute ends of rational thinking when it comes to preserving and protecting its own. Our thoughts converge on the real threats of forced multiculturalism, now compounded with the Middle Eastern refugee crisis, and the naïve, nihilistic idea of all Whites somehow deserving punishment for the world’s perils. We look hopefully to the possibility of the Paris attacks helping to expose our weakened position and the insanity of welcoming radicals with a death wish to our doorsteps. We also gauge how this violent act of war by foreign assailants has in effect illuminated the irrationality of criticisms pointed at Marine Le Pen and her Nationalistic stance. As we cover the destructive forces of Islam, we recognize the exemplary standards and abilities of European society that will assuredly carry us through to securing a prosperous future, if only we can unite in strong, traditional brotherhood and solidarity.

Title: Cody Wilson - 3D Printed Guns, PC Hacktivism & Cultural Terrorism - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2015-11-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=T33d9Qmldmo
Description: Cody Rutledge Wilson, a student of law, political philosophy, and social theory, is a USA crypto and free-market anarchist. He is best known as a founder/director of Defense Distributed, a non-profit organization that develops and publishes open source gun designs, so-called "Wiki Weapons," suitable for 3D printing. USA Carry named Wilson one of America's "30 Influential Pro-Gun Rights Advocates," and Wired Magazine's "Danger Room" has named him one of "The 15 Most Dangerous People in the World." 

Cody speaks of his conservative southern Christian upbringing and what brought the power of anarchy to his awareness. He explains his impetus for creating the world’s first 3D printable gun and the State Department static he has encountered since making the plans available on the worldwide web. Cody touches on the filament modeling process and the printing of bullets, and we talk about these schematics getting into the wrong hands. We also consider the European migrant invasion that is bringing with it firearms into unarmed countries. Then, we discuss the potential for anarchism to embrace primordial traditionalism in breaking from hegemonic modernity. We get into the changing demographics of the US and what a majority minority means for politics in the country. Cody talks about how certain forms of new technology are being suppressed by the SJW political system and likens this conformist catering to an outgrowth of the Cold War. We discuss hacktivism, alternative payment processing, and the obstacles in separating from the capitalist banking system. Later, Cody gives his take on Trump, who he calls the “avatar of anti-politics,” and he shares what it’s like to live in the racially realistic south as neo-liberals fight to whitewash Confederate history and eradicate southern culture.

Title: Erin Elizabeth - Strange Deaths of Holistic Doctors - Hour 1
Date: 2015-11-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=WcyMrjkMxH4
Description: Erin Elizabeth is a longtime activist with a passion for the healing arts, working in the arena for 25 years. Her site, HealthNutNews.com, is among the top 20 Natural Health sites world-wide. She is an author and public speaker, and her stories have been recently featured by national networks. 

Erin explains how she began reporting on the series of mysterious deaths of holistic doctors after the beloved Dr. Jeffrey Bradstreet, a renowned autism researcher, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the chest in June 2015. The bizarre circumstances surrounding his alleged suicide, compounded with the deaths of two more holistic doctors within the same 72 hour period, prompted Erin to become one of the prime researchers in the Bradstreet case. This has now turned into an unintended series covering the deaths of 13 holistic doctors that have occurred in the past four months. Erin talks about Dr. Bradstreet’s connection to GcMAF, a controversial alternative treatment for cancer and autism, and his research on the link between autism and vaccines. She highlights some of the great achievements of the deceased doctors, some of whom were using chiropractic and other unconventional medicine such as cannabis. She describes this series of strange suicides, murders, sudden deaths and missing person cases, all of which bear hard to dismiss connections and inconsistencies. We speculate on the media silence surrounding these events and the motives for deep-pocketed pharmaceutical corporations to take out their competition. 

In the members’ section, we consider concerns that official investigations into these peculiar deaths have been corrupt, and Erin speaks about the collective pressure on holistic doctors. Erin shares how she got started on the road to health advocacy, along with her story of overcoming Lyme disease and excess weight through a holistic, natural approach. We talk about how the mainstream media pushes conventional medicine and why it’s so difficult for the average person to cast aside programmed beliefs and realize the detrimental effects. Erin says there is a promising shift to the acceptance of more alternative medicine as society is continually failed by the healthcare industry. We get into GMOs, glyphosate, recycling, and the toxic chemical compounds found in personal care products and processed foods.

Title: Lars Holger Holm - Sweden Yes! A Dangerous Battleground for Incompatible Cultures - Hour 1
Date: 2015-11-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=w7QkQ79Llj8
Description: Lars Holger Holm is a Swedish author and violinist. He has written on a variety of subjects, such as the European musical tradition, for publications like Svenska Dagbladet, Expressen and contemporary magazine Salt, and spent several years as a host on the classical music radio station Stockholm Classic FM. A number of his books are available through Arktos, including "The Owls of Afrasiab," "Homo Maximus," and "Hiding in Broad Daylight." 

Lars joins us following the publication of his latest book, "K䲲ingstaten," which can be roughly translated to "Crone State" or "State of Bitches." As a longtime deviator from the Swedish conformist mindset, Lars characterizes the rapid freefall of Sweden that has gained momentum since the enactment of the EU's open border policy. We discuss the 1986 assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme, an event that marked a turning point for Swedish society. Lars highlights his investigations into the historical rise of Protestantism, which he links to the implantation of a collective European guilt that has made Swedes particularly ripe for manipulation. We explore the conceptions of original sin, human rights, judgement, discrimination and equality. Then, we look at how the noble Swedish virtues of kindness and trust are being exploited as large scale migration transforms its traditional civilization into a dangerous battleground of social class conflict. We tie this together with Marxist based feminist ideals that discount European culture in general and spit in the face of the great accomplishments of its robust ancestors and remarkable innovators. 

In the members' segment, we weigh up the possible outcomes for Sweden in its shuffle to absorb tens of thousands of evacuees that are being extruded from violent, war-torn countries. Lars emphasizes the conundrum the country faces as many of these people go underground, setting the scene for a great criminal paradise. We discuss the grand scheme of globalism and the Kalergi Plan for a multicultural Europe, along with the costs associated with integrating contrasting and incompatible cultures. Lars illustrates how Sweden's emasculated governing powers are naﶥly steering its people down the road to an ethnic and economic suicide. We consider what it will take to get people to wake up and realize the madness of welcoming invaders with conflicting morals and intense animosity towards European culture. Our conversation rounds off with reflections on Swedish patriotism, the monumental impact of the Viking and Gothic people, and squelching the absurd narrative of White guilt.

Title: Lana - Lana's Llama: Non Toxic Clothing & The "Green" Scene - Hour 1
Date: 2015-11-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=cIE5gHZ4DHE
Description: Lana is the founder of Lana’s Llama, a US based, 100% natural fiber clothing line that provides an alternative to other brands that use endocrine disrupting, cancer causing and highly carcinogenic agents in their clothing. Lana is most well known as the voice behind Radio 3Fourteen and a regular contributor at Red Ice Creations. 

In the first segment, Lana describes her inspiration for creating Lana’s Llama, which stemmed from being highly sensitive to chemicals and the desire to find clothes made from natural fibers without carcinogenic chemicals added to the dyes and finishing processes. She explains the highly toxic ingredients in synthetic fibers, along with the dangerous side effects these petrochemicals can cause, including hormonal disruption, fertility issues, high blood pressure, gender-bending fetal development, and more. Lana outlines the standards and guiding principles for organic fabric production, and she talks about the ideological differences between cheap, high-volume Chinese manufacturing and the more expensive, low-impact production of slow fashion. Further, we discuss buzzwords like sustainability, fair trade and eco-friendly, and the misleading use of the term “green” that conceals the truth behind chemical laden products. 

In the members’ hour, Lana talks about some of the obstacles she encountered along the way to finding European operated garment manufacturing facilities in the US. Lana highlights the German origins of environmentalism, and we look at how international capitalists hide behind phony hippy left wing signaling that fundamentally rejects connections between nature and human origins. Then, we focus on the toxic sludge we are exposed to every day that is resulting in the poisoning and dumbing down of humanity. Lana offers natural alternatives to common chemically laced personal care products, and she details some of her favorite natural remedies for issues ranging from depression to skin irritation, adrenal fatigue, tooth decay, candida and much more. Our discussion ends with a call to action for merchants and entrepreneurs to aid in the preservation of the lands and commons our ancestors scrupulously built for us.

Title: National Policy Institute 2015 Live Podcast - Become Who We Are
Date: 2015-11-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ILwGsl6UekI
Description: Become Who We Are: The Identity and Spirit of Our People, a conference organized by the National Policy Institute and hosted by Richard Spencer, was held on Saturday, October 31, 2015 at The National Press Club in Washington, DC. 

Richard Spencer is President of The National Policy Institute (NPI) and Editor of Washington Summit Publishers and Radix Journal. Mike Enoch is behind the political and cultural blogs, The Right Stuff and Ovenworthy, and the weekly podcast, The Daily Shoah. Richard and Mike, together with Red Ice Creations team members Henrik Palmgren, the host of Red Ice Radio, and Radio 3Fourteen’s host, Lana Lokteff, participated in a live podcast/panel discussion at Become Who We Are. 

In this dialogue, the panel covers a wide array of concerns currently being tackled by the Alternative Right and the Nationalist movement, which has been gaining momentum as more and more Europeans begin to wake up to the reality of the dispossession of their people and motherlands. Henrik begins by addressing the refugee crisis in Sweden and the demographic suicide that is occurring at the hands of psychopathic politicians. Richard relates that as more and more people awaken to the raw deal of the status quo, the Alt Right path naturally opens up to provide politically incorrect answers and a proper opposition for aspiring rebels. 

As the audience raises questions, the conversation touches on the use of comedy for shaping an alternative narrative and, as Lana puts it, spreading the message through the creation of unique media, art and fashion cultures that stand apart from the lefty cesspit. Mike gives his expert advice on trolling, a form of ‘culture jamming’ that has become the movement’s mainstay technique for breaking through the absurd SJW firewall of political correctness. We also get into the validity of separatist movements and what it will take to convince Europeans to take back the reigns of their empires. 

Then, the panel concentrates on strategies for waging successful ideological warfare against the typical demonization of the New Right movement. Henrik speaks about Red Ice Creations’ forthcoming social networking site that will facilitate connecting like-minded individuals across the world. To round thing off, the audience seeks advice for countering the hostile globalist elite and winning the culture war, which the group illustrates can be achieved through building high trust within the community, demonstrating self-sacrifice, and developing passionate forms of expression aimed at influencing people who are truly ready for a radical shift.

Title: Andrew Anglin - The Art of Trolling & Satire - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2015-11-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=HUWLCXPTfBk
Description: Andrew Anglin created the website The Daily Stormer two years ago, which now attracts over three million unique visitors per month. The controversial and humorous website seeks revolution through the education of the European masses and keeps readers informed of relevant world events hidden by the controlled media. Anglin says, "My goal is that anyone who comes to this site laughs out loud at least once every visit." 

We begin with a look at Andrew’s journey through the alternative conspiracy route that brought him to the bigger picture of racial issues plaguing Western culture. Andrew talks about the recent heat that was brought to dailystormer.com when the SPLC tried to connect him to the Charleston church shooter, Dylan Storm Roof, and he covers the recent drama with Joshua Goldberg attempting to infiltrate the website. We discuss the art of trolling, tips for dealing with SJWs, and the future of censorship. Then, we get into the big problem of low IQ cultures creeping into the system and replacing skilled workers with affirmative action. Andrew brings forth the idea of ‘Detroitification’ sweeping across the US, as minorities take over the suburbs and ‘too White’ neighborhoods are ‘diversified’ through Obama’s new HUD social engineering program. Furthermore, we touch on the issue of low White birth rates and why Western women cheerfully support the mass importation of fighting age men from cultures with large breeding capabilities. Later, we delve into the unavoidable JQ and why Israel is so cherished by so many politicians. We wrap up with thoughts on strengthening the Alt Right political ideology.

Title: Ayla - Trad Women vs. the Feminist Lifestyle - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2015-11-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=s_BLObiLDIw
Description: Ayla is a former leftist turned fierce conservative, stay-at-home, homeschooling mother of 5 children. She is passionate about European culture, history and sovereignty, and strives to be a traditional lady. She earned a Bachelor's degree in German with a minor in Anthropology and a Master's in Women's Spirituality. Ayla is behind the YouTube channel, Wife With a Purpose. 

Ayla talks about her beginnings of being raised, educated and immersed in a very liberal, leftist world with a destructive and fake value system. She talks about the transition she made to conservatism through conducting independent research and seeing what happens to a community when liberalism is the pervasive value structure. Ayla highlights her path of discovering paganism and then the LDS way of life, and how she was attracted to the traditions honoring the masculine and the feminine that set both of these philosophies apart from mainstream Christianity. Then, we get into how the degradation of White culture, identity and pride has been amped up since the SJW movement reared its ugly head, creating a vacuum for the new religion of atheistic, materialistic, PC, mind-controlled, consumerism. Ayla relates what she sees in people who have abandoned faith and tradition and are clinging to a drive to acquire identity, only to find feminist ideals that go against the very grain of what most women are instinctually driven to accomplish through marriage and motherhood. We look at where the cultural shift away from the family unit and against traditional patriarchal values has resulted in many generations of women who don’t know the meaning of healthy male/female relationships. Further, Ayla underscores the consequences of feminized men playing in politics, and what the refugee crisis in Europe means for preserving European heritage. At the end, we consider the importance of sisterhood and celebrating ethnicity. Ayla shares her motivations for raising a large family and gives tips for homeschoolers.

Title: Syrian Girl - Why the Globalists Hate Syria - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2015-11-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=OIiwl8pMgW0
Description: Syrian Girl is a Sunni Muslim from Damascus in her late 20s, now living in Australia. She has a very popular YouTube channel, which she calls anti-neocon, anti-NWO and anti-Zionist. Our conversation begins with a comparison of Shiite and Sunni Muslims, and then we look at what life was like in Syria before the beautiful country in the heart of the Fertile Crescent was destabilized. Syrian Girl describes Syria’s relationship with its neighboring countries before the Zio-west invaded the Middle East, and she explains the oil pipeline conflict between Iran, Qatar and Syria that brought a money hungry war to the region. Then, we get into why Syria has been invaded, and we cover the eight reasons why the NWO hates Syria and the Socialist Nationalist ideals of the Ba’ath Party. We talk about the outside economic pressure that brought globalist capitalism and surges of foreign workers to the unique country, and we look at the long history of African migration into Europe through Syria. Syrian Girl points to the globalist conspiracy to destroy Nationalism via neo-colonialism and imperialism that is driving people out of their homelands. Further, we consider how multiculturalism is not working for Europe and why the humanitarians who are rallying for more refugees simply don’t understand the Zionist agenda behind the Muslim conflict with Europe. Syrian Girl discusses the demographics of Syrian exiles, along with the millions of internally displaced refugees that are living in camps within the country and in neighboring Jordan and Turkey. Later, Syrian Girl gives her take on Russia’s obliteration of ISIS forces this month, she explains the historical relationship between Russia and Syria, and we look at who is funding ISIS. At the end, we ponder what the Middle East would look like if the zio-west had never intervened.

Title: Claire Randall - The Cultural Marxist Model of Sexuality & The Biology of Gender Dysphoria
Date: 2015-11-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=inWJ9RSj1S8
Description: Claire Rae Randall holds an Honors Degree in Philosophy and Psychology from Leeds University, with a Graduate Diploma in Art Therapy. She has worked in psychiatry, mental health, and personal development, taught Psychology and Further Education. Claire is the author of “Waking the Monkey!: Becoming the Hundredth Monkey.” 

Claire joins us for Part 2 of the conversation begun with Lana last week - this time digging into the topics of sexual differentiation, hormones, gender studies, and trends. She begins by defining the brain’s amygdala, which is a trigger mechanism that can be manipulated in trauma based mind control. Claire then gives examples of research in the field of physiological psychology conducted to determine how hormones in the womb act on physical and neurological sexual differentiation. We discuss the estrogen mimicking chemicals that are increasingly polluting our environments and what effect they have on the sexual brain and female vs male hormones. 

Then, Claire describes the overall tone of university gender studies departments, where there is hostility towards any recognition of biological determinants in sexual characteristics and mainly social aspects are studied. She refers to important cases concerning sexual reassignment that are not included in gender studies curriculum, and she also gives some insight behind the liberal left’s political motivation to deconstruct all notions of gender and heteronormativity. We get into the controversial points of transsexual children, gender reassignment for kids, and the hardwiring of sex, along with the celebrated “reality TV” stars, Bruce Jenner and Jazz Jennings. 

Later, we analyze how to deal with the anti-White/female/gay politics of Islam that are cropping up all over Europe. Further, we consider how we can reach a balanced compromise in dealing with the hostility that exists between traditional conservatives, the alternative right and the LGBT world. At the end, we look at the wide umbrella of trans identities and the necessary attention that must be paid to neurological and developmental factors in changing public perception of this small, yet very vocal, portion of the world’s population.

Title: Juha Lindroos - The Environmental Impact of Mass Migration - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2015-11-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=HSg_mVAX57Q
Description: Juha Lindroos is a Finnish born teacher in the field of sustainable development with a Master's Degree in Corporate Environmental Management. Juha is interested in environmental philosophy, ecology and the language and forms of nature, and has studied the relationship between multiculturalism and sustainable development. 

Juha joins us to address the impact of mass migration on the environment, and why ‘environmentalists’ are leaving this topic out of discussions concerning the ‘sustainability’ of our planet. Juha describes how the traditional man in Finland is now somehow considered unsustainable and outdated, while the younger generation of de-masculinized males cheering for a multicultural society is suddenly hip. We consider where the original concept of socio-cultural sustainability has been twisted to vindicate the massive amount of energy and resources consumed by migrant invaders. We also look at the differing conservation attitudes of native European populations and those of African and Middle Eastern descent. Juha points to some disturbing examples of 3rd world immigrants failing to grasp modern concepts of resources and waste management, along with the Western liberal mindset’s blindness to the inept nature of these cultures. Further, we analyze the rapid, unsustainable transformation of Western society that has taken hold in our post-WWII era of technology and borderless White countries. Then, Juha gets into where the push for green technology as a cure for the ecological crisis we find ourselves in is missing the key points of biocentrism and a healthy balance between man, nature, creativity and progression. Further, we speak to the pervasive trend of ethnomasochism and White guilt in Western civilization, and how other prominent cultures have managed to avoid sacrificing self-interests and preservation. We round off the hour by considering demographic traits of masculine vs. feminine cultures, and we touch on the phenomenon of the cultureless, genderless modern hipster.

Title: Claire Rae Randall - Hundredth Monkey: Cultural Marxism & The New Age - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2015-11-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=pBEW1RMWOSw
Description: Claire Rae Randall holds an Honors Degree in Philosophy and Psychology from Leeds University, with a Graduate Diploma in Art Therapy. She has worked in psychiatry, mental health, and personal development, taught Psychology and Further Education. Claire is the author of “Waking the Monkey!: Becoming the Hundredth Monkey.” 

Claire begins by describing her lifelong interest in the esoteric and her background with experimenting in consciousness and Sheldrake morphic fields in The Hundredth Monkey camps. She explains how through her work she discovered the embeddedness of cultural Marxism in the New Age movement, and what led her to challenge these politically correct, leftist ideals. We discuss enlightenment and the Aquarian Age movement’s blindness to the psychopathic nature of conforming to a collective belief system that is subverted under the guise of peace, love and optimism. Then, Claire talks about the emergence of the 1960s counter culture in the San Francisco Bay Area, when Ken Kesey and the Grateful Dead reigned, and social experiments with LSD bounced back to create a movement rooted in self-reliance and community. We consider how this era has led to our current age of hyper individualism juxtaposed by tyrannical collectivism. We also look at our present-day issues with boundaries, which Claire proposes can be understood by looking at the simple biological and psychological principles of Systems Theory. Claire addresses the evolution of her own spirituality and how the works of JRR Tolkien inspired her to find a deeper understanding of the mythic and historical cultural roots of her own landscape in Leeds. Then, we delve into neurolinguistic programming in politics and the idea of the 100th monkey externalization of a coalescing archetype. Our discussion closes with thoughts on defining a personal sense of identity through rites of passages.

Title: Jay Weidner - The Imminent Fall of the West - Hour 1
Date: 2015-11-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5WJLviv9zpM
Description: Jay Weidner is a filmmaker, author and scholar who is known for his ongoing worldwide quests to find clues to mankind’s spiritual destiny via ancient societies and artifacts. He has directed, written and/or produced several documentaries, including Kubrick's Odyssey, and has been featured on the History Channel. Weidner is the co-author of “The Mysteries of the Great Cross of Hendaye: Alchemy and the End of Time” and “A Monument to the End of Time.” In 2000, he founded Sacred Mysteries together with his wife, Sharron Rose, and has since directed thirteen films, including the recently released, The Last Avatar. Jay is also Director of Original Programming at Gaiam TV. 

Jay returns to Red Ice to pick up on the conversation begun over a year ago, when we spoke about the coming collapse of the West and the destruction of Europe. Jay links this cataclysmic insanity to the Shemita, a 7 year recurring cycle that crescendoed with the defeat of Germany in 1945 and is now climaxing again in a final jubilee with the 2015 invasion. He contends that this numerological working is tied to the Kabbalah, the Freemasons’ conversion to Islam back in the Templar days, and the methodical destruction of Christianity. Jay highlights a few of the suspicious tragic events of the past 70 years, which he says are part of a deadly theatre designed and enacted by the NWO to bring chaos and ruin to Western civilization. We look at signals being sent out by Donald Trump and the technocracy indicating that we’re in endgame territory. Then, Jay talks about The Last Avatar and using propaganda to aid in our spiritual awakening. 

In the second hour, we continue our appraisal of the Hollywood machine and how its momentum and power can be directed towards ripping the lid off of the world’s evil influences. Jay illustrates what the modern art movement has done to destroy consciousness and create a degenerate and soulless culture of critique that we can now see in its death throes. He brings the story of Walt Disney into focus and explains why the brilliant man who created art in celebration of European culture was utterly hated and demonized by Hollywood’s elite. We also dig into the dirty underbelly of the entertainment industry, where layers of pedophilia, sexual abuse, and drug addiction are part of the recipe for producing movies with disturbing undertones aimed at perverting the minds of young children. Further, we look at the starring characters of Caitlyn Jenner and the Kardashian women in the agenda to destroy masculinity and gender roles, while simultaneously lending to the obliteration of genuine art and creativity. In conclusion, we discuss raising up the human spirit and honoring nature with traditional forms of art and storytelling in true rebel fashion.

Title: James Lancia - Downtown White Police: Why the Establishment Turned on Cops - Hour 1
Date: 2015-11-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7brDZZuR7iA
Description: James Lancia is a retired police officer who worked closely with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and Statewide Narcotics Agency as a patrolman in the Bridgeport Police Department in Connecticut. Lancia is the author of the book, “”Downtown White Police”: Demonizing the Alpha Cop, Glorifying Thugs, and Militarizing Law Enforcement.” James is also now a military artist, painting museum pieces for the French Foreign Legion. His historical military artwork has been featured at West Point and in various other US museums and magazines. 

James is with us to discuss the subject matter of his book, which is an exposé of the forces at work in American society that are leading us down the dangerous path to a militarized police force. James describes his work on a beat that included the sixth largest housing project in the nation, rated the worst in the country for crime according to FBI statistics. We discuss Hollywood’s demonization of law enforcement, the all-out negligent and false mainstream reporting of crime, and the black victimization narrative coming from elected officials that all work together in perpetuating the myth of the villain White cop. James gets into the harsh statistics of black on White crime, and he breaks down the lie of systemic White racism that is used to justify disproportionate opportunities and advancements for unqualified minorities. Then, we speak about the Baltimore and Ferguson riots, where police were told to stand down while rioting looting escalated to an unmanageable situation, creating the perfect scenario for a federal level, militarizing agenda to take shape. 

In the members' segment, James talks about the shift in crime rates that occurred post-civil rights movement, and we look at the growth of rape and violence in Europe and the US since the multiculturalist experiment has brought us forced integration. We also consider the problems of political correctness in bringing attention to and dealing with black on White crime. Then, we look at the ludicrous US foreign policies that are bringing arms to ISIS extremists and instigating soldier-age Middle Eastern men to mass infiltrate Europe. Later, we touch on HUD’s Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, the double standards of White privilege, and the war on Western culture. We delve into the tyrannical global government that is centralizing power with umbrella organizations designed to strip away localized police control and promote rotten misleaders.

Title: Ingrid Carlqvist & Conrad - Sweden, Get Ready for the Collapse
Date: 2015-11-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=s_tnv6CGKcc
Description: Ingrid Carlqvist worked in mainstream media for many years, before starting Dispatch International with Lars Hedegaard, in 2012. She is now a Distinguished Senior Fellow writing for Gatestone Institute. Conrad is a former leftie who currently is working on his bachelors degree in political science. For the past five years he's been preoccupied with the thought of the destruction of Sweden. He has appeared on various podcasts and co-hosts "Ingrid & Conrad." 

Ingrid and Conrad join us for a conversation about the absurd and failed multicultural experiment that is pushing Sweden to the brink of collapse. We discuss the pressure that the recent migrant invasion is placing on Sweden’s infrastructure and its most vulnerable native populations. As the new Prime Minister relentlessly pushes for Sweden to ‘take responsibility’ for the refugees that are flooding into Europe, a collective cognitive dissonance prevents Swedes from grasping the full reality of inviting the perils of Islam to an already crowded and dysfunctional doorstep. Conrad underscores how the good intentions of politically correct Swedes are being exploited by Muslims with serious superiority complexes and a deep disdain for Westerners. We consider why law enforcement has been stunted and corrupted by fear, while an extreme climate of conformity keeps citizens from rising up and fighting the insanity, and how the mainstream media drives this senselessness with emotionally driven propaganda. 

In the second half, we look at the programmed complacency and White guilt that hijacks any legitimate journalism from exposing the terrible truths surrounding Sweden’s dispossession and transformation to a multicultural society. We discuss how conflict is being manufactured to divide the unifying cultural fabric of Sweden, creating a land Ingrid calls Absurdistan, which encourages citizens and immigrants alike to nurse from an ineffective welfare and benefits system. We talk about the self-hating, neo-religious crusade that is propelling a political dialogue touting that Swedes don’t exist as a native people, and how this loss of faith is hurdling the nation towards a full on disaster. Then, we weigh up what it will take for Sweden to unite and fight to preserve and maintain the successful, functioning society that has attracted so many foreigners to line up for a piece of the pie. Henrik speaks about building a social network that will help people organize, connect on a geographical basis, and form societies that can regain control of Sweden. Later, we delve into the ridiculous gender dysphoria programming of the LGBT movement that is corrupting innocent children, slighting nature, and poisoning traditional nuclear family ideals.

Title: Tanstaafl - Race, Biology & Modus Operandi of Jewish Extremists - Hour 1
Date: 2015-11-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6mK_qFnr1jg
Description: Tanstaafl is a pseudonymous racialist blogger and podcaster at Age-of-Treason.com. He covers a general interest of science, history, psychology, and language, with a specific focus on Jewish influence. 

Tanstaafl first describes his personal evolution of unraveling the mainstream, politically correct discourse that has propagandized the origin of Europeans and reduced Whiteness to a nonexistent social construct. We look into how the fundamental European understanding of the science of human origins has been politicized and weaponized during the 20th century. Tanstaafl explains how the past science of race, which was based in rationalism and objectivity, has been psychopathologized, demonized and derailed. We discuss the Jewish saga of expulsion from societies across Europe since antiquity, and we evaluate the claim of oppression. Tanstaafl illustrates how Jews use mental word games to psychologically attack and intimidate any intelligent person who dares to question the Jewish parasitism that has crept into all facets of the government, corporate media and academia. Then, we focus on the 40,000 years of genetically homogeneous European civilization that has been marginalized by a politically correct shift from physical to cultural anthropology, resulting in the insertion of racial animosity and huge handicaps for scientists who wish to connect the past with the present. 

In the members’ segment, we explore more on the different origins of humans and understanding how the science of racial differences has been politicized. We consider where the manufactured problems of multiculturalism have created blinding ethnocentrism within Europe and opened the door for a dehumanizing transformation of the White European collective. We look at what it will take for Europeans to reach a critical mass of racial awareness and take actions to combat monsters like Barbara Spectre, who unapologetically advocates the destruction of ethnic European societies. Then, Tanstaafl specifies how Hollywood blockbuster movies are infused with psychological warfare designed to divide nations and move homogeneous cultures away from a kinship or biologically related mindset. Later, we examine why Scandinavia, and Sweden in particular, keeps getting pushed to accept more and more refugees, and how the beautiful, blonde-haired, blue-eyed sub-race of Nordics seems to be specifically targeted for replacement. We conclude with some thoughts on Ann Coulter’s calling out of official Jew numbers, and how top cuck Donald Trump is shaping up to be just another pawn in the globalist war game.

Title: Richard Spencer - Nothing Trumps the Invasion & NPI Event - Hour 1
Date: 2015-11-06

Description: Richard Spencer is President of The National Policy Institute (NPI) and Editor of Washington Summit Publishers and Radix Journal. He attended University of Virginia and University of Chicago and was a doctoral student at Duke University before dropping out to pursue a life of thought crime. 

Richard joins us in anticipation of Become Who We Are: The Identity and Spirit of Our People – an all-day, one-track conference hosted by NPI on Saturday, October 31, 2015, taking place at The National Press Club in Washington, DC. This event will focus on the importance of the Nationalist movement coming together as a community, face-to-face in the real world, to facilitate networking and socializing. Richard speaks about the timing of this movement and what is giving it momentum, including the reality of the dispossession of European people through refugee invasion, the criminal behavior of morally bankrupt politicians, and average people awakening to the raw deal of the status quo. We talk about the role of Donald Trump in de-legitimizing the conservative movement, his representing of the GOP, and the politically incorrect path he has blazed with his bold attitude about racial and cultural issues. We also look at the polarizing racial elements of candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, and the possible coming era of post-White politics and a new kind of socialism. Richard highlights the mirror-like qualities of capitalist America and socialist Russia, and he emphasizes how the Syrian refugee crisis is a blessing in disguise that is leading Nationalists toward a better understanding of themselves. 

In the members' segment, we consider what the future holds for European descendants that are experiencing a loss of domestic rights and control, cultural sterilization, and the homogenization of ethnic differences. Richard says that Europeans and Americans have been too comfortable and caught up in fantasies of universal peace, liberal values, and capitalism for all, and now the international allure of decadent Western nihilism is responsible for inviting in the negative aspects of multiculturalism. We discuss how to reawaken the revolutionary European spirit and inspire creative visionaries and the bourgeoisie alike to seize opportunities in advancing the Nationalist movement. At the end, we reflect on individual psychological changes that occur upon awakening to the reality of the racial war that is overturning society.

Title: Daniel Friberg - The Last Days of the Lunatic Left - Hour 1
Date: 2015-11-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Fe8ixXrldxA
Description: Daniel Friberg holds an MBA from the Gothenburg Business School, is currently the CEO of the Swedish mining company Wiking Mineral, and a founding member of the Swedish metapolitical think-tank Motpol. He is the co-founder and CEO of the British publishing house Arktos Media Ltd., and editor at RightOn.net. The English version of Friberg’s book, "Return of the Real Right: A Handbook for the True Opposition,” is now available. 

Daniel returns to Red Ice to continue our recent conversation concerning the return of the Real Right and how Europeans and Americans alike can be an effective part of the rising opposition to the lunatic left. We discuss Sweden’s position as the test lab in the deteriorating European multicultural experiment, and the growing awareness that we have arrived at a crucial point in history that demands a serious fight for survival. Daniel offers some advice for men and women of the Western world who have been confused and beat down by the rotten cultural Marxist system and its war on traditional gender roles. We discuss the consequences of modernity and feminist ideals that have led to a radical drop in birth rates over the past few generations. We focus on the monumental task of reversing the unsustainable leftist agenda that has promoted a dysfunctional European culture now threatened by replacement level immigration. Then, we take a deeper look at the social conditioning of the abusive educational system, and how we can encourage our younger generations to truly rebel against the indoctrinating garbage they have been fed by embracing traditional ideals. 

In the second hour, we discuss the situation in Syria and Russia’s recent moves to topple the Islamic state and ISIS. We talk about why Assad has been under attack by the globalist elite, and what’s next in line for the conflict if the US and Israel continue to push their destructive foreign policy in the Middle East. Then, Daniel gets into some of the absurd talking points of Swedish government officials that have been used to justify the country’s insane immigration invasion. We consider Hungary’s opposite and very Nationalistic stance in the fight to maintain secure borders and cultural homogeneity, and we look at how past territory wars have strengthened Hungary and its neighboring countries. At the end, we sum the progress that is being made by nations who are ready to be free from the liberal establishment of the EU and the Euro Zone.

Title: Vox Day - Social Justice Warriors Always Lie
Date: 2015-11-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=OSsUzG-fJTM
Description: Vox Day is a writer, a professional game designer and a three-time Billboard top 40 recording artist. He is the author of “SJWs Always Lie: Taking Down the Thought Police.” 

We'll discuss how Social Justice Warriors have plagued mankind for more than 150 years, but only in the last 30 years has their ideology become dominant in the West. Having invaded one institution of the cultural high ground after another, from corporations and churches to video games and government, there is nowhere that remains entirely free of their intolerant thought and speech policing. Vox explains how the SJW agenda of diversity, tolerance, inclusiveness, and equality flies in the face of both science and observable reality. We also anticipate the new frontier for SJW's and talk about Salon's piece by a self-confessed pedophile to explain his urges in sympathetic terms, “I’m a Pedophile, But Not A Monster.” 

Later, Vox gives the 3 laws of a SJW and lays out their operating system: always lie, always double down and always project. He gives advice on what to do when SJW's attack, usually hoping it will result in social ostracism and the loss of employment for the attackee. Vox provides the keys to counterattack.

Marcus Follin is a Swedish body builder behind the popular YouTube channel, The Golden One. He studies Economics and is a contributor at RightOn.net, an online resource for the rising True Right of Europe. Marcus joins us for a discussion about self-improvement, health, politics, Nationalism, and the sad state of affairs in Sweden. 

Our conversation begins with Marcus describing how the epic heroes of his childhood inspired him embrace Nationalism. We look at the rather myopic people of Sweden, plagued with the inability to see the larger picture of the immigration invasion and the establishment’s plan for replacing their population. We discuss the common rhetoric that Europeans are inherently evil, perpetual oppressors who should be upheld to different standards than the rest of humanity. We speak about the educational system’s conspiracy by omission that is training up a whole culture of White guilt. Then, we envisage where things are heading with the refugee invasion in Sweden, and how the foreign elements coming into the native culture are weakening and eroding an already pathologically complacent people. We consider the real threat of Europe being absorbed by Islam, and Marcus stresses the importance for young Swedish men to rekindle the Viking and Goth within, to fight for their nation. Marcus illustrates how the highly atomized and hyper-individualized men of Sweden can take a page from the playbook of Middle Eastern tribalism to network and build up and a stronger sense of brotherhood. 

In the members’ portion, we focus on the history of European uprising and what it will take for political parties like the Swedish Democrats to gain more support and power. Marcus emphasizes the opportunities that are presented by the country’s desperate situation, and he says that promoting economic policies that make it more feasible for working parents to raise large families are needed to resolve Europe’s sinking birth rates. Then, we shift to the Syrian disaster, America’s funding of anti-Assad rebel forces, and Russia’s recent master move against ISIS. Further, we consider the pan-European movement being pushed by the EU, with its absurd border policies that have opened the floodgates of the Middle East to effectively depopulate the area for what looks to be the benefit of Israel. We finish our conversation on the physical fitness aspect of self-improvement with weight training tips, goals, and means to maintain a respectful bond with Mother Nature.

Title: Colin Flaherty - The Untold Story of Black on White Crime - Hour 1
Date: 2015-10-31
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=BidvZxg3i-0
Description: Colin Flaherty is the award winning author of the bestselling books “White Girl Bleed a Lot” and “Don’t Make the Black Kids Angry.” His story on how a black man was unjustly convicted of trying to kill his White girl friend resulted in his release from state prison and was featured on NPR, the Los Angeles Times and Court TV. Colin joins us for a discussion about the rather painful topics of his two books - Black mob violence and Black on White crime - subjects that the media generally ignores, denies, excuses, condones and even lies about. 

We begin by considering how the myth of black victimization, racial hostility in the mainstream media, and the relentless narrative of White supremacy and racism have all contributed to the escalating problem of black mob violence. Colin describes when he first started noticing that the real details behind racially charged riots, violence and assaults are not given proper consideration by journalists covering these stories. We discuss how #BlackLivesMatter spawned the justification of extreme hostility directed at police. Then, Colin talks about an overwhelming amount of video evidence that is continually surfacing and showing an astounding number of accounts of racial harassment and violence committed at the hands of aggressive black culprits. We also get into America’s lack of understanding about the immigration crisis in Europe and the fact that as more Muslims are welcomed into White countries, inevitably more hostility and chaos will ensue. 

In the members' segment, we look at the crazy amount of black crime and violence wreaking havoc in many major US cities and now even small towns. Colin gives details concerning black on White crime statistics, and he points to enormous double standards in reporting that ignores evidence, encourages the "I didn't do nothing" mentality, and depicts the sinners as saints. We look at how the de-policing of crime-ridden black neighborhoods and the “diversifying” of White neighborhoods is increasing crime while perpetuating the relentless story of blacks as the victims of White racism. Then, we take stock of the disingenuous reporting on the crime and nasty behavior of Muslim immigrants. Colin calls the refugee invasion in Europe a “demographic time bomb” planted by forces that seek to destroy Whites and Western civilization. At the end, we chew over race conscious programming ideas like unconscious racism and microaggressions, and Colin shares some disturbing examples of the appalling “knockout game.”

Title: Andrew Auernheimer - Black Hat Hacking: Survival of the West, Syria & #GamerGate - Hour 1
Date: 2015-10-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=mzOeZ4Fmkyk
Description: Andrew Auernheimer, otherwise known as Weev, is an internationally notorious nationalist performance artist and “a menace on the internet” according to US Attorney Zach Intrater. Andrew joins us for a talk about black hat hacking, the future of Europe, Gamergate, and the world of trolling. 

Andrew begins by sharing how his past black hat activities led him to becoming a defender of Western civilization. He speaks about the culture of computer science and technology, and describes his role in exposing AT&T’s negligent publishing of customer data in 2010 that resulted in his arrest and imprisonment. Andrew highlights how a new wave of affordable technological advancements is opening the door for atomically precise manufacturing, which will usher in a drastic change in warfare as a whole. He says that this revolution will demand a great deal of computer programmers and is good news for this predominately White niche. We take stock of the European refugee invasion and the complexities of integration, along with the media’s use of emotional blackmail to mask the mess. Further, we speak to the influence of Donald Trump and his calling out of the immigration situation in America. Then, Andrew gives his take on the climate of countries that are defying rules of the EU and closing borders, and he sums up what is really driving the Syrian revolution and creating the massive population displacement. 

In the members’ section, we continue with an assessment of the dire situation in Europe and the hurdles that must be overcome in order to preserve Western civilization as we know it. Andrew depicts some of the cultural differences between Syrian Sunnis and Alawites, and he illustrates the foolishness of forcing multiculturalism on ethnically incompatible people. He also gets into the troubles of Bashar al-Assad's regime, the glaring involvement of Israel in the ISIS conspiracy, and the threat of Sharia zones cropping up within Europe. Later, Weev gives the lowdown on the big Gamergate scandal, outlining how the movement has aided in turning a whole generation to distrust mainstream media. We also discuss the new right’s abandonment of propriety and their use of confrontational visual communication in exposing the lies of the media at large. At the end, Andrew characterizes the tactics of trolling and clarifies how this provocative method for destroying the narrative of the opposition can ultimately uphold noble European virtues.

Title: Dr. David Duke - Manufactured Crisis in Europe & True Human Rights - Hour 1
Date: 2015-10-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=4kbJIi0X_SI
Description: Dr. David Duke is a graduate of Louisiana State University with a BA in History. He earned an honorary Doctorate in History from the University of Kiev, Ukraine. Duke is a former member of the House of Representatives from Louisiana and is the author of the books “Jewish Supremacism,” “My Awakening” and “The Secret Behind Communism.” Duke returns to the Red Ice to pick up on the recent Radio 3Fourteen broadcast that focused on the preservation of European people, values and culture, understanding human diversity, and recognizing the opposing occupying enemy force of Zionism. 

In the first segment, we evaluate the ongoing migrant surge into Europe and the destructive impact of this unprecedented invasion. David explains how this mass movement of people across European borders essentially equates to genocide, and he points to the very un-European Globalist tyrants in power, aided by the Zionist corrupted media, as the ultimate evil force driving towards the annihilation of European people. We talk about the irrefutable presence of Israel at the core of the war crisis in Syria, along with other notable Middle Eastern conflicts that have resulted in major population displacements. David highlights the hypocrisy of Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refugee policies, making special note of the power the small Jewish faction has in pushing forth damaging immigration policies for the West. We look back to 9/11 and the US bombing of Afghanistan – events that mark a major transition to the Israeli supremacist ideal of multi-ethnic states for all, except for Israel. Further, David calls attention to the destruction and murder carried out by radical Zionists throughout history. We discuss the demonizing programming of the global media that has created a vicious, European-hating culture, and David emphasizes the need for understanding the overall divide and conquer tactics of the current immigration invasion. 

In the members’ section, we get into recent mainstream events that have brought attention to Israel’s standing at the helm of global power, and we consider how Jews, who represent only 0.2% of the world’s population, manage to occupy a vast number of positions in US government and the banking industry. David reports on some of the racially prejudiced content found in Jewish tribalist publications, along with the open boasting of their leading role in organizations and movements that undermine the family friendly culture of Europe. Then, we look at how to cleanse ourselves of the evil portrayal of European interests and promote a rhetoric based in the true sense of human rights. At the end, David talks of flipping the lexicon back against our enemy and creating an opposition that speaks to European morality and survival.

Title: Insight - School Attack in Sweden: an Opportunity for the Establishment
Date: 2015-10-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=nTIt_aOEapM
Description: In the town of Trollh䴴an, Sweden, two people were killed and several children injured after a man wearing a costume entered a school and attacked them with a sword. Henrik and Conrad discuss this event and how the media and political establishment revel in the opportunity to pin this on their ideological enemies. Despite that very few connections have been confirmed, the media has been quick to link the perpetrator to "right-wing extremism," in order to silence those critical of the multicultural experiment. Actually, this violent outburst is further evidence of its failure. After a summer of open borders and a flood of migrants in Europe, the once peaceful country called Sweden is getting closer and closer to a complete collapse.

Title: Jayme Liardi - Millennial Rebellion: Confessions of a Former Liberal - Hour 1
Date: 2015-10-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=q8y0ZPvwNa8
Description: Jayme Louis Liardi holds a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Humanities and Theatre Arts from Stony Brook University. He is the author of “Revelation: A Return to Virtue,” a book geared towards inspiring disillusioned millennials to challenge the degenerate cultural conditions dominating the modern world today. Jayme is with us to continue the conversation that was begun with Lana on Radio 3Fourteen, this time expanding upon the ideas of finding honor in one’s self and inducting into an authentic life by rejecting the politically correct, cultural Marxist nonsense that is working to destroy the European spirit. 

Jayme gives some insight into the state of the university system, where everything that the West stands for has been commandeered under the guise of critical thinking and what is being taught by the liberals is actually pushing towards the destruction of the environment and sustainability, minority rights, equality and justice. We discuss the symptoms of our decaying world, and Jayme offers a bit of inspiration for those who are feeling lost and suffering from the poisoning effects of the manipulative mainstream. We consider what it takes to wake up and arrive at the truth seeking path, to fight the control of the establishment, abandon silly materialistic distractions and the need for acceptance in exchange for doing what is right instead of what is comfortable. We also examine the typical mindset of the millennial generation, most of whom are detached from a true sense of community and sedated by gadgets and decadent influences, but also a growing number that are feeling a sense of urgency to change this selfish way of existence. 

In the members’ segment, we again assess the climate on today’s college campuses, where students are programmed to believe somehow there are design flaws in humans that need to be removed, and there is a pervasive religious hive mentality preaching left minded behavioral and speech protocols. Jayme touches on the idea of “love thy enemy” and how truly understanding critical points in recent history unveils the infection of the Judaic cult that has been festering since the dawn of Christianity. We look at some of the demonized aspects of European history, and why the global establishment has worked so hard to erase race differences, hijack storytelling, and drive a wedge between humans and the laws of nature. Our time ends with a call to action for those who are ready to be representatives of nature and nobly contribute to the collective good of our tribe.

Title: Kevin MacDonald, Tim Murdock & John Friend - Invasion of Europe
Date: 2015-10-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1JRrbwi3xfM
Description: Dr. Kevin MacDonald, Ph.D. in Biobehavioral Sciences, is the editor and chief contributor of The Occidental Observer, which presents original content touching on themes of white identity, white interests, and the culture of the West. Tim Murdock is the host of White Rabbit Radio and the voice of Horus the Avenger, bringing awareness to White genocide through the widely circulated memes, "Diversity is a code word for White genocide" and "Anti-racist is a code word for anti-White” and other popular animations. John Friend is an independent blogger and journalist who maintains The Realist Report, focusing primarily on the events of 9/11, WWII revisionism, media deception and psychological warfare, power and influence of the Zionist Lobby in America, and the systematic assault upon traditional Western European civilization. 

In this special roundtable discussion, we focus on the burgeoning immigrant invasion of Europe and the controlled mainstream media’s contrived web of lies covering the mess. We begin with a look at the design and tactics of the campaign that is pulling on the heartstrings of White Europeans, and signs that the official narrative is beginning to crumble as people wake up to the absurdity of the situation. John describes the press’ coverage of the crisis, which plainly indicates their ruling elites’ central role in promoting the resettlement of non-Whites in Europe and America. We discuss the absence of any MSM video footage that would shine a negative light on the hostile 'refugees,' a majority of whom are extremely aggressive male Muslims with a particular disdain for Europeans. 

We get into the attacks on US presidential candidate Donald Trump for his open support of White interests, along with the hypocrisy of the outspoken political elite in regards to the demographic and economic questions of the immigration debate. Further, we look at the speed in which the Zionist agenda to overthrow the Middle East using Western capital is moving, and Tim points to indications that the managerial class is growing suspicious of the global agenda and the mission of multiculturalism for only European countries. Kevin emphasizes the history of cataclysmic social upheaval that has been created by Jews, and the ideology of past movements that have been aimed at deconstructing the ethnicity of the Western people. Then, our focus turns toward simple memes that can be used to counteract the psychological warfare that has brainwashed society to believe in the utopian dream of diversity. To round things off, we speculate on what moves the hostile elite could have up their sleeves in what is shaping up to be a full-on clash of civilizations on European homelands.

Title: European Women Speak Out on Leftist Lies - Radio 3Fourteen
Date: 2015-09-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=PFeNOFhTAPY
Description: Megan and Sinéad return to Radio 3Fourteen in bold fashion to continue the conversation about the current crushing immigrant invasion of European countries and the mounting war on Whites. We begin by calling attention to the main enemy of White interests, along with the absurd double standards of ‘White privilege.’ We discuss how the radical feminist movement has managed to infiltrate and infect the traditional patriarchal values that have traditionally upheld the interests of White women and children. Sinéad and Megan give disturbing examples of the leftist programming in universities and the mainstream media that is instructing people to excuse the rape of and violence towards White European women and children by aggressive foreign invaders. Furthers, we consider how the innate element of female guilt has been twisted into a trendy hatred towards the White populace. Then, Sinéad talks about her recently released public service announcement, White Women Are Getting Fed Up, featuring herself, Lana and Megan, which is designed to blast apart the lie of White privilege and bring attention to the reality of White genocide. We discuss the ruin and demoralization of White folk that is occurring because White women are encouraged to breed outside of their race, and we underscore the unnatural problems created by the multicultural experiment and the special privileges afforded to the burgeoning non-White inhabitants of European countries.

Title: Daniel Friberg - Return of the Real Right: Metapolitics & Rising Opposition - Hour 1
Date: 2015-09-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=xPgO6kb381U
Description: Daniel Friberg holds an MBA from the Gothenburg Business School, is currently the CEO of the Swedish mining company Wiking Mineral, and a founding member of the Swedish metapolitical think-tank Motpol. He has a long history within the Swedish Rightist opposition, and was one of the founders of the traditionalist publishing house, Arktos Media Ltd. He is also the author of the recently published "Högern kommer tillbaka: Handbok för den äkta oppositionen,” and its forthcoming English translation, "Return of the Real Right: A Handbook for the True Opposition.” 

Daniel is with us for a conversation about the rapid transformation of Europe that is underway due to the swelling immigration crisis, and strong indications that Europeans are finally waking up to the madness of the situation. Friberg recounts his first encounters with multiculturalism in Sweden and what prompted him to dedicate his life to constructively counterbalancing the opposition to the leftist lunacy that favors the replacement of its population. We discuss the dishonesty of the Swedish mass media and malicious propaganda that has kept its citizens in a collective trance, unable to see the grim consequences of unfettered immigration. Daniel emphasizes the importance of understanding metapolitics in navigating our current discourse - an angle that has been fundamentally neglected by the leftist dominated cultural sciences. We consider the political elite’s overt agenda to mix out the White European race, and Daniel breaks down Sweden’s cultural Marxist-ruled political structure. 

In the members’ hour, Daniel continues on the subject of the so-called Syrian refugee crisis, which can be deduced to an all-out invasion and involuntary conversion of Europe. We get into the violent and destructive track record of the Islamic state and its ongoing, escalating conflict with Europe that cannot be ignored when sorting out the mess of Western civilization. We delve into the psychological warfare used in the push towards a multiculturalized world, along with the rising popularity of pro-European attitudes in favor of protecting and restoring its own traditional culture. Then, we look the increasing support of the Swedish Democrats and what the party’s politically correct shift means for the real right. We deliberate the mainstream media’s deceitful coverage of the social conflict created by mass immigration, and look hopefully to the unavoidable death of the old ways that will be crucial to the rebuilding of Europe.

Title: Kim Dortch & Melody Kramer - Update on Dortch Family Battle with Riverside County Police
Date: 2015-09-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=s2DpmfauLRc
Description: Kim Dortch, a nurse and nutritional therapy practitioner, and her husband, Dave, an optometrist, appeared on Red Ice Radio in October 2014 to tell the horrific story of the ongoing police harassment they had endured since their 12-year-old son was arrested and charged for graffiti “vandalism” in Riverside County back in March of 2013. The Dortch’s attorney, Melody A. Kramer is a veteran trial lawyer, having handled criminal cases and civil business disputes in federal, state, and tribal courts for over 20 years. She is a graduate of the University of Nebraska, College of Law in Lincoln, Nebraska, and was awarded The Order of Barristers for excellence in the art of courtroom advocacy. Ms. Kramer is completing her latest book that will be an exposé on the nature of lawyers - “Why Lawyers Suck and What You Can Do About It.” 

Kim and Melody are with us for an update on the grim and perplexing situation that has unfolded since November 1, 2014 when Dave was originally arrested for a crime essentially manufactured by Riverside County police. Melody describes the blowback she encountered when filing court documents in the Dortch’s civil rights and now two criminal cases, along with the glaring errors, anomalies and conflicts of interest within the court system that have made for a clearly corrupt case impossible to navigate. Kim explains the unlawful arrest and imprisonment of Dave that occurred on September 1, 2015 after he peacefully walked out of a courtroom where a judge refused to produce any legally binding documents in the case against him. She recounts the brutal arrest by a “fugitive warrant enforcement team” in Dave’s place of business, where he was maliciously forced into custody, detained in chains for two days, and held without bail. Melody goes on to explain how the presiding judge forcefully appointed a public defender for Dave against his wishes, then proceeded to suspend the case and order a 45-day psychiatric hold in jail and a mental competence evaluation by county paid psychiatrists. Further, Kim touches on the US’s corporatized government and constitution and the federal grant money awarded to state-run departments willing to contract with and feed the totalitarian machine.

Title: Dan Roodt - Lethal Weakness of Altruism: Europe Overrun & South Africa’s Extreme Unrest - Hour 1
Date: 2015-09-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6kPy0UZdKZg
Description: Dan Roodt is an Afrikaner author, publisher, and commentator who studied at the University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Paris VIII. He is the co-founder of the website and publishing company PRAAG (Pro-Afrikaans Action Group). Roodt is also the author of numerous books and publications, and his latest essay, “Raiders of the Lost Empire,” examines South Africa’s “new” post-apartheid English identity. 

Dan joins us for a discussion about the immigrant invasion crisis in Europe and South Africa’s dismal state of extreme social unrest and violence. In the first hour, Dan describes the major issues plaguing the Afrikaner population of South Africa, where the current government’s hostility towards White Afrikaners has created a full-blown clash of civilizations. Dan details the so-called Africanization of South Africa being exhorted by the ANC, which seeks to eradicate the Afrikaans language and prevent Whites from mutual inclusion in the country they founded, funded and developed over the past 350 years. We discuss the mass migration out of Africa that is quickly altering the demographics of the Western world and bringing with it the economic weight of a 2 billion strong population severely lacking in productivity and capital. Then, we get into the left-wing cultural Marxist revolution that has stigmatized Western history as racist and White supremacist while elevating Africa as the cradle of civilization. We look at the lethal weakness of European altruism that is ultimately welcoming the takeover of its lands by foreign invaders while programming its own citizens to take blame for the faults of the world at large. 

In the members’ section, we consider why only European Nations are being targeted to absorb the colossal outflow of migrants from the Middle East and Africa. Dan underscores the media’s role in shaping the cultural and moral framework of European peoples in a way that vilifies and undermines their legacy and best interests. Further, we look at the vindictive actions of South African journalists that perpetually cast a negative light on the Afrikaner population. Later, we get into the misgivings of technological advancement – the flip side being a sad decline in the ability and common sense of modern consumers. Dan talks about the reality of Afrocentrism imposed upon Whites in South Africa and mimicked in Hollywood. We end with ideas for creating a true counter culture of people who are interested in the preservation and survival of traditional European values.

Title: David Yorkshire - Mjolnir: Art of the Right - Hour 1
Date: 2015-09-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=FQSs_GSkV3Q
Description: David Yorkshire is the pen name of an academic and teacher who has lived and worked in several European countries. He is also a published poet and is the editor of Mjolnir Magazine, a print magazine he created to showcase the Eurocentric illiberal arts. David joins us to share his views regarding the state of art in modern society and his vision for Mjolnir and Western culture. He begins by outlining the path that led him to abandon politics and work towards a revival of vibrant, traditional European creativity in response to the leftist propaganda permeating the arts. We discuss deconstruction theory and how the mentally perverted ruling elite have sponsored several generations’ worth of contemporary anti-art. David describes what he calls a "revolutionary traditionalist" ideology, and he reasons where conservatives, progressives and liberal leftists have danced around their radical ideals to the point of stamping out the primal instinct to preserve, protect and procure indigenous Eurocentric values. David also offers some criticisms of British Nationalist organizations and their methods of activism, and he gives suggestions for changing the social discourse through making art and engaging people in traditional, parallel structures. In the members’ segment, we consider the innate desire to admire traditional, classical and beautiful art and the small minority that finds the leftist garbage art appealing. David talks about the elitist nature of truly great art, where extraordinary excellence offers the average human a pinnacle of achievement to strive towards. We look at the pervasiveness of European creative intelligence throughout history and the contradictory Eurocentric view that all of humanity values intelligence equally. We reflect on the disappearance of hero worship in today’s cultural reference frame, abandoned for the celebration of the victim and underdog. David emphasizes the need for embracing the spirit of our ancestors, who achieved great mental strength through honing artistic skills. Then, we debate the importance of aesthetics in defeating the nihilist war on national identity. Later, David speaks to the importance of mainstream film in molding the masses, subversive Semitic messages in the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogies, and the rise of radical leftist comedy in the 1970s.

Title: Nikki Jago - Western Woman Problems
Date: 2015-09-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=4T5WhIdoJ3A
Description: Nikki joins us for a conversation about White women and motherhood. She begins by sharing the story of her experience dealing with a pediatrician who was pushing the noxious Similac formula for her infant, and what happened when Nikki decided to take charge of her daughter’s health by making her own baby food. We discuss natural remedies for common health problems and the benefits of preserving the primordial family structure. We also consider the importance of teaching our children about their heritage, and how to get around the anti-White propaganda that is pushed in the media and public schools. Nikki talks about her awakening to the war on European people, along with the politically correct cultural Marxist programming that is driving women away from fulfilling their natural motherly instincts. We reflect on the perverted imagery of pagan women and European sisterhood, and Nikki describes how she has managed to maintain a tightknit bond amongst her sisters and women folk. We end with thoughts on upholding harmony and balance in patriarchal and matriarchal relationships, and what it takes for families to achieve optimal physical, mental and spiritual health.

Title: Karin Smith - The Real Story of South Africa
Date: 2015-09-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=W6ZtJjWUEd0
Description: Karin Ann Smith is an expat South African living in Texas. She studied Nursing at Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg and worked in the Casino industry and for the biggest supermarket chain in South Africa, both upper management positions dealing with the Unions. She has been an activist calling for world attention to the genocide of the Boer people in South Africa for at least 10 years. Her family fled the civil war in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and eventually settled as farmers in South Africa, where her family of 5 siblings and both parents have suffered attacks by AK47 wielding gangs twice in the last 3 years, resulting in the death of her father last September. Karin talks about the history of South Africa during the days of the Dutch East India Company when the Cape of Good Hope was developed. She explains the early clash of the nomadic Boors and the African Zulu Nation along with the British colonization of the mineral rich region. We discuss the 1948 establishment of the Republic of South Africa by the National party, when apartheid laws were instituted as a way to maintain the peace between the minority White Afrikaners, the ruling Boers and warring indigenous Black tribes. Karin explains the political interests of the African National Congress (ANC) and underscores the track records of its communist faction, Joe Slovo, and the founder of the Armed Wing, Nelson Mandela. She also gives details related to the slow decline and decimation of the once predominately White South Africa, where taxpayer dollars cannot support the globalist takeover of a country lacking viable commerce from its majority population. Karin highlights some of the post-apartheid sanctions instituted by the ANC, along with the bigger picture of hatred towards Whites that has been stirred up by the ANC and their allies, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by Julius Malema. We consider the unique situation of present-day South Africa, where the reality of its brutally anti-White environment is strangely left out of any mainstream global report. We discuss the dire circumstances of Afrikaner squatter camps and government edicts that keep White citizens jobless, uneducated, and under the constant threat of illness and violent crimes against them.

Title: Matthew Heimbach - Towson White Student Union & Traditionalist Youth Network - Hour 1
Date: 2015-09-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=UZgGbZd4BU0
Description: Matthew Heimbach is a Towson University graduate with a Bachelors degree in History. He was the chapter leader of Youth for Western Civilization at Towson University, which was forcibly shut down by the school administration. Matthew and his members created the Towson White Student Union (WSU), a group dedicated to advancing the cultural, political and social interests of European-American students. After finishing college, Matthew and the Towson WSU joined forces with other dedicated White activists to create the Traditionalist Youth Network (TYN), a group dedicated to defending faith, family and folk on high school and college campuses around America. Matt talks about the different engagements he organized on campus to bring forth a new awareness of White student interests and to underscore the tremendous double standards that exist surrounding ethnic advocacy groups in formidably left-leaning educational institutions. Then, Matt explains his inspiration to take a stand for White interests and organize a healthy, organic movement in the spirit of celebrating the traditions and ancestry of his folk. Matt describes his ideas concerning a Southern American secession, and we look at the US’s founding Judaeo-masonic alliance. We analyze the attacks on Southern heritage following the recent Charleston shooting tragedy, along with the US’s demographical shift to swelling immigrant populations with little regard for national pride and legacy. In the members’ segment, we look ahead to the future of America in light of the radical political overhaul of the past 25 years that has quickly advanced the country towards a degradation of both infrastructure and quality of life. We also get into the media’s disingenuous reporting of crimes against Whites, with slanderous stories cherry-picked to further fuel the hatred towards pro-White communities. Matt shares some of the objectives of the TYN, all of which are aimed at a total reorientation of energy/resources away from the senseless global conglomerate and towards a more instinctual family/community tribe lifestyle that is focused in preserving natural order.

Title: Dr. Sherri Tenpenny - Why You Should Say NO to Vaccines - Hour 1
Date: 2015-09-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=TzzMHfjMpgk
Description: Dr. Sherri J. Tenpenny is an osteopathic medical doctor, board certified in three medical specialties. From 1986 to 1998, she was a full time Emergency Medicine physician and the director of the Emergency Department in Findlay, Ohio. In 1996, she opened a center for Integrative medicine and patients have come from nearly all 50 states and 14 countries to get well using a combination of conventional and holistic therapies. Dr. Tenpenny joins us to talk about her important research related to problems with vaccines and the work she is doing to speak out against these damaging inoculations. Sherri covers the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) faulty science and the vaccine industry’s incorrect premises - outlining some not-so-secret studies that clearly show people should be less alarmed about contracting viruses and more concerned with being poisoned by toxic chemicals coming through the needle. We discuss the ramped-up vaccine schedule started in 1991, when 49 doses of 16 vaccines with 65 different toxic chemicals became the normal routine for children beginning at infancy. We look at the hysteria and hype over virus outbreak “epidemics” that have brought forth the legislation of some very steep mandatory vaccination policies infused with politics and big money. We also get into the battle over California’s SB277 forced vaccination law and its slated referendum. In the second segment, Dr. Tenpenny explains the Healthy People 2020 agenda and the 2010 declaration by the World Health Organization that this is the “decade of vaccines.” We consider the trillion dollar pharmaceutical industry, Obamacare, the implementation of forced medical records, and the coopted, corrupt physicians that play the leading role in a well-articulated plan to keep citizens sick and locked into the crooked medical system. Sherri speaks to the multigenerational indoctrination that holds people at the mercy of “authority” figures for their health care needs and afraid to inquire about treatments that are literally altering human DNA.

Title: Dr. David Duke - A New Paradigm For True Human Diversity and Freedom
Date: 2015-09-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3dUQpT5fpv0
Description: Dr. David Duke is a graduate of Louisiana State University with a BA in History. He pursued a PhD in the largest university in Ukraine and in 2005 completed his Doctoral Defense in Kiev. He is a former member of the House of Representatives from Louisiana. His books “Jewish Supremacism” and “My Awakening” are translated into numerous languages, with millions of copies in circulation. Duke is with us to share his views on the right of every people on earth to preserve their heritage, genetic lineage, cultural traditions and freedom. Dr. Duke views Zionist-driven globalism and its collaborators the greatest enemies of mankind, and his ideas bring forth a way of liberation for all people by promoting a new paradigm for true human diversity and freedom. We discuss psychological conditionings and associations that Europeans are the enemies of mankind, and David describes how we can raze the system of Jewish supremacy that keeps this propaganda in circulation. We talk about the Jewish-controlled media’s role in changing the value systems of the Western world, teaching destructive behavior, over-sexualization, and the dismantling of the nuclear family. David points to the depth of Zionist political corruption in our government, and he asserts that the only way to free ourselves from this occupying force is to instruct our people of this mortal enemy. We get into Christian Zionism, civil liberties, and the importance of White people connecting with their ancestry to understand the tremendous accomplishments that were achieved in establishing the great European nations that exist today. David says that our survival is hinged on elevating and supporting women, and that men must make revolutions within themselves in order to rise up to their fullest potential and attract viable mates. Then, we look at the ever-popular meme of ‘White supremacy’ that is used to attack White human rights activists, along with the fact that it is the inborn urge of every people to express their essence in their own forms of art, music, culture, religion, societal structure and government. He underscores the source of the ultimate racist supremacy on Earth, and he suggests that by regaining control of the media, European values can be restored and peace will ensue. At the end, we touch on ways to use simple psychology to open the minds of people to understanding the true nature of human diversity.

Title: Darrel Hamamoto - Technocratic Takeover: PC Universities, Mandatory Vaccines & Erasing Instinct
Date: 2015-09-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=HWaTQiJMATw
Description: Darrell Y. Hamamoto is a professor of Asian American Studies at the University of California, Davis. He is the author of a handbook directed to college and university-age youth disillusioned with academic orthdoxy and political correctness titled “New World Order Theory For Students.” Darrell describes the politically oppressive environment at UC Davis where, like most institutions of education, cultural Marxism in all of its politically correct forms is relentlessly promoted to students. He talks about how a particular Asian American servitor of empire achieved the ushering through of California’s senate bill 277, removing personal exemptions for vaccine requirements of children. Darrell relates how this type of policy making extends to immigration concepts and rulings that are designed as means for the NWO to gain technocratic control of US citizens by blending out sovereignty. Then, we discuss issues related to Japan’s shifting demographics, including the feminization of men and the affinity for artificial intelligence and robotics that came as a response to the country’s lack in reproduction. In the members’ segment, we bounce back to the subject California’s mandatory vaccination bill and the rising opposition that is exposing the mad vaccine regime and faulty science, resulting in a major threat to the tyrannical medical system. Then, we get into artificial intelligence and robotics technologies that are being used for social control experimentation on children via seemingly innocuous toys called ‘relational artifacts.’ Later, we take a look at the inundation of pornography and oversexualized propaganda currently flooding the internet, including the newly popular ‘Hijab porn.’ Hamamoto postulates that the virtual porn trend is a gateway for the rollout of ‘pleasure robots’ as well as the removal of traditional sensuality and sexuality, which he says is part of a larger process of draining out the instinctual drive of men to defend territory and achieve success.

Title: Angelo John Gage - The Marxist Matrix - Hour 1
Date: 2015-08-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MDiBzzcPgYE
Description: Angelo John Gage is a political activist who is fighting against Marxism in all its abominable forms. A former US Marine, Gage went on to graduate from the International Center for Positive Change and Hypnosis as a NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) Master Practitioner and Conversational Hypnotist. He also chairs the National Youth Front (NYF), an anti-supremacist conservation organization dedicated to the preservation of all White people, including their nations and cultures across the globe. Angelo is with us today to share an update on some of the recent activism and events the NYF has been involved with in bringing attention to the blatant anti-White agenda. We discuss the mind control techniques and public shaming campaigns that are commonly waged by the Zionist press and media against people who bring attention to the anti-White programming of the Marxist matrix. Angelo emphasizes how in a matter of a couple generations the universities have changed their tune to a stanch chorus of White demonization - from rewriting the history of colonial times to the organization of ‘privilege’ boards - the whole system is saturated with White guilt indoctrination. Angelo describes what happened to him when a recent NYF campaign, Operation Grumpy Grundy, resulted in his expulsion from Boston University - all for standing up against the anti-White bigotry of a professor who openly accuses White college males of being a ‘problem population.’ In the members’ hour, we look at how the modern matrix has created a generation of degenerates. Angelo outlines indications that a counter revolution is on the upswing because people are rapidly waking up to the spiritual war that is reaping havoc on Western culture and identity. We talk about the forced constructs of multiculturalism and tolerance and we explore the idea that every race and religion should have their own homeland. We also get into the ridiculous social justice warrior infighting and bickering that is killing identities across the board and creating a society in constant fear of being ostracized. At the end, Angelo gives examples of NYF’s pursuit of practical politics that is geared towards countering the attack on the true history of the American people and exposing the original Masonic conspiracy to create a continent of money hungry slaves blinded by materialism and ‘diversity.’

Title: William Flowers - Marxist Reconstruction of the South
Date: 2015-08-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NgI88TW03ng
Description: William Flowers is the Chairman of the Georgia League of the South. He is a political activist, an advocate of secession, a speaker, a writer and creator of the blog: ‘Arise Our Nation - Southern Nationalism and the Southern Folk Above All Else.’ Mr. Flowers joins us to share the mission and values of the League of the South. He explains the merits of a Southern secession and relates how the South’s shifting demographics and culturally competitive climate has transformed this once homogenous and politically autonomous region. William points to the reckless individualism of our consumerist culture that is driving the South and the rest of the US down the road of cultural genocide. He talks about the attack on traditional White southern folk being played out in academia and in the media, which is fueling a growing need and desire for a mass political ideological movement with an organic southern folk consciousness. We also touch on the nonsense of White privilege, our entitlement society, and the recent Confederate flag calamity. Then, William emphasizes why the term ‘cultural Marxism’ encompasses and defines all enemies of White European descendants. To round things off, we delve into ways to effectively organize and look at the basic tools for breaking free from the subversive programming that has derailed a healthy sense of ethnocentrism.

Title: Eric Hunt - The Shoah: The Biggest Hoax of the 20th Century? - Hour 1
Date: 2015-08-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=p4BH_704Zrw
Description: Eric Hunt is a filmmaker whose documentaries include “The Last Days of the Big Lie,” “The Treblinka Archaeology Hoax,” and “The Majdanek Gas Chamber Myth.” Hunt is with us to talk about the important research and work he has contributed in exposing the “greatest hoax of human history.” He has not only examined the “testimonies” and “evidence” of the so-called extermination program of the National Socialists in Germany during the 1930s/40s, but has also studied the propaganda that has been released to perpetuate this story. Eric talks about the ever-changing death toll numbers at Treblinka and Majdanek, and he points to other serious holes in the official narrative where gas chambers disguised as shower rooms are credited for the homicide of millions. We get into the specifics of disinfection facilities that were using Zyklon B to deal with the deadly typhoid epidemic that was sweeping through war-torn Europe, and evidence that suggests Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibór were not extermination camps, but rather work camps and transfer stations created to generate manpower and deal with the disease and violence of wartime. In the members’ hour, Eric touches on the methodology of wartime propaganda and the media monopoly that has existed since pre-WWI. We explore the horrific emotional garbage that is fed through the mainstream to perpetuate rumors of human lampshades and soap, fire pits of babies, and a Hitler that wanted a world of blue-eyed and blond-haired slaves, among other ridiculous atrocities. Later, Eric details his film, “The Treblinka Archaeology Hoax,” which debunks the British Zionist archaeologist Caroline Sturdy Colls’ fraudulent “investigation” of Treblinka. We end with a look at more of the indoctrinated guilt related to past deeds of Europeans that continues to be exploited for the reinforcement of new wars waged on behalf of Israel.

Title: Connor Boyack - The Clash Between Voluntaryism, Leftism & Multiculturalism
Date: 2015-08-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=b6QBOMFV72M
Description: Connor Boyack is the founder and president of Libertas Institute, a free market think tank in Utah. He is the author of several books, including the popular "Tuttle Twins" series for children, teaching kids age 5-10 about the principles of liberty. Boyack’s most recent book, “Feardom,” is an exposé of how politicians use fearmongering to acquire more power. In this “free market flashback,” Connor characterizes his perspective on the leftist tyranny that has infiltrated the US via the federal government, the public education system, and the mainstream media. He explains his political philosophy and vision, which he refers to as “voluntaryism,” where a civil society is governed by cooperation and voluntary participation in contractual agreements. We discuss the ideas of collectivism, public property, and rights of regulation in relation to current crude policies that have been created by an elite few to implement majority control over immigration, welfare, and egalitarian disputes. Then, Connor places the history of Mormonism into the context of the recent marriage hoopla that has cast a curious rainbow light on the US’s otherwise centralized thuggery of a government. We consider the original purpose of the Constitution of the US and the complete abandonment of consensual ratification that has the country in a state of arrested development. Later, Connor gives an overview of his book, “Feardom,” underscoring how politicians use fear as a weapon through calculated and statistically driven efforts designed to change societal behaviors. To round things off, we dig into governmental debacles such as race relations policies, the war on drugs, the criminal justice system, and taxes.

Title: Stephen A. McNallen - Asatru Hof: A Temple for the Norse Gods and Goddesses - Hour 1
Date: 2015-08-18
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=9y1o_6bhw3s
Description: Stephen A. McNallen has been a soldier, a journalist, a juvenile corrections officer, and a schoolteacher. In 1971, McNallen founded the Viking Brotherhood, the first legally recognized religious organization dedicated to the Gods and Goddesses of Northern Europe. Today, he is the head of the Asatru Folk Assembly (AFA), the preeminent Asatru organization on the North American continent. He is also the author of “Asatru: A Native European Spirituality.” Stephen is with us to talk about the AFA’s recent property acquisition in Brownsville, California – a site that will be used as a hof – a place to conduct rights and rituals and religious functions, along with serving as an Asatru community center and multipurpose space. He describes the lay of the land and the design of the existing grange hall that is now named “Newgrange Hall,” and also highlights improvements and embellishments that will embody an expression of the native, pre-Christian spirituality of Europe. We discuss how spiritual connectivity to ancient traditions has been largely abandoned in our modern materialistic world, and Stephen speaks to the symbolic timing of establishing this very emblematic sacred space that will serve to reawaken the primordial traditions and energy of the Germanic peoples. In the members’ segment, we talk about the Christian revolt against the old ways that resulted in the burning of many Germanic temples like the one in “Uppsala” (Ubsola), Sweden, and then we consider the archetypal embeddedness of ritual buildings that exists for most folk. We also reflect on significant aspects of spiritual bonds and mystical powers of the lands that AFA seeks to reenchant. Stephen explains the main purposes and philosophies of the AFA, underscoring the Asatruar values of autonomy and freedom from the control mechanism of nation states. In conclusion, Stephen addresses his involvement in counteracting poaching in Africa, and we also ponder what it takes to remain willing to resist the norms of our technocrat-ruled pop culture.

Date: 2015-08-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=iBdkOpFb0ZE
Description: Richard Spencer is President of The National Policy Institute (NPI) and Editor of Washington Summit Publishers, Radix Journal, and RadixJournal.com. He attended University of Virginia and University of Chicago and was a doctoral student at Duke University before dropping out to pursue a life of thought crime. Richard joins us for a discussion concerning the spirit of nationalism and the vision of NPI, an independent think-tank and publishing firm dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of European people in the United States and around the world. We begin with a look at America’s different forms of libertarianism and classical European liberalism, along with the varied political identity structures spanning the left and center to the far right. Richard talks about the twisting route he took to get to a nationalist point of view, and relates how the nihilistic heart of America is ready for something beyond the capitalist puzzle of consumerism and monoculture eating away at its family values and spiritual connections. We also get into the specifics of what defines the conservatives and the neocons, and Richard puts the whole “cuckservative” phenomenon into perspective. Then, we talk about the collective rise of the social justice warrior and White guilt complex that has worked together in creating and an evil image of European consciousness. At the end, we consider the benefits of tension between traditionalism and a Faustian spirit and Richard gives details about the upcoming NPI conference, “Become Who We Are,” slated for October 2015 in Washington DC.

Title: Jez Turner - British Isles Invasion, EU Border Collapse & Shomrim - Hour 1
Date: 2015-08-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=d8wg67DaYZ4
Description: Jez Turner is a British Nationalist who studied at the London School of Economics. He is a Pashtun speaker who served as an Officer in the Royal Signal Corps. He is the creator and Chairman of the London Forum. Mr. Turner joins us for a conversation about the immigration invasion that has Europe at the tipping point. We begin by touching on the serious situation in Calais, France, where a Eurotunnel terminal has been essentially hijacked and is allowing thousands of asylum seekers from Northern Africa and the Middle East to invade Britain. Jez explains the Schengen Agreement, an EU policy that was designed to relax borders within the EU for greater ease of travel, and has promoted a neutered military unable to perform its duties. Then, Jez talks about the path that led him to organizing the London Forum, a non-party aligned conference group for nationalists from all walks of the right that is niche for creating idealists and activists. We seek the metapolitical answer to the question of what is happening to the White race of Europe concerning its ability to rise up and speak proudly and powerfully in favor of its own culture and lands. Our talk leads us to examine the slow and paralyzing ethnic death that is gutting the soul of the West through a misguided, and oftentimes missing, understanding of natural law. In the members’ segment, Jez clarifies the controversial Shomrim, a private Jewish police force that is beginning to ruffle London’s feathers. He describes the static demonstrations organized in protest of this privileged organization, which have turned “equal rights” into a joke. Later, we bring to light the idea of a nation as the point of origin of a racial/ethnic group, not a society resulting from its government.

Title: Veronica Clark - The Gleiwitz Incident: Nazi False Flag or Media Hoax? - Hour 1
Date: 2015-08-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=QrddwKpxO84
Description: Veronica K. Clark specializes in World War II and military history. She earned her bachelor's degree in Liberal Studies in 2005 and her master's degree in Military History in 2009. Veronica founded Vera Icona Publishers in 2011, now called Wilk Mocy Publishers. Ms. Clark is the author of many books, and she returns to the program for a follow up on her latest volume, “The Gleiwitz Incident: Nazi False Flag or Media Hoax?” In the first segment, Veronica talks about the background of the strained relationship between Germany and Poland that began in the 1600s. She tells of the deep wounds of the German psyche that were inflicted from years of conflict over lands and money that set the stage for animosity towards the Poles. She explains the incident at Gleiwitz where, according to the official narrative, the Nazis posing as Poles staged an attack near Germany’s border, which ended up being the pretext for launching off the murderous abomination of WWII. We also talk about Britain’s meddling and sabotaging in the north that made it impossible for the region to be at peace. In the members’ segment, Veronica discusses the reasoning behind Adolf Hitler’s invasion of Poland. She says that he was pursuing an alliance with Poland, but that he did have an imperial intent for unifying Northern Europe in the spirit of authoritarian Germanic rulership in order to create a powerful front against Russia. Veronica tells us about Hitler’s unique vision for the future of Europe, and his ultimate selling out of the eastern European people that was sealed when he enlisted the Nazi-Soviet pact. Then, we talk about Hitler’s views about the cultural superiority of the European race and we compare this to the concepts of American exceptionalism and “white supremacy.” Later, Veronica talks about the Zionist anti-western agenda to supplant power that is putting Confederate symbols and history under attack in America and desecrating the lifeblood of the West. We take a look at what ties the cult of Freemasonry with Judaism, along with the blatant masonic messages that are constantly intertwined within pop culture. At the end, Ms. Clark considers the genetic and biological components of strong leadership and the Nordic element of European power.

Title: Dawn Stefanowicz - The Impact of LGBT Parenting & Children’s Well-Being
Date: 2015-08-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MNsIRDFJWC0
Description: Dawn Stefanowicz is an internationally recognized speaker, author and media spokesperson. On her website she has provided news articles and research since 2006, and is a full-time licensed accountant (CPA). Through her book, “Out From Under: The Impact of Homosexual Parenting,” Dawn acknowledges that children are impacted long-term by various family structures and living arrangements. She addresses legislation affecting children and advocates for children and families. Dawn begins by sharing her experiences in being raised by a homosexual father, where she was exposed to confusing, inappropriate and abusive sexual examples in the home from the time of infancy. She talks about some of the alarming evidence that shows how same sex parenting is detrimental to the health and wellbeing of the children involved in these relationships, which goes against the commonly accepted narrative from the left that this is not the case. She also stresses that redefining marriage is just the beginning of a growing movement to normalize all forms of sexual practices. We look at how this forced acceptance of genderless relationships breaks apart the fundamental basis of procreation and parenting, and when children are involved, whether through natural conception or IVF technology, there is a painful loss of identity created by having one gender rejected. Further, Dawn emphasizes where the LGBT movement has left out what children really need and gain from growing up with a primordial family unit. Then, she describes the political climate of Canada, where publically discussing issues related to same sex parenting or homosexuality can get one charged with a hate crime. In conclusion, we weigh up the ramifications of the state interfering with the moral values and education of our children and the rights of natural parents.

Title: Frank Salter - Eugenics, Ready or Not - Hour 1
Date: 2015-08-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=v_pirhrOwP4
Description: Frank Salter is an Australian academic and researcher at the former Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology. He is a political ethologist, studying political phenomena using the methods and theories of behavioral biology in addition to conventional methods. Frank’s recent essay, “Eugenics, Ready or Not” is the platform for our conversation, which begins with clarification of the definition and background of eugenics, along with its links to genetics and the rapidly advancing field of reproductive technology. Frank details some points in history that have given eugenics a bad name, underscoring instances where the state has stepped in and taken authority over individual sovereignty, an action he declares is extremely dangerous. We discuss where eugenics gets mixed up in the utopian dreams of the left, with social engineering schemes based largely on the denial of science and technology. Frank gives examples of positive, negative and coercive eugenics, and we look at the conditions that have created a consumer-driven eugenics industry via the expanding utilization of in vitro fertilization (IVF). In the member’s segment, Frank explains where the field of eugenics is receiving major influence from the cultural left, and we look at the myriad of moral, ethical and societal dilemmas that have sprung up because of the classic utopian socialist ideology that is being thrust forth into civilization by the social sciences and university system. He points to the war against Western society that is being waged through strong anti-white arguments involving the notion of breeding out ethnocentrism and the desire for self-preservation. We talk about the effects of the skewed drive for “diversity” across European and American lands, and we consider how the corroding weight of mass immigration could be clearing the way for a renewed interest in maintaining traditional rights. Frank highlights issues in the study of genetics involving gene editing that are posing dangerous implications for pushing biology out of the social sciences and humanities. To wrap things up, we size up the mad upsurge of asylum seekers looking to settle in the west along with the decline in native European populations and what this means for our genetic continuity.

Title: Tulaev Pavel Vladimirovich - Russian New Right, Slavic Paganism & Dual Faith
Date: 2015-08-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=JWlTv0-FkIA
Description: Dr. Tulaev Pavel is a scholar, writer, and professor of the International Slavic Institute in Moscow. He holds a Ph.D. in History and is the head of the Russian ATHENAEUM. Tulaev is a Russian nationalist who is on the forefront of the European New Right and Arian-Slavic movement, and the publisher of the magazines “Nasledije Predkov” (The Heritage of Ancestors) (1995-1999) and “Ateney” (2000-2010). He is the author and editor of many publications in different genres about Russia, Europe and America, including the book, “The White World in My Heart.” Professor Tulaev is with us to share his thoughts on the West’s fall into materialism and the idea that the Russian Nation is poised to save Europe and the entire White world from cultural and racial annihilation. He explains efforts that are being made to build a new continental axis between Paris, Berlin and Moscow in order to shape a reunification between Russia and the rest of Europe. We discuss how the US and Russia can work together to form a traditionalist and new right alternative movement. Then, Tulaev describes the concept of the ‘sobornost’ of human consciousness, a Slavic, pagan-rooted organic process of self-development and unity that is regaining popularity in Russia. We talk about the origins of the Slavic people, the Russian tsar dynasty’s role in establishing Russia, and various pagan traditions that were mixed together in a dual-faith assimilation of Christianity. Further, Dr. Tulaev highlights his work that addresses modern theologies that have come to replace the principles of ancient Slavic peoples. At the end, we consider the forgotten sacred gift of fertility and how low birth rates in the West represent a symptom of being cut off from knowledge of the natural order.

Title: George - The Truth About Golden Dawn & The Crisis in Greece - Hour 1
Date: 2015-08-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=jlt_fMrusdI
Description: Giorgos (George) is the editor for the website of the New York division of Golden Dawn. This chapter specializes in collecting food donations that are shipped to the Greek people who have been starving due to the crisis and political treason perpetrated by the government of Syriza. Golden Dawn New York also works to counter the lies and propaganda against Golden Dawn in the English speaking world. George is with us to talk about the current economic situation in Greece – where it all began with the “Junta” regime in the 1970s, and in what direction this deteriorated country is headed. He provides a detailed explanation of Golden Dawn, which he asserts is the only political party in Greece today that truly stands for the sovereignty, security, and dignity of the Greek people. We discuss some of the disinformation and confusing exaggerations that mainstream media loves to spread in order to create a distorted image of the party. Then, we address the latest memorandum issued by Syriza and how Greece has been systematically sold out by international bankers over the past 40 years. George explains how the Greek people are being driven to poverty and despair through austerity policies designed to bankrupt the country and decimate resources. In the members’ segment we tackle the ongoing refugee invasion into Greece that has transformed the country in a matter of decades. George illustrates how the Greek people are not buying into the EU’s current senseless immigration policies and that it appears the left’s insidious agenda is leading towards an imminent collapse of the Eurozone. We dig into the immense propaganda that has westerners duped into believing the multicultural experiment and the idea that somehow European countries don’t belong to its native peoples. At the end, we discuss the psychology of the left and the comfortable state of decadence that has many incapable of recognizing what is truly at stake for the West.

Title: Anatole Klyosov - The Out of Africa Myth
Date: 2015-08-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=f66h_2dRcWs
Description: Dr. Anatole A. Klyosov is a US scientist (since 1990) born in the Kaliningrad region of Russia (formerly East Germany) at the end of WWII. He is known for his work in physical chemistry, enzyme catalysis, biomedical sciences, industrial biochemistry, and DNA genealogy studies. In Russia, he held one of the top scientific recognitions, being awarded the USSR State Prize in Science and Technology. Anatole joins us to speak about his research related to debunking the flawed “Out of Africa” theory of human origin. First, he describes his journey as a young scientist in Russia who went on to work abroad as a Professor of Biochemistry at Harvard Medical School. Klyosov explains how he came to be the first person in the early 1980s in the USSR to use the global computer network that later became the Internet. Then, he details the “evidence” widely published in academic journals that led him to investigate the accepted theory of “Mitochondrial Eve.” He relates how this baseless explanation of Anglo European ancestry conveniently placed an apologetic lens on the chronicle of African exploitation and slavery. Anatole defines the multiregional theory of evolution, and distinguishes the two earliest principle races – black Africans and fair skinned Neanderthals. He gives an overview of how races originated, and clarifies how specific DNA mutations are presented and carried throughout many generations of descendants. We discuss the various established dogmas present in the modern study of linguistics and archaeology, and we look at some projections by population geneticists concerning the fate of human biodiversity. We round off the conversation by considering the effects of globalization on human evolution.

Title: Mike King - Planet Rothschild & The Lie of Democracy - Hour 1
Date: 2015-07-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=VvwQ18X4oMU
Description: Mike King is a private investigative journalist and researcher based in the New York City. A 1987 graduate of Rutgers University, King's subsequent 27 year career in Marketing & Advertising has equipped him with a unique perspective when it comes to understanding how "public opinion" is scientifically manufactured. Mike has recently released three new books: “Planet Rothschild,” “Mein Side of the Story” and “Killing America.” Our discussion begins with the family the mainstream media never mentions – the Rothschilds. Mike asserts that this powerful Jewish banking dynasty has been at the core of the 250-year-old NWO drama, with big government involved as their ultimate customer. We speculate how and why the big shots behind this demagoguery are rarely every touched by the media, and we also look at some major points in history that solidified in their advancement, including the defeat of the anti-usurer, Napoleon Bonaparte. Mike emphasizes the Marxist origins of democracy, explaining that it was created as a tool of subversion not included in the vision of the US’s founding fathers. We look at the connections from Rothschild interests to the formation of Israel, to globalist political players, and to the billionaire George Soros. Then, we talk about why Greece has been completely sold out by the left, and why Spain suddenly feels the need to apologize to the Jews for the 1492 Edict of Expulsion. In the members’ hour, we jump into the subject of the escalating war on Whites that is infiltrating Western civilization. We talk about the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) “fair housing” program that Obama is pushing on “too white” suburbs across the country. We speculate about Donald Trump’s bid for presidency in what appears to be another game of controlled opposition rigged to keep hostile anti-White elites in control of the battleship. Further, we get into the stripping away of America that is taking place at a startling rate, from the symbolic destruction of Confederate monuments and the banning of the Confederate flag to the rising threat of “microaggression” by evil White people. At the end, we discuss the disturbing exhibit honoring mass murderer Ghengis Kahn and “utterly groundbreaking” mainstream media programming aimed at denigrating Whites.

Title: Mikkel Clair Nissen - Collectivism: Denmark vs. America - Hour 1
Date: 2015-07-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=8MfR1lh8BjI
Description: Mikkel Clair Nissen is a Danish anti-collectivism activist and author of the book, “Manipulism and the Weapon of Guilt: Collectivism Exposed." The book exposes Denmark, the supposed happiest nation on earth, for what it truly is: collectivism's biggest propaganda hoax. Mikkel, who joins us following his recent parting from Europe, is now traveling around the US to promote his book and create a new life. Our discussion begins with a glimpse into the array of totalitarian ideologies that have crept into Scandinavia through the rulership of psychopathic narcissists. Mikkel explains how poor personal boundaries have formed the basis of this dysfunctional society, where people are caught up in a malignant state of degrading and policing each other, creating a vicious cycle of subjugation, of which the government takes great advantage. We discuss the serious illness of cultural Marxism in Western culture, which has created societies in a state of arrested development fueled by envy, egoism, and a lack of responsibility. We talk about the Fabian indoctrination of children through the education system and pop culture, where individuality is stripped away, resulting in more energy (tax) for the bourgeoning monoculture organism. In the members’ section, Mikkel shares his philosophy of individualism and highlights the five elements of leftism. We get into the government’s infringement on the right to homeschool children that seeks to further divide the family structure in the west, along with the left’s political strategy of billing traditional family values as a fascist dictatorship. Mikkel describes what it’s like living in the collectivized climate of Scandinavia, underscoring the phenomena of fear, guilt and refusal to accept failure that keeps people enslaved within inferiority complexes and broken social systems. The conversation gets interesting when we consider the eroding effect that mass immigration has on small, traditional European countries and the foundation of the American dream.

Title: Fernando Cortes - Can Americans and Mexicans Unite to Defeat a Common Enemy?
Date: 2015-07-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=rlINnX9O6qk
Description: Fernando Cortes is a Mexican national residing in Guadalajara, Mexico. He has been a self-proclaimed third position nationalist for over 15 years and has founded a handful of nationalist groups in Mexico that are geared towards guiding youth to becoming better citizens. Cortes was the MC at the recent International Identitarian Congress in Mexico. He is committed to helping establish international relationships among all identitarians, especially with his natural border, the United States. Fernando begins with a broad overview of the Mexican nationalist scene and how he came to identify with the movement. We discuss the economic climate of Mexico and Fernando gives an interesting explanation of the country’s historical relationship with the US, as well as the transformations and tensions that emerged along the road to Mexican independence. Fernando expands upon the mix of economic discrepancies amongst Mexican land owners and the power struggles with Spanish-descended elites that led to the Mexican-American war and resulted in a huge loss of Mexican territory. We then fast forward to the current situation of Mexican immigration to the US. We shed some light on how this upheaval of both populations is only aggravating the oppression created by transnational companies in control of natural resources. Fernando emphasizes how the Zionist/neocon model rests upon the economic bubble of US capitalism, and we consider where racial tension fits into keeping up this scam. Further, we scrutinize the common cultural Marxist parasite that is eroding away at the identities and values of European and Mexican descended Americans alike. At the end, Fernando explains where the traditional Mexican mentality vastly differs from the mainstream, politically correct American mindset, and we explore how White and Mexican identitarians can establish a healthy middle ground to conquer our shared oppressors.

Title: Gwen Olsen - Confessions of an Rx Drug Pusher - Hour 1
Date: 2015-07-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Nm_zZcS2ZiY
Description: Gwen Olsen is the author of the award-winning book, "Confessions of an Rx Drug Pusher." A fifteen-year-veteran pharmaceutical rep, Gwen worked for McNeil Pharmaceutical, Syntex Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb and others. She was a hospital rep and specialist rep for the majority of her career, selling prescription drugs to doctors. Gwen joins us to share her unique industry insider’s perspective of the current US drug problem. She gives details about her awakening process that began with the realization that the information she was disseminating to doctors was extremely skewed, and later was ignited through a family member’s heartbreaking journey of becoming a mental health patient. She explains her role as a marketing tool for Pharma, where successful drug sales are calculated through doctor profiling and often encouraged with extravagant perks to prescribing physicians. We discuss the corruption and money making interests of the rapidly expanding 300 billion dollar global pharmaceutical market, and Gwen breaks down the greatly slanted process of FDA drug approval. We also consider the propensity for psychoactive drugs to exacerbate symptoms and the collective refusal by doctors to identify causal relationships with long-term use of these mind altering chemicals. In the member segment, we zoom out to the big picture of widespread pharmaceutical use amongst American consumers. We weigh up the superficially created problem of escalating mental illness and the social control mechanism of medicalizing normal emotional states. Gwen speaks to the role educators have assumed in encouraging parents to medicate their children, and the mandatory vaccinations that has taken hold in California. Later, we talk about the minimalized correlation of psychotropic drugs and mass shootings, along with telltale signs that some of these deranged killers are subjects of trauma-based mind control.

Title: Anthony McCarthy - Sex & Love: Moral Decay in a Narcissistic Society - Hour 1
Date: 2015-07-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0G8jt02URss
Description: Dr. Anthony McCarthy is the Education and Publications Manager for the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) and a Visiting Lecturer in Moral Philosophy at the International Theological Institute in Trumau, Austria. His philosophy thesis, "Ethical Sex: Sexual Choices and their Nature and Meaning - Perspectives from Natural Law and Marriage " is being prepared for publication as a book. Anthony is with us to help make some sense of the extreme views on sex and marriage that are currently permeating academia, the mainstream media, and politics. In the first segment, we take some time to consider the traditional form of sex in relation to love and lifelong commitments aimed at procreating for future successful generations. Anthony links the political motives of the Frankfurt School of philosophy and social theory to the transformation of sexual views and destabilization of family values we are seeing today. We discuss the atomization of the individual and stripping out of natural roles that has been achieved through the moral restructuring of popular culture by liberal social justice warriors. We also take into account totalitarian ideologies masked as freedom that are ultimately anti-human. In the member’s segment, we talk about the problem of low fertility rates in the west and what we can do on a cultural level to encourage and support more potential parents in committing to raising children. Dr. McCarthy points to our narcissistic society as the main reason men have become less manly and "sexually liberated" women no longer see the need to challenge men to step up to the plate and provide for a family. Then, Anthony speaks to the troublesome implications of gay parents demanding their right to have children, and what is implied by using IVF when there is no consideration for the child’s best interests and human life is reduced to a consumer product.

Title: Roger Devlin - Sexual Utopia in Power - Hour 1
Date: 2015-07-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=yBXDxb4Ib8M
Description: F. Roger Devlin, Ph.D. is an independent scholar. He is the author of "Alexandre Kojeve and the Outcome of Modem Thought" and many essays and reviews in such publications as The Occidental Quarterly, American Renaissance, Counter-Currents, VDare and others. Roger joins us for a discussion on the subject of his latest book, "Sexual Utopia in Power," which is based on a number of different essays he has written throughout the years. Roger begins by laying out some of the utopian ideas that were propagated by magazines like Playboy and Cosmopolitan and became the backdrop for the sexual revolution of the 1960s. We look back to the roaring 20s, when divorce became fashionable and traditional viewpoints on morals and marriage were slowly beginning to shift. Roger explains how the selling of women as a utopian vision of sexuality was done for money by some and as a conscious effort to undermine American society by other revolutionaries coming out of the Frankfurt school. We look at the structure of herds and mating patterns in nature, and the common misconceptions that the sexual liberation of women equals more sex for men. Devlin criticizes the mainstream conservative responses to the sexual revolution, which often point to predatory men taking advantage of innocent women. He emphasizes that women have indeed been targeted with the propaganda of unconstrained sexuality, placing them in the position to control the supply and demand of sex, and therefore responsible for changing their behavior in order for societal problems to improve. Further, Devlin argues that the feminist revolution is a byproduct of the prosperity and increase in leisure time women have enjoyed since the industrial revolution, not because of oppression or mistreatment by men. In the members’ section, we jump into the hoopla of the legalization of gay marriage, the consequences of same-sex parenting, and the assault on free speech and freedom of opinions. Then, we look at how the former system of a "family income" has been replaced with "equal pay for equal work" and the disintegration of the male provisioning instinct. Roger speaks to the importance of women marrying and having children early in life, and he ties women competing in the workplace to high divorce rates. We finish the conversation by touching on the instinctual female attraction to dominant men, along with the recent frenzy over portrayals of female masochism.

Title: Tim Murdock - Why Diversity is a Lie - Hour 1
Date: 2015-07-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ejIRvo44TRY
Description: Tim Murdock is the host of White Rabbit Radio and the voice of Horus the Avenger. He is behind the widely circulated memes, "Diversity is a code word for White genocide" and "Anti-racist is a code word for anti-White." He has also produced the popular animations "How Whites Took Over America," "Anti-Racist Hitler," and "Johnny Racist." Tim returns to Red Ice Radio for another look into the ridiculous double standards of diversity. He begins with a detailed definition of the broad term of "genocide" and links these points to explicitly stated agendas of certain power elites seeking to achieve the disappearance of specific ethnic groups and the eradication of particular ethnically pure states. We discuss the very public proclamations of EU officials that blatantly reveal the war being waged against Whites and ancient European cultures. Further, we consider how Zionists are using technology and psychological warfare to deliberately modify the behavior of Whites, and we look at the increased questioning of suspicious politics and open border policies that are alerting even the mainstream to the anti-White scheme. In the second half, we discuss the breakneck speed of the demographic restructuring taking place in the west and how this is ultimately bringing about the swift destruction of the mental wall that has kept many Whites from seeing the larger agenda of mass immigration. We look at the recent Charleston church massacre in relation to the collective tension resulting from the forced absorption of non-Whites into Western civilization. Tim underscores how the powers that be are being undermined by their own insane policies, which appear to be part of the execution phase of an aggressive and drastic plan to take ownership of everything on the planet. At the end, we reflect on the crazy practices of anti-White Whites and the identity politics that have predominately White countries in a state of arrested development.

Title: Mike Enoch & Seventh Son - The Right Stuff: The Daily Shoah - Hour 1
Date: 2015-07-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=HYBiDXBKJic
Description: Mike Enoch and Seventh Son are behind the websites The Right Stuff and Ovenworthy – both political and cultural blogs that are aimed at “reinvigorating dialogue among a disparate and edgy right-wing and inflaming anuses among the childish and regressive left-wing.” Their weekly podcast, The Daily Shoah, infuses edgy humor to touch on current events. Mike and Seventh Son join us to discuss the Cultural Marxist infiltration of libertarianism that has infected and possessed Western civilization. They speak about their separate journeys of becoming fed up with progressivism, and their decision to create a platform, stripped of the politically correct muzzle, to discuss the vast array of issues plaguing the political spectrum. We touch on the economics of fascism, the contradictions of corporatism and the free market, and the competition of rent seeking ethnicities. We look at the tangled web of the social services bureaucracy inviting parasitic intrusion across all Western borders, and the wide chasm of hate speech that makes is all but impossible to rationally discuss the problems tied to mass immigration. In the members’ hour, Mike and Seventh Son illustrate of some the heated "Ovenworthy" topics they have presented in order to instigate the tipping of sacred cows across the mainstream and alternative board. We consider conundrums surrounding voting, multiculturalism, racism, reproductive rates, White guilt, and other predicaments faced by Europe and the US. To round things off, we connect the dots from the forgotten history of Northern Europe to the madness in the Middle East and the collectivist behavior of White western culture that is allowing our motherland to be swallowed up by hostiles.

Title: Jack Sen - UKIP: Controlled Opposition?
Date: 2015-07-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=w-MxHTfNTAQ
Description: Jack Sen was a United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) prospective Member of Parliament for northern England before being unceremoniously, and quite publicly, suspended by his party one week prior to the General Election for attempting to broach the subjects of indigenous displacement in Britain, and raising the issue of the genocide waged against the Boer people in South Africa. Jack begins with a bit of history on how he became attracted to UKIP in the first place, and explains the series of events leading up to his suspension. He details the election process and distinguishes the challenges that are faced by a party that is fundamentally very anti-European Union, relating that the fear of an economic crash is driving many people to continue to vote for inclusion within the EU. We discuss the decidedly pro-immigration standpoint of UKIP, which appears to be geared towards subverting British nationalism and ultimately bringing Islam to its doorstep to encourage the destabilization of anything resembling traditional societal values. Jack talks about the Twitter storm that ensued after he tweeted a comment about where Labour MP Luciana Berger’s loyalties lie. He raises several issues that point to UKIP funding and influence by elites with different ethnic interests than that of the British people. We look at the money trail that has all but buried the idea of Britain as a sovereign nation acting in its own best interests. We also consider the fringe issues associated with LGBT politics that are tirelessly publicized in the mainstream, diverting attention away from critical matters such as unemployment, broken families, depression, violence, rape, and the endless flood of migrants that are taxing resources, creating a cultural cacophony, and rapidly corroding Britain’s unique ethos. At the end, we shine a light on the parasitic façade of multiculturalism that is preventing Western civilization from embracing and proudly preserving its indigenous culture.

Title: Curt Doolittle - Propertarianism & Philosophy of Truth Telling - Hour 1
Date: 2015-07-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=88F0kcJ4vsI
Description: Curt Doolittle is an American entrepreneur and author living in Kiev, Ukraine. He is an independent theorist of political economy in the conservative libertarian tradition, and founder of the Propertarian Institute. Curt is with us to share his work surrounding Propertarianism, which can be defined as the philosophy of truth telling and a response to conservatives’ lack of a rational and scientific language for discussing the evolutionary strategy of ancient Western civilization. Curt begins with an overview of the framework of Propertarianism and reasons why truth telling has historically given European society a competitive edge. He explains the differences between high-trust and deceit oriented cultures, distinguishing the costs of truth telling vs. lying. Then, we discuss the various reactionary movements that emerged from the failed Enlightenment project, each riddled with a desperate attempt to hold onto the past while utilizing inoperational sciences, resulting in over a century of costly pseudoscience. Curt emphasizes that Anglo Europeans operated for thousands of years in extremely high-trust societies, and this gave rise to a lack of healthy skepticism when confronted with a new age of mass media, propaganda, and deceit. He adds how franchising women into politics paired with an influx of immigrants from low-trust societies topped off with the idealism of political correctness all changed the moral landscape of the west. In the members’ segment, we talk about the problems of capitalism, the implementation of free speech rather than truthful speech, and the church of consumerism. Curt explains why democracy doesn’t work, how there is no need for the monopoly of the production of commons, and that government should have no business in making laws. We discuss the fragileness of the infrastructure in which we live, and that it no longer takes masses in the streets to bring about revolution – just a small number of intelligent people with a plan, moral authority, and something to demand. Later, we look at shifting IQs in organizing production, along with the costs of reproduction. In conclusion, we explore solutions to the post democratic polity, where the financial monopoly is destroyed and each region of the west is free to contribute to the market based on its own cultural preferences.

Title: Jay Dyer - Dylann Roof & The Charleston Church Shooting
Date: 2015-07-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5QPd37WGRec
Description: Jay Dyer is a writer and researcher from the Southern US who obtained his BA in philosophy, while his graduate work focused on the interplay of literary theory, espionage and philosophy. His website, Jay’s Analysis, is dedicated to investigating the deeper themes and messages found in our globalist pseudo culture, illustrating the connections between philosophy, metaphysics, secret societies, Hollywood, psychological warfare and comparative religion. Jay returns to RIR for a special extended segment in which we discuss the June 17, 2015 shooting at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, allegedly carried out by the now infamous Dylann “Storm” Roof. Jay provides his analysis of the patterns surrounding this event, which have curious similarities to those of other mass shooting sprees and false flags that have been highlighted in the mainstream media. We discuss many elements that point to stage craft, including the ready-made narrative for a “White Terrorist” rolled out into news coverage, a cartoonish manifesto appearing on cue, and gun control legislation waiting in the wings for approval. We also consider the phenomena of active shooter drill running concurrent with the shooting and telltale signs of crisis actors being used for on-camera interviews. Then, we take a look at the larger context of the “Summer of Rage” being touted by the leftist media and pushed internally by the Obama administration in an effort to ramp up the threat of racial war, switching from that of Islamic terrorism. Jay lays out some of the true history of the Confederacy and the Civil War and we talk about the attack on southern symbolism that is promoting the psychological warfare strategy of mindless collective guilt. Further, we get into the monopoly of victimhood, the dangers of mob mentality, and the eradication of anything holding a meaning that could be deemed offensive. Jay also points to liberal indictments that are targeting the millennials to rapidly transform traditional values and wholesome living and destroy reason and logic. Later, we discuss the implications of the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) simmering in the background while racially motivated groups profit off of the government’s strategy of tension. At the end, we examine why only certain criminals are lifted up in the media and how the centralized power structure uses dupes and entrapment to carry out a degenerate agenda.

Title: Insight - Capture the Flag: Rebels & Rainbows
Date: 2015-07-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=7qJ_830i1rE
Description: The White House turned into a rainbow as the Supreme Court declared same-sex marriage legal nationwide, bypassing state sovereignty. While the country is wooed with rainbow magic, have they now forgiven the government of their many trespasses? How concerned are they about human rights, while removing the Confederate flag in the south? Tearing down one symbol and lifting up another is not about tolerance and love, it's about hate. It's not about equality, it's about revenge. This is a campaign of hate, cloaked in rainbows.

Title: Justin Garcia - Loyalty, Tribe & Violence - Hour 1
Date: 2015-06-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=zVDTXYUqM4w
Description: Justin Garcia or "MC" (Master Chim), as he's called in his martial arts academies, is behind The Pressure Project podcast and The Jungle Gym martial arts academy. A graduate of the NYC public school system, he's evolved to despise a few things… gov't schooling, excuse making, and the defense of mediocrity amongst them. A married, homeschooling father of three sons and one daughter, Justin spends his time lifting weights, arguing with manginas, and embracing his ever-growing role in the creation of a new generation of warriors. Justin is with us to talk about what he calls the Loyalty Matrix, a system that he created in order to logically quantify and define what makes a group. We touch on the recent story of Rachel Dolezal pretending to be a black woman, and what this kind of behavior says about true identity, loyalty and roots. Then, Justin explains the three main components of the Loyalty Matrix – Ritual, Procreation and Survival. We discuss the control mechanism of reducing humanity to commonalities that prevents groups from honoring and promoting their customs and traditions. Further, we look at the victim mindset that keeps certain groups trapped in defining themselves based on the values of other groups, and we explore the question of why it is acceptable to celebrate some groups and not others, especially those of European heritage. In the second hour, Justin gets into the concept of tribe building based on the Loyalty Matrix model. He underlines the importance of embracing the universal familial roles that have already been established for us, along with cultivating individual strengths that will lead to synergistic relationships with others. We talk about the value in maintaining a fit body and a sharp mind, dealing with addiction problems, and acknowledging the fact that it is a disservice to defend mediocrity. Justin emphasizes the idea that nothing weak survives, and building a relationship with violence is necessary in preserving and protecting the natural order. He adds that defending one’s honor is an essential component of any successful tribe, which is a skill that can be refined through ritual based violence. Later, Justin shares his views on homeschooling and parents who hand their children over to government institutions to be educated. At the end, we consider some of the egalitarian programming that has resulted in the “leaves of society” generation.

Title: Matthew Tait - Towards a New Century of European Achievement - Hour 1
Date: 2015-06-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=pxuzGsMHnAM
Description: Matthew Tait joined the British National Party (BNP) at age 18 and founded a local party branch from scratch. He has stood for election at the local and national level on many occasions and faced persecution in the press and at work. Matt went on to found Western Spring, a fast growing 'post-Nationalist' community group who advocates innovative strategies to further the cause of Western Civilization and the European people. Matt is also the leader of Legion Martial Arts Club, which organizes camping events for younger people and aims to teach a variety of life skills. In this talk, Matt focuses on positive solutions and strategies where he is taking the lead and reaching out to all those who wish to play a meaningful and successful part in a new century of European achievement. Before this, he stresses the need to correctly diagnose the source of our malaise and provides reasons why none of us should give in to pessimism and hopelessness. We speak about the profit-driven corporate matrix we live in, where no system of control exists and machines are becoming more powerful than man. We also touch on the victim mentality that prevents ordinary people from doing anything really useful in society and the deliberate separation between Europeans and their history that prevents them from comprehending their sheer potential. Matt tells about some of the encounters with citizens in his community he experienced while campaigning for the BNP, relating how desperately people are craving new leadership and radical change towards a traditional culture. In the second half, Matt continues on the theme of the urgency for self-examination and greater personal dedication to the cause as well as taking more varied and intelligent approaches to overcoming our enemies. He speaks about his dream of writing a digestible form of the European story in order to bring alive the vision and message of nationalism in a simple, traditional and factual way. To conclude, we envision the steps to creating a stimulating, supportive, confident community that is accessible to like-minded people and those who are fed up with the current social justice warrior-ridden mess of liberal politics and ready to contribute to a promising movement.

Title: Kristiina Ojuland - EU to Force Mass Immigration on Estonia
Date: 2015-06-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=BeIpLLa0GYg
Description: Kristiina Ojuland studied law and politology at University of Tartu. She is the founder and leader of the People’s Unity Party 2014. Ms. Ojuland was once the Foreign Minister of Estonia, a member of Riigikogu (Estonian Parliament), and served on the European Parliament in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) group. Kristiina is with us to talk about the increasingly troublesome issue of mass immigration in Estonia and Europe in general. She sums up the demographic, economic and social climates of the small, relatively poor country of Estonia, where native populations are quickly being transformed by “refugee” transplants flooding in from North Africa and other Mediterranean countries. We discuss the special privileges and benefits that are granted to non-European immigrants and the major burdens the social system is experiencing through receiving foreigners who resist true integration and exploit the social order. Kristiina touches on the important point of security threats that are presented with mass quantities of Muslims entering Europe, many of whom are lacking passports, have questionable backgrounds, and are seeking new identities as ISIS fighters and Jihadist radicals. We expand on the crippling effects of political correctness in government and where this absurdity needs to be eliminated in order to speak frankly and honestly about immigration issues, namely the European Commission’s response to the recent boat crisis in the Mediterranean and their plan to impose non-voluntary immigration quotas across all EU countries. In conclusion, Kristiina talks about what she is doing to raise awareness about these extreme proposals and highlights steps that must be taken in order to preserve the continued existence of the unique cultures and peoples of Europe.

Title: Jonas De Geer - The Destruction of Western Culture - Hour 1
Date: 2015-06-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=FbX_U7Pdts0
Description: Jonas De Geer was born in Stockholm, Sweden in 1971. He's a writer, publisher, radio-personality and an activist. He has been a leading personality in the opposition in Sweden since the 90’s. Jonas is with us to help make some sense of what is happening with mass immigration to Northern Europe and the US and the policies that keep these throngs of people pouring over the borders. We discuss the unique altruistic attitudes based in freedom and democracy that are prevalent in these mainly White, Christian countries, and we question what has been reshaping public opinion about many hotly debated subjects such as gay marriage, divorce, the right to question history, and more. We point to evidence of a mainstream media agenda that is directing Western society to believe there is something wrong with wanting what is best for its own people, while an elite power structure benefits from the slow, steady erosion of American and European homelands and culture. In the second half, we look deeper into the issue of burgeoning immigrant populations in the west, where native peoples are steadily becoming minorities in their own lands and resources are quickly drying up while billions of dollars in aid are funneled to 3rd world countries. We also consider the one-dimensional qualities and controlled distribution of media coverage surrounding some of the most pressing issues facing Sweden. Further, we probe into some of the disturbing, imported problems that mass immigration creates, the bulk of which are being overlooked by the pathological mentality that resides within Sweden. At the end, we pick over the political arena in Sweden, where parties like the Swedish Democrats are revising their rules of inclusion and the controlled opposition helps to define the implementation of increasingly insane policies.

Title: Mark Hackard - Russia and the West: Cold War & Espionage History - Hour 1
Date: 2015-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2YGpazovFtY
Description: Mark Hackard is an independent foreign policy analyst. He earned a BA in Russian Language from Georgetown University and an MA in Russian, Eastern European and Eurasian Studies from Stanford University. He studies the intersection of political culture, religion and strategic issues, which he approaches from a traditionalist-conservative position. Mark joins us to speak about his work at the websites Soul of the East and Espionage History Archive. Our discussion begins with the subject of Russian intelligence history during the Cold War and going all the way back to The Great Game of the 19th century Napoleonic Wars. Mark gives an overview of the coveted resource rich heartland of Russia, a land mass that has been targeted for domination by Western financial oligarchs for millennia. We look at the geopolitical propaganda being churned out in Western culture through television programs like The Americans, where very convincing depictions of Soviet deep intelligence operations are featured. Mark draws attention to the fact that the producers of this programming have ties to the CIA, and we speculate on the meaning of some of the messages they are inserting. We consider the prevalence of communist totalitarian ideology driving politics during the first half of the 20th century that gradually led to the oligarchical power structure that is in place today. Then, we talk about the PSYOP weapons and mechanisms of control that are applied to our own populations in the form of pop culture, modern art, philosophical liberalism in education, and radical feminist, all used to destruct the organic state of human nature. In the members’ section, Mark gives details about KGB and Russian Special Forces units used to counter the foreign intelligence operations of the CIA and US Special Forces. Then, Mark talks about the cause of world communism that was forged by elite figures such as Kim Philby, a high ranking member of British Intelligence who worked as a double agent for the Soviets. We look to why this essentially religious devotion was pushed as a way to build a radiant future that would counter the cultural nihilism born out of the World Wars. We emphasize how this world state ideology sought to eliminate all nations and differences between peoples in the name of "peace," and where this is clearly being attempted today in an effort to remake mankind in the technocratic image of the oligarchs. At the end, we examine the degeneracy that has resulted from this leftist rooted struggle against god and its movement to remove any transcendent basis for human life.

Title: Johannus Boots & Amanda Newell - The Story of a Canadian Fine Artist vs. The Corporation of Canada
Date: 2015-06-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6ivIDjBjh40
Description: Johannus Boots is a fine artist who immigrated to Canada from Holland at the age of 10. His personal surrealist style reflects his love and respect for the abundant beauty of nature in all its perfection and intricacy. A portion of his more recent work may also depict some of the tenuous morality and contradictions of society. Johannus joins us with his partner Amanda Newell to share the story of a RIDE check traffic stop in 2013 that turned into a horrific, convoluted battle with Ontario Provincial Police and their judicial system. The two explain the peculiar manner in which they were stopped and approached by the police, the outright lies and coercion tactics that were used to brutishly wrangle Johannus into custody, and the despicable treatment he received while being processed through the system. Johannus and Amanda give details about their separate journeys of awakening to the deep corruption taking place under the registered crown corporation of Canada masked as its government, and they explain by what means their discoveries led them to major lifestyle changes. They relate how these life choices ultimately contributed to them being accused of association with the Freeman Society, resulting in a huge backlash of media attacks after the arrest, the defamation of Johannus’ career as a well-known artist, and the ruin of Amanda’s livelihood. Then, we discuss where Canada politics is heading with its new privacy act bill and recent involvement with the wars in Syria and Ukraine. We also touch on the odd trends of modern art, the indoctrination into the sham of a system that our educational system affords our youth, and the wonderful traditions and customs of our ancestors that are being diluted in the pot of monoculture.

Title: Sofia Smallstorm - Bruce Jenner's Trans-formation & Terasem Transreligion - Hour 1
Date: 2015-06-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2luMKw9QPvE
Description: Sofia Smallstorm is known for the documentaries 9/11 Mysteries and Unraveling Sandy Hook. Sofia is also recognized for her research on the connections between geoengineering and synthetic biology. Smallstorm joins us to share her insights on the recent media frenzy and praise surrounding the unveiling of "Caitlyn" Jenner. We discuss what we know of the former Olympian, Bruce Jenner, and the stages of treatments and procedures he has undergone to achieve the transformation. Sofia highlights some alarming evidence that shows there is a recent surge in feminized men seeking sexual reassignment. She explains how this ties into the script for social engineering and goes into the details of how chemicals laced with estrogen mimickers are effecting the development of men. We discuss the physical anomalies that are popping up at an alarming rate for men in our scented, disposable, shrink wrapped world, and we consider why there appears to be a hormonal war taking place in Western society. Sofia expounds upon the new type of sexual being that is being born out of the transgender movement. Then, we talk about the billions of dollars that is poured into futurist research by mega rich CEOs like Martine Rothblatt, who is part of a class of individuals that seeks to transcend the barriers of biology. In the member hour, we dig into the meat of transhumanism and the state of biological confusion that appears to be accelerating the crusade to destroy nature. Sofia illuminates the "Angelina Effect," where fear of cancer is being pushed onto women in the form of elective procedures that are billed as preventative measures to correct the errors of biology. Further, we consider the transreligion of Terasem and the ethnic interests this movement is promoting, along with the possibility that this dangerous ideology is pushing the human race towards a split and collapse. We also discuss the disappearance of the alpha male and how this fits into a designed shift towards energy based currency that will be fueled by harvesting human energy.

Title: Jim Fetzer & Ole Dammegard - Mass Illusions: The Moon Landing, The Holocaust & The Beatles & Doubles
Date: 2015-06-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Fx4dOViBqe0
Description: Jim Fetzer, a former Marine Corps officer, is McKnight Professor Emeritus at the University of Minnesota Duluth. He has published widely on the theoretical foundations of scientific knowledge, computer science, artificial intelligence, cognitive science and evolution and mentality. Ole Dammegård is an author, international speaker, investigator, former journalist, artist who is behind the website Light On Conspiracies. Ole and Jim join us to speak about their new book collaboration called, "And I suppose we didn't go to the Moon, either?" It is a collection of essays on government lies that is intended to challenge some of our most cherished and deeply held beliefs. Our conversation begins with the first subject of the book – the Apollo 11 Moon landing. Jim takes us through a few of the vast number of anomalies in the 5,000+ photographs in existence, and he talks about the problem with the Van Allen radiation belt, which continues to be a giant obstacle for space travel today. Ole gives his interpretation of why so many connections exist amongst various conspiracies within the government, and we discuss the backlash that is felt by researchers who decide to look into some of the most preposterous events in history. Then, we delve into the holocaust, anti-Semitism, hate speech, and the big media promotors of disinformation, as well as the deterioration of news coverage that is pushing the mainstream to alternative sources. In the members’ segment, we start with the fascinating tale of the Beatles and their golden boy, Paul McCartney. Jim relates how the British invasion of pop music in the US sparked a revival of spirit that was clung to by the grief-stricken youth who were reeling from the shocking assassination of JFK. We get into the details of the extreme operation that was used to replace the original Paul, who is said to have died in a car accident in 1966. Jim points to the numerous signs that suggest the Beatles placed clues about the death in their album artwork, lyrics, and even in the way they referred to Paul. Then, we look into the assassination of Saddam Hussein’s double and the real death of this beloved boogeyman. We also touch on the fakery surrounding Osama Bin Laden’s death and the disproportionately influential AIPAC lobby power that has been granted as a result of the sham. At the end, Jim gives us a rundown of the latest insane operation that has even the mainstream buzzing – Jade Helm. We chew over the different components of this military maneuver of which we can apply deductive reasoning, and we speculate on what could be in store for us if indeed we are on the road to Martial Law.

Title: Stephen A. McNallen - Asatru: A Native European Spirituality - Hour 1
Date: 2015-06-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=w2pHpUr9w7o
Description: Stephen A. McNallen has been a soldier, a journalist, a juvenile corrections officer, and a schoolteacher. In 1971, McNallen founded the Viking Brotherhood, the first legally recognized religious organization dedicated to the Gods and Goddesses of Northern Europe. Today, McNallen is the head of the Asatru Folk Assembly, the preeminent Asatru organization on the North American continent. Stephen joins us following the recent publication of his first book, "Asatru: A Native European Spirituality." He begins by clarifying some of the terminology often associated with indigenous northern European religions and traditions, and he gives an overview of the pre-Christian Germanic roots of Asatru along with its Celtic and Nordic connections. Stephen explains the attitude of Asatru beliefs, which above all consists of an ancestral faith practiced with a sense of freedom as noble men and women who do not need to be saved. He gives emphasis to the essence of connectedness – to our ancestors, our decedents yet to come, our living kin, the Gods and Goddesses, and the Earth and nature – ties that hold benefits and responsibilities. We discuss the savage Christianization of Germanic tribes that forced the abandonment of their natural spirituality and destroyed the importance of kinship bonds. Steve points to distinctions between the monotheistic father-God religions that view humans as slaves and property, and the polytheistic view of multiple Gods as kin and friends – Holy Powers that are part of one’s integral being. In the second segment, we consider how the Viking Sagas differ from the Christian bible, and Stephen describes where Asatru draws a sense of order and strength and addresses the fundamental questions of philosophy from a collection of values and virtues known as the 9 Noble Virtues and the 12 Traits. Then, we look at the themes of some of the central wisdom quest myths that teach the Odinic way of transcending and acquiring higher consciousness. We talk about the symbolism of performing rituals such as blót and drinking mead when recognizing the devotion, energy and insight received from the Gods and our ancestors. Later, Stephen gives a rough sketch of the pantheon of sky and Earth Gods recognized in Asatru and how their stories have been passed down in different ways throughout time. At the end, we reflect on the significance of the reemergence of Asatru during this time, an awakening that offers a healing and revival to the European people who have lost their sense of identity and wholeness.

Title: Greg Johnson - Exploiting Trust-Based Societies & Architects of White Genocide - Hour 1
Date: 2015-06-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=OMnCYgOHmpk
Description: Dr. Greg Johnson is the editor-in-Chief of Counter Currents and its journal and webzine North American New Right. He is the author of "Confessions of a Reluctant Hater" and also "New Right vs. Old Right." Greg joins us to share his insights on the current trend of pathological altruism that has taken hold of certain northern European countries, which is leading to a demographic destruction of native cultures through extreme immigration policies. Greg talks about his recent trip to Sweden, a country that appears to be all prosperity and Whiteness on the surface, but is truly suffering from very real problems created by an insulated elite political body with a fix-it-all attitude promoting mass immigration and radical diversity. Greg speaks about ice age hunter-gatherer descendants of northern Europe who built individualistic, trust-based societies, and he explains the different mentality that exists for ethnically defined tribal in-groups of the south and Middle East. He emphasizes how fundamental differences between in-groups is an invitation for exploitation and parasitic relationships. Then, we look at the widespread, misconceived attitudes today’s adults and parents have concerning passing on values to our youth, as well as the politically correct evolutionary rut that Whites have fallen into in the name of high-minded openness. In the members’ hour, we get into the religious aspect of unifying the ranks of the nationalist political movement and the need to disband the anti-White policies within Christian churches. We break down the construction of Christianity in Europe that brought with it the bloody destruction of native European spirituality and the tendency for pre-Christian religions and cultures to be regarded as an error. Greg underlines the net effects of being uprooted from ones traditions and superficially implanted within belief systems that lack identity. We also discuss the religion of liberalism, the (non)assimilation of immigrants, and the architects of White genocide. Later, we ask ourselves how we can get the conspiracy crowd to see the full measure of Israel’s masterpiece conspiracy. In conclusion, Greg defines the way to understand hegemony, namely harnessing the superior ability to adapt to changing circumstances.

Title: Survive the Jive - From Runes to Ruin Anglo Saxon Heathen Culture - Hour 1
Date: 2015-06-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=m9KN_K6AgTM
Description: Tom Rowsell is a writer, film maker and historian living in London, England. He holds a Master's degree in Medieval History and is a traditionalist with a perennial spiritual philosophy. Tom is with us to talk about his film, From Runes to Ruins, the first ever documentary about Anglo-Saxon paganism. To begin, Tom explains his motivation for creating a film that is meant to contribute to the identity and dignity of the people of today. We discuss the phenomenon of our disenchanted youth, many of whom amble on meaningless paths with no connections to ancestral roots or culture. Tom describes how his youth spent growing up in the countryside of England shaped his passion for preserving the history of the Anglo-Saxons who founded his country. We look at the nature-based, pre-Christian pagan traditions of Europe that could not be shed with its shift to the imported Christian theological perspective. Then, Tom speaks about various locations of rich history depicted in the film and he gives examples of the deep connectivity that existed between all of the European countries in pagan times. In the second segment, we consider the modern issue of lack of cognizance of history and identification with the land. Tom illustrates treasures of extraordinary artifacts from medieval times found in the area of Sutton Hoo that represent the true richness and advanced nature of the early Anglo-Saxon cultures. Later, we discuss the process of industrialization and the enclosure movement that has forced people off their lands and uprooted Western civilization. Tom talks about the inspiration of J.R.R. Tolkien that has helped to restore a sense of folklore to a world that is craving a shared appreciation of spirituality, simplicity and tradition. We emphasize the importance of learning about and respecting our ancestors in order to exist with dignity and value, and also how we can shine a light on the distorted history and compulsory shame that has been drilled into our heads through academia. At the end, Tom gives us a lesson on ancient sacrificial rituals that were practiced in order to show gratitude to the gods.

Title: Dr. Colin Ross - Psychological Trauma & Mind Control in the Intelligence Services - Hour 1
Date: 2015-06-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2ktZoYvNJzk
Description: Dr. Colin Ross is an internationally renowned clinician, researcher, author and lecturer in the field of dissociation and trauma-related disorders. He is the founder and President of the Colin A. Ross Institute for Psychological Trauma and has been running a hospital-based Trauma Program in Dallas, Texas since 1991. Dr. Ross has authored over 170 professional papers and several books, including "The C.I.A. Doctors: Human Rights Violations by American Psychiatrists" and "The Great Psychiatry Scam." Dr. Ross is with us to speak about his work in the fields of psychological trauma and CIA & military mind control. In the first hour, we learn about the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency and its first mind control venture, Operation Blue Bird, which is later rolled into MKUltra. Colin describes now declassified CIA documentation pertaining to the beginnings of MKU, detailing different overlapping foundations of the interrogation and brain washing world that are still being used to this day based on photographic evidence coming out of Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib. Colin explains how military and intelligence agencies select for susceptible individuals, commonly those who have already been traumatized, abused, or have multiple personalities. Dr. Ross talks about some of the strange connections to networks of professional psychiatrists, military doctors and MKU contractors he uncovered during his research. In the members hour, Colin gives an overview of the emergence of LSD from the CIA and military realm beginning in the 1950s, and he gives anecdotes of psychedelic experiments that were conducted in order to test mind control techniques. We move on through the areas of satanic ritual abuse and pedophilia in certain elite circles, as well as electromagnetic weaponry and transhumanism. Then, we touch on the use of general propaganda as a mechanism for control, sophisticated technology that is targeting unwitting consumers, and the resulting degradation of will that is infecting our societies on the whole. We wrap up the conversation with an evaluation of the pharmaceutical industry’s role in the field of psychiatry.

Title: Ole Dammegard - Making Critical Thinking Illegal: Questioning the Holocaust - Hour 1
Date: 2015-06-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=m75plUuKeWU
Description: Ole Dammegård is an author, international speaker, investigator, former journalist, artist and creator of the website Light On Conspiracies. He returns to Red Ice Radio for a special extended segment to speak about his research and thoughts on an extremely controversial subject, the Jewish holocaust. Ole has spent at least 25 years investigating a multitude of conspiracies, and this area of history involves such an incredibly sinister agenda that it is now illegal in some European countries to question the official story or even attempt to investigate the facts. We discuss the sad fact that in the west, where we have a strong tradition of philosophizing and discussion, this story involves so much horror, misery and bloodshed that most will not even dare entertain the notion of a massive cover-up at play. Ole stresses the importance of really looking at the 6 million number, a figure that has popped up repeatedly beginning in the late 19th century, and has been discounted just as many times. We consider the role of Hollywood in perpetuating the extremely emotional images of horrific crimes the Germans allegedly committed against the Jews, and we take into account the very inconsistent, baffling stories of evil that make absolutely no sense. Ole picks apart some of the gruesome details of the concentration camp gas chambers, where the monumental task of exterminating millions of people was purportedly carried out, and he details clear evidence that shows these accounts do not compute. Then, we take an even closer look at the programming we have been subjected to and the sheer magnitude of the lie, along with the anti-Semitic wall of defense that keeps people from unlearning and awakening to the Holocaust hoax. We also talk about the Soviets’ function in producing the death toll number and gas chamber narrative, players who were involved in the Yalta Conference held two months before the end of WWII, and the policy that was decided upon to be used against Germany. Later, we examine the ways in which the Jewish holocaust and other events like 9/11 and the Charlie Hebdo massacre have resulted in a war against critical thinking. We attempt to unravel Israel’s part in this dark agenda and why America is so wrapped up in the mayhem created by its foreign policy. At the end, we mull over the real reasons Germany had for mounting this horrible conflict and we take into account who has been pulling the strings behind the war machine.

Title: Gilad Atzmon - From A to Zion & The Jewish Solidarity Spin - Hour 1
Date: 2015-05-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=orCOKa9OuMg
Description: Gilad Atzmon is a British jazz artist and author born in Israel and trained in composition and jazz at the Rubin Academy of Music, Jerusalem. He is a member of the Blockheads, founded the Orient House Ensemble in London, and has recorded and performed with many rock music legends. Gilad also writes on political matters, social issues, Jewish identity and culture. Atzmon has written three books, and he returns to speak with us about his new publication, “A to Zion – The Definitive Israeli Lexicon,” a fictitious satire co-authored with cartoonist Enzo Apicella. Gilad gives a synopsis of the book and tells about his impetus for engaging the issues of Jewish ideology in Israel politics using aphorisms and humor. Gilad underscores some of the pressing themes he covers, most notably the solidarity movement that has destroyed the Palestinian people, as well as the political advancements that have been achieved through the military institution’s murderous wars against innocent civilians. Gilad emphasizes the bamboozling effects of identity politics among various discourses, and we relate this cultural tactic to the notion of the oppressed vs. the oppressor as a trick to lead victims into the hands of more oppression. In the second segment, Gilad illustrates the approach he created in “A to Zion” for explaining the control of language in Jewish identity politics. We look at the Jewish Palestinian Solidarity Movement’s Right of Return policy, which lies at the core of the Palestinian plight. We also examine some of the faulty terminology planted within various concepts in the movement that further misleads the discourse and legitimizes Israeli’s occupation of the West Bank. Gilad defines the roots of the Hebrew language, and we consider how terminology can be used to turn societies into dysfunctional multiplicities that are dictated by the need to be politically correct. At the end, we spend some time reflecting on the growing opposition to Zionism, the anti-Semitic crime of too much knowledge, and redefining the questions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in order to pursue the truth.

Title: Kevin MacDonald - Evolutionary & Genetic Basis for Pathological Altruism - Hour 1
Date: 2015-05-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-FyMrWbkL7Q
Description: Kevin MacDonald received his Ph.D. in Biobehavioral Sciences and is a retired Professor of Psychology. MacDonald is the author of several books, academic articles and reviews on evolutionary psychology and child development. His research has focused on developing evolutionary perspectives on culture, developmental psychology and personality theory, the origins and maintenance of monogamous marriage in Western Europe, and ethnic group evolutionary strategies. He is the founder of The Occidental Observer, an online publication. In the first hour, Kevin outlines his recent work, which explores theories of a genetic basis for altruism and the lack of ethnic awareness or kinship oriented nepotism. He explains recent scientific studies that are finding there is perhaps a genetic or evolutionary reason for the kind of pathological altruism found in Northern Europe. Kevin distinguishes the three different common sets of genes found throughout the north and south of Europe and the Middle East: hunter-gatherer, farmer and Indo-European. The main cultural distinctions here have to do with tribes that are banded together based on reputation, morality, competency and honesty, and groups that have strong hierarchical and kinship based societies centered on a military elite. Then, we consider the Western revolution of egalitarianism as being the direct result of a sort of moral indictment of the west, or a fundamentally morally defective image based on the engrained narrative of corruption, enslavement, genocide and anti-Semitism, thus resulting in the promotion of extreme movements for immigration and diversity. In the members’ segment, we discuss the European tendency to sacrifice itself for the benefit of others regardless of its dispossession. Further, we take a look at the leftist establishment in the academic world in conjunction with the media that tirelessly promotes a world of equal people deserving to be propped up on the same pedestal, while in the same token depicting White identity as stupid, immoral, and basically inferior. We wrap things up with an assessment of the present-day Western working class' voting patterns and attitudes about war, immigration and family values.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Michael Walsh - Heroes Hang When Traitors Triumph
Date: 2015-05-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=kGlaa2h2PMQ
Description: A professional writer since 1975, Michael Walsh provides international media with articles covering human, global and political issues. He joins us to speak on the subject matter of his latest books, “Heroes Hang When Traitors Triumph” and “Heroes of the Reich.” In the first hour, Mike gives an overview of the negative propaganda surrounding the period of the Russian Revolution to the end of Nazi Germany. We consider why it is essential to look back to the stories of the defeated during this time frame when scrutinizing the post-WWII reconstruction era controlled by the banking system and mainstream media. Mike takes us back to the story of the iconic Lawrence of Arabia, a highly principled man who was deeply opposed to a war with Germany and ultimately removed from the equation. Then, we discuss Britain’s track record of widespread meddling and backstabbing and its pro-WWII lobby campaign that set the narrative against the Germans despite an overwhelming opposition to the war by her people. Mike identifies how the supposed evil ideology of Hitler could have been so attractive to intelligent academics during his chancellorship, and why so much conflicting propaganda popped up around Germany, who at the time was one of the most prosperous countries in the world. We move on to deliberate the globalist program of suppressing the best expressions of mankind, such as the heroic Norwegian figure Vidkun Quisling, who was a champion for the Ukrainian people and later vilified by hypocrites. In the second hour, we delve deeper into the story of Holodomor, the genocide of ethnic Ukrainian people carried out by the Soviet Union. Mike explains how the Bolshevik occupied Russia robbed and starved the Ukrainians as a means to repay Wall Street for financing the Russian Revolution. Later, we look at today’s shifting political narrative and the watering down of negative publicity encircling violent and radical factions that are being used for NATO’s ends. We also discuss how National Socialism could have been seen as the only viable option in the fight against Communism and, conversely, how Communism once seemed to be a feasible way out of the suffering brought on by Capitalism. At the end, we compare the current state of the EU and US to what was happening in the Eastern Bloc 25 years ago, emphasizing the importance of reconciling the past century of history in order to understand the root of our present identity crisis.

Title: Neil Kramer - Tools for Global Uniformity: Human Rights, Discrimination & Equality
Date: 2015-05-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=uk2QlvUmkX8
Description: Red Ice Radio - Neil Kramer - Tools for Global Uniformity: Human Rights, Discrimination & Equality

Neil Kramer is a British philosopher and esotericist. His work focuses principally on spirituality, mysticism, and metaphysics. He explores the relationship between inner development and the many social and cultural factors that influence our everyday lives by drawing attention to embracing truth, confronting the negative, and transforming self. Neil returns to Red Ice Radio to pick up on our last discussion on tribal heritage, taking the concept a bit further to include problems that stem from misconceptions about human rights, the promises of equality, and self-censorship. Neil defines what he calls the Empire, or the system that is set against the growth of man, and outlines the importance of recognizing that these entities are designed to be part of our spiritual development. We consider the media’s focus on race, migration, sexual orientation and equality and how these headlines have been formulated to invoke division and polarization amongst tribes. Neil draws connections from the formation of the UN’s 1946 Commission on Human Rights to the current policies that appear to champion freedom and wellbeing, but ultimately seek to condition people to believe in an unnatural sense of sameness and uniformity amongst individuals and across cultures. Neil emphasizes the primary meaning of discrimination, a word that has been used to prevent people from making moral observations or expressing any sort of disapproval. In the second segment, we take a closer look at the war on individuality that has been dramatically reshaping our natural sense of belonging and diversity since WWII, and the destructive forces that enter the vacuum created by the disavowing of will and power. Further, Neil elucidates the general principles of preciousness and sacredness and following one’s own heart. Later, we talk about the significance of knowing one’s ancestral relationship to the lands and distinguishing the incredible healing powers that certain atmospheres provide. Our conversation closes on the ideas of transmutation and of living life as a sovereign entity of divinity in connection with real wisdom and authenticity.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Tom Goodrich & Kyle Hunt - Hellstorm: The Documentary
Date: 2015-05-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XuJ-Vg2MEss
Description: Tom Goodrich has been a professional writer for the past thirty years. In addition to articles, blogs and movie scripts, Tom has written a dozen books. Kyle Hunt received his Bachelor of Arts in psychology and is best known for founding the Renegade Broadcasting network. Tom and Kyle return to the program to discuss their monumental collaboration, the documentary film Hellstorm, based on Tom’s book and produced by Kyle. In the first hour, we discuss the impetus of the film, which is to expose the mountain of hate, lies and propaganda that was heaped upon the defeated German nation in the time period surrounding WWII, in what is truly the darkest and best kept secret in world history. We look at the relevance of unmasking the accepted history of WWII, a narrative that fundamentally excludes the truth about the horrific slaughter of tens of millions of innocent German civilians by Soviet communists. We talk about the massive amount of money that has been dumped into Israel as a result of the “crimes” for which Germany has been forced to pay reparations. Then, we consider why the success story of Hitler’s Nazi Germany was so dangerous to the rest of the world. In the members’ hour, we look back to the tremendous movement of German people at the tail end of WWII that was punctuated by the tragic sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff in the Baltic Sea, resulting in the largest loss of human lives at sea in recorded history. Tom details the gruesome lead-up to this unfathomable mass murder – a killing, raping, and torture spree unleashed on the Germans in a sadistic and depraved display of power by the Russians and Americans alike. Later, we discuss the psychological devastation of WWII that continues to plague our world. In conclusion, we examine the underpinnings of the present-day war industry.

Title: Radio 3Fourteen - Carol Kwiatkowski - Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals: Are We Threatening Our ...
Date: 2015-05-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=k0Mkoj5i4Dw
Description: Radio 3Fourteen Carol Kwiatkowski - Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals: Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence and Survival?

Dr. Carol Kwiatkowski is the Executive Director of The Endocrine Disruption Exchange (TEDX) and an Assistant Professor Adjunct at the University of Colorado at Boulder in the Department of Integrative Physiology. Dr. Kwiatkowski oversees the development and execution of all of TEDX’s programs, which are dedicated to compiling and disseminating scientific evidence on the health and environmental damage caused by low-level exposure to chemicals, primarily those that interfere with hormone, or endocrine, action, otherwise known as endocrine disruptors. Carol begins with an overview of the endocrine system and function and details the three main routes in which endocrine disruptors enter the body. We discuss how the increasing daily toxic burden our bodies are subjected to is leading to increasing rates of chronic disease and disorders. Carol explains the website tool she developed for TEDX, the Critical Windows of Development, which presents a timeline of how the human body develops in the womb. She describes some of the animal research that shows how low-dose exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as those found in plastics, during development results in altered health outcomes, including the feminization of boys, diabetes and obesity. We consider the health effects of water pollution, synthetic fragrances in household and personal care products, fossil fuel extraction processes, and exposure to pesticides. Carol emphasizes the simple strategy of learning more and using less when it comes to the array of chemical laden products that are made abundantly available for mass consumption. Further, she stresses the fact that we can’t afford to wait for science to conduct the studies that will lead to legislation based on the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Brian Anse Patrick - The Ten Commandments of Propaganda
Date: 2015-05-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=umegc2AyXK0
Description: Dr. Brian Anse Patrick is a professor of communication at the University of Toledo. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in research methods, group communication, propaganda and persuasion. He is also a nationally recognized expert on American gun culture as well as the author of many scholarly papers and five books, including The Ten Commandments of Propaganda. In this discussion, we start by looking at the definition of propaganda and where it all began. Brian explains the creation of the Committee on Public Information and its role in persuading American public opinion during World War I, an implementation that would shift other propaganda campaigns into full gear. We consider emotion as an element of propaganda, how human behavior is altered through group interaction, and the need for belonging and an explanation of a higher order that motivates people to buy into marketing schemes. Brian then takes us through the commandments of propaganda beginning with the control of the flow of information, and he uses examples from the worlds of gun culture and academia to demonstrate just how these finely honed tools have been used for the purpose of our subversion and manipulation. We speak to the censoring effects of political correctness and Brian clarifies how group pressure is used to the advantage of horizontal propaganda. In the member’s segment, Brian continues with the 5th propaganda tool, cognitive penetration, and we talk about how this method for cutting through information overload is dumbing down the masses. Further, we examine how socialization propaganda is erasing the meaning of our history while destroying creativity and individualism. Then, we get into reverse psychology and the sneaky methods used by NGOs to sway public opinion. We consider how propaganda often appeals to our weakest natures and persuades us to indulge the ego, replacing religion and dogma with the media-based judgements. Our discussion ends with an analysis of the ahistorical standpoint of modern high schools and universities and how socialist movements are being used to control the narrative both now and for the future.

Title: Radio 3Fourteen - Seana Fenner - Odinism, Traditional Tribalism & The Noble Virtues
Date: 2015-05-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=C_kLMbCVkmE
Description: Seana Fenner, also known as Odinia, is the founder of Odinia International, a worldwide native European Odinist organization whose headquarters are based in Hawai`i. She did her graduate work in archaeology at Oxford, has created and taught archaeoastronomy courses for the physics department at the University of Hawai`i, and worked for the NASA Infrared Telescope. She has two upcoming books, one on archaeoastronomy and another on Odinist ritual. Fenner is the author and narrator of the Odinist podcast video redes (sermons) and blots (rituals) on the Odinistpodcast Channel on youtube. In this interview, we touch on Fenner's awakening to Odinism and look at the hurdles faced by those who are indoctrinated to filter religion through a Semitic lense. We compare Odin the King God to the monotheistic father god of Abrahamic religions, and Seana highlights the 9 Noble Virtues that form the base of Odinist ethics. Then, Seana delves into civil rights challenges commonly faced by Odinist kindreds as well as the thousand year history of persecution of Odinists. We consider the differences between universalist religious practices and the traditional tribalism that is adhered to by Odinists, and we look upon some of the wonderful customs associated with Beltaine or Walpugisnacht. Further, Seana emphasizes how Christian customs have distorted the original context of our ancient European traditions in the name of egalitarianism. We also explore why actively participating in our own culture is so very important for European folk in preserving diversity and embracing the spiritual manifestation of its people. We conclude with a look at the current decaying state of so many virtue-less Western ideologies that have truly created the perfect platform for celebrating meritocracy and the rebirth of Odinism.

Date: 2015-05-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gHtyv8R7z2o
Description: Ken Rohla is a natural health educator and inventor specializing in rejuvenation and cellular regeneration. Formally educated in electrical engineering and computer science, Ken worked for 23 years in the medical industry, then became certified as a natural health educator in 2005. In this discussion, we begin with a broad look at the vaccine industry and the detrimental implications of mandatory vaccinations. Ken explains some simple remedies that can be used to prevent or heal damage from vaccines. He gives an overview of scalar waves and how this energy can be altered at a subatomic level in the body to promote healing and wellness. We talk about the effects of radiation fallout from Fukushima and other nuclear radiation disasters, and Ken emphasizes some of the nontoxic technologies available to neutralize and clean up the mess in our bodies and environments. In the second hour, Ken names and defines key supplements and nutrients for detoxifying and healing the body from damaging exposure to everyday pollutants. We discuss the issues of GMO foods and organic food options that are extremely lacking in nutrients. Ken makes note of the solutions available for individuals to get nutrient dense, inexpensive superfoods by growing indoors using hydroponic and aquaponics tower gardens with high Ormus nutrients. Further, we discuss the different psychic forces on the planet battling for control of our minds and how we can unplug from the programming. Lastly, we look at the best methods for filtering and cleaning up water.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Alex Newman - Crimes of the Educators
Date: 2015-05-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=jxBJ2x31Zqs
Description: Alex Newman is an international journalist, educator, author, and consultant. In addition to serving as president of a small media and information consulting firm, he writes for a wide array of publications in the United States and abroad. He currently serves as a foreign correspondent for The New American magazine and teaches advanced economics to high school seniors. He has co-authored two books, including a just-released major exposé, "Crimes of the Educators: How Utopians Are Using Government Schools To Destroy America's Children," the topic of our discussion. Alex starts the conversation with a brief overview of UNESCO, the largely socialist and communist-led United Nations organization designed to influence and create standards for education, science and culture on a global scale. He explains UNESCO’s Education for All initiative, which seeks to make mandatory changes in the values and beliefs of all of humanity under the guise of educating. Alex reveals some of the very startling ideas that hatched this international scheme, along with the big money that has funded its methodology. We delve into Common Core and the “look-say” reading method, curriculums that are destroying early literacy education and usurping the role of parents into the state. Further, we discuss how billions of dollars of Obama stimulus money has been used to strong-arm state education systems into surrendering to the Common Core consortium. We take a close look at the role public schools are playing in the globalist agenda to socialize Western civilization via dumbing down the population and chipping away at family values. In the second segment, we talk about homeschooling’s tremendous opportunity for parents in combatting this war on intelligence. Alex speaks about how the "sustainability" movement has snuck into schools, where our children are being prepared to be "green, global citizens, " in order to fulfill the vision of UN’s Agenda 21. We examine the heightening levels of immigration across Europe and America, where native populations are plummeting while individual liberties and Western traditions are being destroyed. Alex points to the blatant criminal activity of our educational system, including treason and contributing to the delinquency of minors. At the end, we touch on the declining state of Sweden, which appears to be the blueprint for flushing all of society right down the totalitarian drain.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Patrick Wood - Technocracy Rising
Date: 2015-05-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_CwHlRR80AM
Description: Patrick Wood is an author and lecturer who has studied elite globalization policies since the late 1970's, when he partnered with the late Antony C. Sutton to coauthor Trilaterals Over Washington. Patrick is with us to introduce his latest book, Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation. This follow-up to his works on the Trilateral Commission details how the organization quietly adopted a modified version of historic technocracy to craft a movement it called a “New International Economic Order.” Patrick outlines where the technocracy movement took root, and how this ideology ended up producing programs such as Sustainable Development, Agenda 21, Green Economy and Smart Growth. He defines the technocratic economic system that was born during the 1930’s Great Depression, designed to replace capitalism’s price based system with an energy based system and currency. We discuss the philosophy at the heart of technocracy, envisaging how this “rule by experts” becomes problematic when a few select people take over a movement and manipulate it for their best interests. We compare technocracy to transhumanism and scientism, with common threads ultimately leading to a scientific dictatorship masked as a utopian dream. In the members’ hour, Patrick emphasizes the core of transhuman values, which are based in completely transcending the human condition. Then, he explains the five requirements of technocracy and how mass surveillance and data fusion programs already in place are the first steps to implementing a worldwide digitized control system. We discuss the banking industry’s role in the transformation of the current economic system and the shady opportunities that could arise with the destruction of the free market. Further, we look at the scam of environmentalism and the 1992 Earth Summit conference that produced the Agenda 21 document. We also connect the dots to the war on self-determination that is being waged through educational programs like Common Core. We wrap up with an analysis of the overextended state of our financial world, with the ever-present members of the technocratic elite pushing capitalism to its limits.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Mike Campbell - Hour 1 - The Disappearance of Amelia Earhart: FDR’s Cover-Up
Date: 2015-04-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=WeS1aFirg-0
Description: Mike Campbell spent nine years as an active-duty Navy print and broadcast journalist and 21 years as a Navy civilian writer and Air Force public affairs officer. He is the author of With Our Own Eyes: Eyewitnesses to the Final Days of Amelia Earhart, and his second book on the Earhart case, Amelia Earhart: The Truth at Last, greatly expands upon the important eyewitness accounts of former American GIs who participated in the 1944 Battle of Saipan. Mike begins by explaining how he was assigned to write an article on America’s “First Lady of Flight” in 1988 and subsequently met author Thomas E. Devine during his research, who proclaimed the presence and death of Amelia Earhart and her copilot Fred Noonan on the island of Saipan after their disappearance in July 1937. Mike gives us the two versions of the story behind the vanishing of the most famous woman in the world at this time in history and highlights the sheer magnitude of the lie that has been perpetuated into present day. He talks about Earhart’s bizarre radio behavior on the day of her world famous attempt to circumnavigate the globe, the accounts of a controlled crash-landing of Earhart’s Electra NR16020 in the water off the coast of Mili Atoll seen and corroborated by many natives, and reports of an execution by the Japanese military officials. We look at the climate of the relationship between the US and Japan during this timeframe, and consider the suggestions that Earhart and Noonan were acting as spies. Mike talks about the astronomically expensive search that was conducted by the US Navy and Coast Guard around the Marshall Islands, and new evidence that indicates the US government had already cracked the codes of Japanese intelligence and knew exactly where Earhart was. In the second half, we discuss the establishment’s complete aversion to the truth of the Earhart case, pointing to a top-down cover-up orchestrated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and designed to protect his legacy. Further, Mike connects the dots to many officials and that were involved in the whitewashing and disposal of evidence that served to curtail a US military confrontation with Japan and further solidified the modern Democratic Party. In conclusion, Mike tells us about the forgotten research of Fred Goerner that was swept under the rug during the 1960s along with the legend of Earhart’s Electra landing that is no mystery in Marshallese culture.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Brandon Martinez - Hour 1 - The Creation of Israel & The ISIS Conspiracy
Date: 2015-04-30
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=r8OeQcpAYJA
Description: Brandon Martinez is an independent writer and journalist from Canada who specializes in foreign policy issues, international affairs and 20th and 21st century history. For years he has written on Zionism, Israel-Palestine, American and Canadian foreign policy, war, terrorism and deception in media and politics. He is the author of Grand Deceptions, Hidden History and The ISIS Conspiracy. Brandon is with us to give his take on the ISIS conspiracy and the array of terrorism plots that have been used to manipulate the masses and shape foreign policy. We begin with a look at the state of mainstream journalism today and the opinions of popular culture that are defined by reporting that sticks to largely unchallenged official narratives. We consider how the powers that be are able to maintain protected status and convince society to relinquish freedoms via manipulating language and demonizing criticism of authority. Brandon takes us through the history of recent wars that have been predicated on fabricated terrorist attacks, and he outlines the backdrop of lies and guilt on which the state of Israel has been built. Martinez details the fine points in the hidden story behind the World Wars, and explains how Hitler and Germany was pushed and consequently used in order to justify the creation of Israel. In the second segment, we move forward to the history and origins of Al Qaeda, with a ‘terrorist’ agenda contrived by the CIA, backed up by the Saudi Wahhabi regime and brought to fruition through Pentagon propaganda. Brandon expounds how the US has managed to justify continued occupation in Iraq while instigating a major regime change in Libya, leading to conflict in the Muslim world and eventually giving birth to the ISIS movement. Further, he gets into the Globalist-Zionist destabilization agenda that has been exported to the Middle East and northern Africa, designed to divide and conquer countries that refute western imperialism. We chew over the many indications that ISIS is a proxy force acting out a series of fabricated ‘terror events’ staged for the purpose of implementing an Orwellian police state across Western countries. Our discussion ends with some thoughts on the major contradictions in government that are casting light on the illegitimacy of democracy and the psychopathic power elite, setting the stage for a major paradigm shift in the ruling structure of our world.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Marian Van Court - Hour 1 - Eugenics vs. Dysgenics & Dropping IQ Levels Worldwide
Date: 2015-04-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6Lm1Sf8NNj0
Description: Marian Van Court is an independent scholar who has published many scholarly papers on eugenics and is the founder of the Future Generations website. She has conducted original research on IQ and fertility, and was first to discover the presence of dysgenic fertility in the US for most of the 20th century. She joins us to speak about the topics of some of her papers, including “The Case for Eugenics in a Nutshell,” “Massive Anti-Eugenics Hoax Uncovered: A Radical New Interpretation of the History of Eugenics,” and “Against Good Breeding: Understanding Jewish Opposition to Eugenics.” Marian begins by explaining the definition of eugenics and the problems surrounding the incorrect characterizations given to this subject, many of which are steeped in the fear created by propaganda campaigns. We take a look at how eugenics became unfashionable during WWII when Hitler’s name became associated with it along with genocide and mass murder. Then, Marian talks about the real face of eugenics in Israel, where it is has been widely practiced by the Jews since antiquity. We then discuss the benefits of raising the IQ of the population and how our genetic endowment for intelligence is rapidly decreasing. Further, Marian explains how the availability of birth control and the government’s encouragement of dysgenics is exacerbating the problem of fewer intelligent women producing offspring. In the second hour, we consider the course of dysgenics and the entanglement of economic issues that have caused those of lower intelligence to produce more and more offspring. Marian discusses the difficulties in exploring a non-PC subject such as eugenics and the disinformation that has led to a collective disassociation of the unpopular topic. We conclude with some thoughts on how we can un-demonize the field of eugenics and promote practical solutions for the betterment of the human race.

Title: Insight - A New Stockholm To Be Built Within 6 Years
Date: 2015-04-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=w7IaCcAJQwY
Description: The Swedish political elite have plans to build a new city, funded entirely by Swedish taxpayers, to accommodate the massive wave of incoming immigrants. This radical plan also proposes the confiscation of summer homes and the conversion of old historical buildings and churches in order to facilitate the arrival of new immigrants. Meanwhile, Sweden's welfare system is plummeting as politicians suffer from Stockholm syndrome, trying to be a "humanitarian superpower." Native Swedes have been chosen to carry the weight of the world, sacrificing themselves on the altar of multiculturalism.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Joseph Atwill & Jerry Russell - Hour 1 - J.D. Salinger & The Freemason in the Rye
Date: 2015-04-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=sUHvCaSFeOg
Description: Joseph Atwill & Jerry Russell - Hour 1 - J.D. Salinger & The Freemason in the Rye

Joseph Atwill is an independent scholar whose revolutionary approach to understanding the Christian Gospels opened up the hidden history of Western Civilization to Joseph, which enabled him to recognize the typology that underlies stories by authors such as Marlowe and Shakespeare. Jerry Russell obtained a MSEE from Stanford University, went on to complete a doctorate in cognitive psychology at the University of Oregon. From 99 to 2001, he became increasingly dismayed by economic and political events, including the 9/11 ‘terrorist’ attacks, and began devoting his time to researching elite criminality and conspiracy. Our discussion concerns Atwill’s recent article, The Freemason in the Rye, which exposes the many mysteries attached to J D Salinger’s 1951 novel, Catcher in the Rye. To begin, Atwill explains the language of the oligarchs, typology, an understanding of which gives new meaning to the seemingly incomprehensible story of Holden Caulfield. We look at why this morally destructive book has remained on mandatory reading lists for American high school students, and how it has come to be associated with many famous assassinations. Joseph outlines how the entirety of the book is basically a cryptic representation of Caulfield going through the levels of Freemasonry, with a central mystery concerning the identity of the secret society, and an unknown oath that is eventually pledged “to the death” by this essentially degenerate anti-hero. We consider Salinger’s background and the time frame that Catcher in the Rye emerges, which coincides with the beginning of the psychedelic drug culture in the late 50s, produced and funded by the covert CIA operation MKUltra. Joseph and Jerry give examples of post WWII government mind control experiments that were done to debase and control the masses by promoting the acceptance of sex, drugs and rock & roll while destroying traditional family values. In the second half, we take a deeper look at the question of the big “F*** You” repeatedly presented in the book. We weigh up how the book, amongst others, including the Christian Gospels and works by Shakespeare, has been used by the vain oligarchs to covertly depict their sick and destructive agendas. In conclusion, Atwill goes into the symbolic nature of the Beatles song “I am the Walrus,” a sick genocidal homage to the generation that they helped lead off a cliff.

Title: Red Ice Radio Mike Cross Hour 1 Mechanisms of Guilt, Consumerism & Low Birth Rates
Date: 2015-04-22
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=btTbrjQcRbE
Description: Mike Cross - Mechanisms of Guilt, Consumerism & Low Birth Rates

Mike Cross is the author of the Freedom from Conscience book series that discusses psychopaths and their relation to politics, society and personal relationships. Mike is a resident of Stockholm and teaches psychology and international finance. He returns to Red Ice Radio to discuss psychopathy, societal control by the elite, and how to break away from the conformity that has western society within its grip. In the first half, Mike describes the basis of the main character of his books, an anti-heroine politician who embodies many traits associated with psychopathy. The story of her journey serves to expose the deep corruption in government, helping the reader to understand how psychopathy works in the real world. We consider the mechanism of guilt in the social order and the lack thereof in the elite class that runs society. Mike illustrates how the machine of consumerism is fed by irrational desires that are bred into our subconscious through the conditioning of acceptance. We talk about the difficulties in breaking patterns that go against the norms of the masses and the importance of connecting with others who share alternative values in order to disconnect from the globalist agenda. In the members’ hour, we contemplate the issue of low birth rates in the west and the deeper question of why there are forces aimed at getting people not to have children. Mike outlines the work of Edward Bernays, who greatly influenced America’s shift to materialism and turn to consumerism as a religion. We reflect on changing birth rates around the globe, the promotion of population control, and the media’s anti-family viewpoint that has infected the ideals of families and would-be parents. Further, we ponder the consequences of population replacement migration, along with the psychological issues that result from the masses living clustered together in cities where there is no spiritual connection to the land, the past or one’s heritage. We look at the reflections of idiocracy showing through in our modern cultures and psychopathic world of politics, and we wrap up with a call for proudly honoring and preserving the awesome ancestral spirit and lineage of the human race.

Description: Red Ice Radio - Daniel Spaulding - Hour 1 - Transvaluation of Values & Cyclical Pattern of Social Decline

Daniel Spaulding earned a BA in English literature from Bridgewater State University. He currently works and lives in Seoul, South Korea, where he began contributing to several online projects, including The Soul of the East and Alternative Right. His writings focus on foreign policy, politics, philosophy, and Eastern and Western culture. Our conversation with Daniel begins with a look at the outside influences that have contributed to ISIS’s uprising and leap to super-human status. We consider the ridiculous claims coming out of Washington that have triggered a surge of mainly young Muslim men to uproot themselves and join in on Obama’s manufactured war party games. Daniel speaks about the history of radical Muslim groups playing on the political social stage, enticed by the prospect of taking on the infidels and filling the void of soulless materialism and consumerism. We talk about the trending transvaluation of values in the west, the celebration of the ugly and freakish, and the nature of egalitarianism. Daniel relates how this technocratic social engineering is part of the cyclical pattern of social decline and degeneration. In the members’ half, we examine the potentiality of penetrating the power structure’s bubble by breaking down the dichotomies of globalism, the monoculture/multicultural experiment and economic hegemony. We consider the destruction of diversity amongst distinct cultures that are oppressed by the façade of politics heavily invested in certain myths, preventing the tribes of our world from seeking allies and banding together. Daniel speaks of the signs that the oligarchs have run out of plays, and makes suggestions for overcoming the mass media monster to break free from the false atmosphere of double standards and one-sided narratives. We conclude with an evaluation of the changing nature of language and humans’ hardwired mechanism of discrimination.

Description: Red Ice Radio - Dr. Joseph Mercola - Hour 1 - How Prolonged Sitting Kills You, Effortless Healing & GMO Labeling Initiative

Dr. Joseph Mercola is a licensed osteopathic and board-certified family medicine doctor who believes that natural “whole person” treatment is the best way to maintain a healthy lifestyle. He aims to transform the medical paradigm to improve people’s quality of life. His official website, Mercola.com, contains thousands of natural health articles and proven, holistic recommendations. Dr. Mercola is also the author of two best selling books, and he is with us to discuss his latest publication, Effortless Healing: 9 Simple Ways to Sidestep Illness, Shed Excess Weight, and Help Your Body Fix Itself. Our conversation begins with a look at the conventional, pharmaceutical based medical philosophy driven by sophisticated claims and big profits. Dr. Mercola explains how he got started in the Health Liberty Initiative, an organization dedicated to promoting the removal of fluoride from water and mercury from dental work, as well as spreading awareness about the dangers of vaccines and more. Mercola talks about the hazards of excess sitting, the benefits of intermittent, high-intensity cardiovascular and strength training, and approaches to wellness that replicate our ancestral patterns. He details the causes of insulin resistance, the primary factor in many illnesses, and provides dietary guidelines for resolving this widespread epidemic. Then, we consider veganism, the benefits of animal and vegetable fats, and the right amount of protein in a healthy diet. Further, we deconstruct how key opinion leaders in healthcare are influenced by big pharma investments, along with the money trail of the vaccine industry. In the second half, Dr. Mercola shares how he got interested in the GMO debate and became involved in spreading awareness about the dangers of glyphosate contaminated food. We discuss the dire situation that has emerged from a world fed from genetically engineered agriculture and the devastating havoc that chemicals are reaping on humans and animals. Moving on, Dr. Mercola addresses the best methods for obtaining pure, clean water and explains the complex ecosystem of the gut. We conclude with some helpful gardening tips, health foods to avoid, and ways to take control of individual health that are simple and affordable.

Title: Red Ice Radio - E Michael Jones - Hour 1 - Libido Dominandi: Sexual Liberation & Political Control
Date: 2015-04-15

Description: Historian and former Professor, Dr. E. Michael Jones is editor of Culture Wars Magazine and author of many books including Libido Dominandi: Sexual Liberation & Political Control, The Jewish Revolutionary Spirit and Its Impact on World History, and Barren Metal: A History of Capitalism as the Conflict between Labor and Usury. Dr. Jones is with us to provide his perspective on pornography and the role its exploitation has in the capitalistic subversion of cultures around the globe. We begin with a look at India, a civilization experiencing a rampant rape crisis that has developed since the free exchange of pornography has been allowed over its internet. Jones gives an overview of the sexualization of America through the conduit of Hollywood films. We talk about the steady normalization of degeneracy and corruption occurring in the mainstream and the political and social control achieved through the manipulation of people’s desires. Further, we consider the manifestation of socialist central planning that drives cultures away from their true identities, and this capitalist form of warfare that feeds on exploiting illicit passions. We continue in the second half with Jones’ take on the power and effects of globalism in subverting ancient cultures like India. We discuss how India managed to suppress pornography to satisfy the moral standards of its people until recently and how the shift to sexualization resulted in a reorienting of consumption patterns, the upsetting of relationships between men and women, and alignment with the argument that subversive activity is a democratic right. Later, Jones describes how CIA elites took over the Catholic Church and unleashed an unforeseen plague of sexualization, capitalism and usury. He comments on the ancient roots of Catholicism, Christian monarchies ruled by Jewish financiers across Europe, and the revolting Talmud that refutes and demonizes all things Christian. In conclusion, Dr. Jones speaks of the abandonment of logos in Western culture and the need to reclaim our connection to these fundamental values.

Description: Radio 3Fourteen - Angelo John Gage - National Youth Front vs. ASU's "The Problem of Whiteness" Course

Angelo John Gage is a political activist who is fighting against Marxism in all its abominable forms. A former US Marine, Gage went on to graduate from the International Center for Positive Change and Hypnosis as a NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) Master Practitioner and Conversational Hypnotist. He also chairs the National Youth Front, an elite youth organization dedicated to the preservation of all White people, including their nations and cultures across the globe. Angelo joins us to talk about the anti-White agenda and what groups like the NYF are doing to combat the massive PSYOP warfare directed at Whites. We discuss Arizona State University's recent course offering of "The Problem of Whiteness," and the victory that NYF achieved by calmly and fearlessly standing up to this blatant defamation of Whites. Angelo points out several other incidents of White discrimination across the board, and the liberal agenda that keeps Whites from realizing their race is under attack. Further, we look at the immense shift to war mode that has occurred since 9/11, and the fact that many glaring, unanswered questions are resulting in a serious mistrust in government. We get into the detrimental effects of the feminist movement, a cyberspace non-reality created by technology and the battle of hearts and minds that is finally triggering a much needed spiritual revolution. In conclusion, Angelo highlights strategies for making progress in this numbers game, creating a religion of embracing self-improvement and removing the toxicity in our lives, and staying with a simple, humorous approach in inspiring our brothers and sisters to take action so we can move forward and construct a harmonious, healthy, and honorable future.

Aleksandr Dugin is one of the best-known writers and political commentators in post-Soviet Russia. In addition to the many books he has authored on political, philosophical and spiritual topics, he currently serves on the staff of Moscow State University, and is the intellectual leader of the Eurasia Movement. For more than a decade, he has also been an advisor to Vladimir Putin and others in the Kremlin on geopolitical matters, being a vocal advocate of a return of Russian power to the global stage, to act as a counterweight to American domination. Dugin joins us to speak about the subject of his book, The Fourth Political Theory. He begins with an overview of this political vision, one that is a fundamental criticism of liberalism in all forms, but does not fall into communism, nationalism or fascism. Dugin explains the need for critically thinking people in the world to imagine an alternative to liberalism, and how this very confusing and destructive ideology is truly a totalitarian way of thinking. We consider the key liberalist issues as being tests to see how far people are willing to go to completely give up traditional values, and we look at the globalist capital system that is exacerbating the identity crisis of the west. In the second half, Dugin details the fine points of Eurasianism, a vision of world history based on geopolitics and the virility of diverse civilizations. We look at Russia’s place amongst the global elite, her unwavering sovereignty that will ultimately resist globalization, and a deeply rooted cultural dimension that cannot be divided from Europe. Dugin speaks of the US’s constant meddling and manufacturing of conflicts between Russia and Europe, and we discuss the importance of creating a strong European cooperative to balance the liberalist power monopoly. In conclusion, Dugin notes his contributions to Putin’s current ideology and the rising influence of the Forth Political Theory in liberating Russia from the globalist grip.

Description: Apple is on the dark slippery slope of censorship. The bigger and more powerful Apple, and other corporations become, the more power they will have to shape public opinion, depending on what they deem acceptable. Now days, since someone is always “offended,” reporting at the click of a button, where does Apple draw the line between what subject matters are acceptable and what is not allowed? Lana talks about iTunes censorship of her talk radio program, Radio 3Fourteen.

Prof. Vasile Lupasc is a historian and a writer who graduated from the Faculty of History at the University of Bucharest, Romania. He is also eight times world champion in karate and a member of the International Grandmaster Society. Vasile’s interest for both history and martial arts has lead him to recover and convey the world of ancient warriors in a clear, compelling and thrilling way. Prof. Lupasc joins us to speak about his writings on King Vlad Tepes, the subject of seven books he has authored, including Draculea, The Engraved Chest of Time - The True Story of King Vlad Dracula as Told by His Royal Knights. We begin with a look at the history of Europe, with a heritage often shrouded in tales of war and invented myths, and consider the origins of vampire folklore. Vasile gives an overview of factual accounts of King Vlad of Romania, who reigned during the mid-15th century and admirably protected his country from conquest by the Ottoman Empire. He makes comparisons to the very different story of Dracula as told by Bram Stoker and Hollywood. We learn about the early years of King Vlad, along with the legends that made him such a fascinating and feared leader. Vasile explains the war tactics used by Vlad and his soldiers in fighting the Turks, and gives an interpretation of the intricacies of his governance of the Romanian people. In conclusion, we discuss the transmuting landscape of leadership across Europe, the unfavorable effects of the EU, and the changes of modernity that are leading to a loss of identity and cultural recognition in the Western world.

Joshua Blakeney is a freelance journalist originally from the UK based in Canada. He has been Press TV's Canadian correspondent since April 2012. He is a co-host of The Real Deal radio show and co-founder of Non-Aligned Media. In 2014, after extensive archival research at the Diet National Library in Japan, Blakeney published Japan Bites Back: Documents Contextualizing Pearl Harbor, the topic of our discussion. Joshua begins with an overview of his journey into the world of WWII revisionist history, a subject that is far less taboo in Japan than it is in the west. He speaks about the backdrop of Japan as the perceived aggressor in the Pearl Harbor operation, and the threat of communism that went against Japan’s unique, homogenized and autonomous way of living. Joshua explains the history of Japan’s interests in preserving the Asiatic agrarian societies and the need to expel White influence. Then, we compare Pan-Asianist ideology to Iran’s attempt to unify its region today. Joshua makes connections to false flag events such as Pearl Harbor and origins of wars that have been interpreted in a fraudulent manner. In the members’ segment, we weigh up the magnitude of the history of nuclear weapons used to annihilate Japan by the US in sick demonstrations of power over the Soviet Union and the east. Later, Joshua illustrates Japan’s homogenous, tight-knit culture that strongly rejects New World Order policies and multiculturalism. We discuss the need for a 3rd position to view the imported problems created by mass immigration, along with the necessity for Muslims and Whites to avoid serving Zionist interests. At the end, Joshua describes how Japan’s connection to the land and collective spirituality has allowed the country to develop a superior culture.

Rebekah Roth enjoyed a thirty year airline career working as both a flight attendant and an international purser. She was trained as an emergency medical technician and served as a volunteer firefighter. Her expertise and training as a flight attendant allowed her to research the events of September 11, 2001 with an insider's knowledge, and eventually lead her to discover details and answers to some of the most haunting questions surrounding that infamous day in our history. Rebekah is with us speak about her book, Methodical Illusion, which is the culmination of her extensive research and personal knowledge of in-flight procedures and FAA hijacking protocols. In the first segment, we learn about Rebekah's inspiration for writing the book and her process of waking up from the spell of cognitive dissonance that prevented her from wanting to take a closer look into the official story. Rebekah talks about the red flags that were present from day one, and the many anomalies that showed the orchestrators of destruction of the Twin Towers did not consult with an actual flight attendant. We discuss the mysteries of Buildings 4, 6 and 7, and the trillions of dollars that were erased with their eradication. Then, Rebekah breaks down several big key elements of the phone calls of 9/11, and how these staged recorded conversations sealed the deal for the military industrial complex to launch the War on Terror, creating the "New Pearl Harbor" that would lead to 7 Middle Eastern wars. In the members' hour, we look at the psychological warfare and brainwashing techniques used in creating a Hegelian dialectic, along with the conspired solutions to big problems that fattened the wallets of insider corporations. Rebekah gives details of the shadow government in control of everything from radar to national security, the IRS, and the health care industry. Later, Rebekah tells us how she pieced together the paths of the disappearing planes and the manipulated illusions that were created to explain away the impossible crashes. At the end, we discuss media spokespeople, with ties to Zionist circles, the funding behind technology and Israeli intelligence.

Matt Forney is an author, journalist and entrepreneur. His writing primarily focuses on masculinity, relations between men and women, literature, and American culture. Matt is a columnist for Return of Kings and Taki's Magazine, and blogs regularly at his website MattForney.com. He also writes for Reaxxion, Alternative Right and other sites. Additionally, he is the author of the self-help guide Confessions of an Online Hustler and several other books. In this program, Forney talks about how he stumbled upon the "manosphere" and became interested in the men's rights movement (MRM). He shares his criticisms of the MRM and his views on the changing cultural attitudes that have emerged as a response to the injustices instituted by feminism in the US. We discuss feminist principles that are largely unique to the West and the mindless consumerism that has led to the degradation of the nuclear family. Further, we consider the mythical privileged - White males and the special rights granted to "oppressed" groups. Matt gives an overview of some of the mainstream degenerate behaviors being normalized by the media, and the double standards of gender politics that anchor the wedge between women and men. In the second segment, Matt details the "sexodus" called Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW), a wingnut movement spawned from an unhealthy reaction to society. We look at the isolating effect of technology, the modern tribulations of our schizophrenic society, and the quest to numb the pain of existence. Later, we ponder the hive mind of leftist social justice and the slippery slope of censorship. In conclusion, we break down the anti-social nature of the younger generations and pornography's demoralizing effects on culture.

Jared Taylor is an American journalist, editor of the webzine American Renaissance and president of New Century Foundation organization, both dedicated to the study of immigration and race relations. Mr. Taylor is the author of several books and scholarly papers, including Paved with Good Intentions and White Identity: Racial Consciousness for the 21st Century. Mr. Taylor is with us to make a contribution to the extremely one-sided debate of racial equality and the delegitimization of race, human biodiversity and kinship. We begin by considering why people are so afraid of discussing race and why Whites are forbidden to organize, promote and advocate for their racial group. We discuss the established system that is designed to create hatred and distrust amongst Whites and non-whites. We consider the tremendous double standards of being branded as a racist or supremacist, the multicultural experiment, and the global history of warfare and genocide. Further, we get into White privilege, the lack of will of whites to assert their rights as a sovereign majority, and the idea that preserving race and cultural traditions is akin to cultural imperialism. In the second half, Jared speaks about the history of slavery and the notion that it is a unique sin committed by the White man. Moving on, Jared shares his interpretation of what happened in Ferguson and analyzes the propaganda machine’s role in perpetuating the acceptance of White wickedness. Further, we speak about the changing demographic landscape of America and Europe and the west’s celebration of diversity in the name of displacement and destructiveness. We end with thoughts about Whites waking up and realizing what is genuinely at stake, and the real consequences of involuntary racial integration.

John Friend is an independent blogger and journalist based in Southern California who maintains TheRealistReport.com. John focuses primarily on the events of 9/11, WWII revisionism, media deception and psychological warfare, power and influence of the Zionist Lobby in America, and the systematic assault upon and subversion of traditional Western European civilization. He is currently working on a book which will be examining and demystifying the "New World Order" conspiracy often discussed in the alternative media in an attempt to clarify the main goals and ultimate agenda of the Global Power Elite. We begin our discussion with reflections on what it’s like to awaken to the big lies, to tread into the darkness and dig into the murky areas where the truth lies, a process that is immensely difficult and depressing at best. John explains how the disillusioning events of 9/11 triggered him to take a closer look at the frightening narrative our government concocted to promote the institutionalization of the idea of the global “War on Terror.” John outlines some of the key foreign policies hatched from the fiasco, who was in control of the World Trade Center complex at the time, and Israeli players who had direct ties to the crime ring involved. Then, we consider the roles of the mainstream media/entertainment industrial complex and the educational system in perpetuating our fabricated history, the demonization of truth seekers who dare to criticize the diabolical, tyrannical agendas these events continue to promote, and the ongoing assault on Western traditionalism. In the members’ hour, we weigh up what it takes to objectively analyze the verifiable facts of the multitude of controversial and taboo issues eroding away our cultural and moral framework. We deliberate the urgency for informed, talented individuals to get motivated, take a stand, and spread the truth widely in the spirit of love and concern. We end with strategies for breaking through to our overwhelmingly politically correct, programmed, monoculture so they can effectively hear the alarm being sounded and join in the fight for the best interests of Western civilization.

Born on the tough streets of the Bronx, Justin Garcia or "MC," as he's called in his martial arts academies is behind The Pressure Project podcast and The Jungle Gym martial arts academy. A graduate of the NYC public school system, he's evolved to despise a few things gov't schooling, excuse making, and the defense of mediocrity amongst them. A married, homeschooling father of three sons and one daughter, MC spends his time lifting weights, arguing with manginas, and embracing his ever-growing role in the creation of a new generation of warriors. Justin is with us to share his wisdom in cultivating masculinity. We begin our discussion by looking at the current trend of passive, non-aggressive, feminized men who are detached from nature and have diminished communication skills. Justin talks about talents and ambitions that are sabotaged by the constant rewarding of weakness and the avoidance of any amount of pressure. He'll touch on competition as a gauge for knowing one is improving, the history of leadership amongst men, and weak egalitarian-minded individuals who are riding the coattails of previous generations. We also get into men who embrace the notions of political correctness, commercialism, and money over family, and explore the true definitions of what it means to be masculine. Then, Justin explains how the lack of men experiencing success and diversity as a tribe is creating a society of men who lack identity and can't differentiate between masculine and feminine roles. We consider feminism's role in destroying feminine virtues that have served women well since the beginning of time, the condemnation of brotherhood, and simulated pseudo-men who do not receive the feedback necessary to maintain their masculinity. We end with Justin's strategies for raising a warrior, boosting testosterone, and finding ways to experience adversity in order to embrace the power it takes to be a man.

Gilad Atzmon - Hour 1 - Zionist Pressure Groups & Jewish Identity Politics

Gilad Atzmon is a British jazz artist and author born in Israel and trained in composition and jazz at the Rubin Academy of Music, Jerusalem. He is a member of the Blockheads, founded the Orient House Ensemble in London, and has recorded and performed with many rock music legends. Gilad also writes on political matters, social issues, Jewish identity and culture. He has written two novels, and his latest book, The Wandering Who? is a study of Jewish identity politics. In the first hour, Mr. Atzmon gives an account of the recent cancellation of his scheduled performance with the Orient House Ensemble at Manchester's Royal Northern College of Music. The prestigious cultural institute gave into pressure to stop the show by the ultra-Zionist organization North West Friends of Israel (NWFOI), who accused Atzmon of "fostering anti-Semitism" and denying the holocaust. Gilad speaks about the historically strained relationship between Jews and Europeans, the questionable ethics of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS Movement) and the serious issue of British pedophile networks. Then, he talks about the controlled opposition of the Jewish anti-Zionist network, which diverts attention from Israel's ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, and the Leftist domination that has left Palestine to crumble. Gilad gets into the largely Jewish phenomenon of identity politics, the division of Europe's working class, and enforced monoculture. In an exceptional extended second half, Gilad speaks to the psychopathic principles of Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu and his process of projection. We discuss the link between the BDS boycott movement, funding from liberal Zionist George Soros, LGBTQ influence and the role of the Open Society associating gay rights with the Palestinian cause. Later, we examine the effects of splicing society into marginal discourses and the disastrous sexual revolution. In conclusion, we chew over the root cause of pervasive fear of anti-Semitism.

Sally Fallon Morell is founding president of the Weston A. Price Foundation, founder of A Campaign for Real Milk and author of the best-selling cookbook Nourishing Traditions: The Cookbook that Challenges Politically Correct Nutrition and the Diet Dictocrats. She is also the author of The Nourishing Traditions of Baby & Child Care and Nourishing Broth. Sally is with us to discuss the culinary customs of our ancestors and wise food choices that contribute to excellent overall health. She begins with the story of Dr. Weston A. Price, a dentist who studied nutrition and traveled to remote parts of the globe looking at dental health and overall health. Dr. Price discovered that groups who consumed foods with high levels of the fat soluble vitamins A, K & D had excellent teeth and general health. Sally explains how the foods that are commonly consumed today are missing the proper fats that supply these vital nutrients, leading to an appalling epidemic of chronic disease, infertility and children who suffer the consequences of parents with poor nutrition. We talk about the importance of grass-fed animal fats, the dangers of pasteurized dairy products, and the detrimental effects of following a vegan diet, particularly during pregnancy. Then, Sally explains the basic rule of nature and how flooding the body with foods that deplete vitamins, minerals and fats along with restricting essential fats leads to disease. We consider the harmful effects of fluoride as well as the vilification of raw milk. We end by looking at the importance of cholesterol and fats for healthy brain functioning, the long-term, damaging effects of GMO foods, and ways to integrate the wisdom of the ancients into our daily nourishment.

Ishtar Babilu Dingir is a former journalist from England, specializing in holistic health and environmental issues. She is now a shaman in her home town of Glastonbury in Somerset, where she concentrates on working with the spirits of the land, in order to reaffirm the sovereignty. She's also the author of The Sacred Sex Rites of Ishtar: shamanic sexual healing and sex magic, and Lord of the Dance. More recently, she has been writing about the importance of preserving race in order to access the wisdom teachings from the ancestral spirits, which is the focus of our discussion. Ishtar begins by describing the initiation, training and practices of the shaman, one who journeys into other dimensions to get guidance from entities and bring back information to the community or individuals as a form of healing. She explains about information contained in our DNA that holds the wisdom of our ancestors, and how long ago an impetus from Rome largely eradicated this knowledge. We discuss pre-Christian civilizations, the Abrahamic narrative, the Protestant movement, and hidden information that is used to disempower the masses. Further, we'll consider the identity crisis of the West, mainly caused by the metaphysical being left behind, a lost connection to our ancestors, and an unhealthy focus on materialism. Then, Ishtar speaks about the three worlds of shamanic journeying, the Fae of the Middle World who works in partnership with man and the land, the worldwide importance of the shaman in tribes prior to the agricultural phase, and the merchant class rule that is achieved by the propaganda machine. In the members' section, we explore human diversity, the shamanic consciousness, the awakening process, and ancestral wisdom that has been lost in the half-reality of the surface world. Ishtar tells about the indigenous culture of England and the ancient sites of Burrow Mump, Avebury and Glastonbury. We look at the destabilization agenda of uncontrolled immigration, the need to develop a consciousness of human biological diversity and race, and the contrived experiments of monoculture. At the end, Ishtar underlines the urgency of staying in touch with our ancestry and learning the way of the shaman as a means to awaken to one's true identity and destiny.

Ole Dammegard, is an author, investigator, former journalist, and the creator of the website Light On Conspiracies. Ole returns to the program to discuss the recent events in Paris and Copenhagen, along with the patterns of many other false flag operations and how they tie together. Ole begins by breaking down the themes and elements of major false flags operations and the reasons why the Global Elites are using this mechanism to create chaos, instill fear and take control. We'll look at the tactics of these high level, hidden criminals and who could be benefitting from these sinister plots. Ole explains the components of filmmaking and how to decipher the telltale signs of the propaganda machine working behind the scenes of the corrupt events we're seeing take place across the globe. Then, he takes us step by step through the recent shooting events in Paris, pointing out unmistakable clues of staged scenes. We talk about the media's use of repeating and looping to pump the details of these 'attacks' into our subconscious as a means for conditioning the acceptance and even the desire for a more controlled, policed, militarized and surveilled world. In the members' hour, Ole draws a clear analysis of the latest false flag event in Copenhagen, highlights clues of an impending 'event' that were placed in plain sight, and makes comparisons of the logistical pieces of the puzzle that have been echoed in similar past events. We'll look at the many identical elements that show up in these very connected events. We conclude by exploring how we can take our power back as a united, sovereign human race by becoming more aware of and alert to these trends. We discuss what can be done to disrupt the important timelines of these highly orchestrated crimes to derail these evil games and bring peace and healing to our war torn world.

Dr. Bill Warner holds a PhD in physics and math. He has been a university professor, businessman, and applied physicist. He founded and is the director of the Center for the Study of Political Islam (CSPI). Dr. Warner has produced a dozen books, including a Koran, a biography of Mohammed and a summary of the political traditions of Mohammed. He also developed the first self-study course on Political Islam. Bill joins us to speak about the history of Islam in Europe, where Islam has fought in 548 battles against the classical world of Europe. He begins by outlining the real entry of Islam in 632 after Mohammed died, a time when the majority of the Middle East was Christian. We�ll talk about the roots of slavery, which stem from Mohammed, and the millions of Europeans who were enslaved by Muslims in the name of Islam. Bill describes the doctrine of Jihad and its call for the demographic conquest of all Islamic neighbors. He explains Sharia Law�s foundational principles, including the oppression and annihilation of all Kafirs and the subjugation of all women, religious vs. political Islam, and the different versions of the Koran. Bill underscores the Jihadist quest to conquer all of Europe and the need for the West to rise up intellectually against Islam. We end by considering the push to accommodate Sharia, the damage of diversity without unity, and grassroots movements by the common man that must push us past the collective trance induced by our corrupt leadership.

Mike King is a private investigative journalist and researcher based in the New York City area. A 1987 graduate of Rutgers University, King's subsequent 27 year career in Marketing & Advertising has equipped him with a unique perspective when it comes to understanding how "public opinion" is scientifically manufactured. His website, Tomato Bubble, is a platform for disseminating alternative history, philosophy and current events. Mike returns to Red Ice Radio to enlighten listeners about his groundbreaking book, The Bad War: The Truth Never Taught About World War 2. Mike illustrates the timeline of events of this shameful episode in history beginning in 1848, where the story of WW2 begins - the year known as "The Springtime of the People," when "spontaneous" revolts broke out across Europe and South America. He explains how during this time the Rothschild family and their web of British operatives began hijacking Europe in an attempt to destabilize the Old World and bring about Democracy. We look at the establishment of the Reuters Telegram Company, the first Zionist news giant to take control of the press and the official narrative of the events leading up to WW2. Mike takes us back to the period prior to WW1 when the German Reich was formed and through its unification, Germany began to grow and out-produce both France and Britain, attracting a lot of envy. He talks about the League of the Three Emperors, an alliance organized to defend Eastern Europe by blocking British and French intrigue and suppressing internal communist movements - a defensive whose destruction would lead to the formation of the New World Order. We examine NATO, the alliance formed between Britain and France after WW1 - a corrupt and deceitful organization who sought to provoke war and dismantle empires throughout Eastern Europe. Then, Mike will explain the events leading up to WW2, including Germany's pleas for reason and peace up until the 11th hour, the blame for instigating the war Germany was tricked into accepting, the monstrous Treaty of Versailles, and the formation of the Zionist Arab Spring enclave by Lord Rothschild. In the second hour, Mike explains Poland's important role in WW2, a country that is always portrayed as a helpless innocent and a victim of Hitler's bullying, and the myth of Belgian/Dutch neutrality. Then, we'll talk about Hitler's stance against the war, his letters to the Vatican pleading for peace, and Britain's refusal to hold mediations. Further, Mike tells us about the propaganda of the controlled Western press, the vilification of Hitler, and the real Hitler who ruled the people's hearts, held nearly universal support, and was considered a national hero at the time. We'll end by discussing the genocide of Germans after the war, the atrocities and crimes against Northern Europe that have been erased from the pages of history, and what we can do to bring light to the big lie of the past 75 years of history.

Dennis Fetcho, aka "The Fetch," is the author of the Illuminatus Observer, a blog focusing on the Hermetic Qabalah. He is also the host of Inside the Eye - Live!, a news and current events streaming media radio talk show. Dennis is an American expat living in Amman, Jordan, working by day as a business strategist, specializing in telecommunications, aerospace, and defense. Dennis is here to speak about the secrets of the Kosher tax along with some of the other big anti-trust issues that are corroding Western values. Dennis begins with an explanation of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, a deregulation law that allows the sale of supplements as food with no need for proof of effectiveness or safety, resulting in an explosion of sales. Then, he describes how Kosher food certifying organizations crept in and took advantage of the boom, creating a multi-billion dollar annual market. Dennis tells about how the entire supply chain of any product that carries the prestigious Kosher mark must be certified, right down to the utensils used in processing facilities. He clarifies the differences in non-Kosher vs. Kosher standards in food processing, and explains how these Laws of Kashrus are simply superstitious traditions passed down from the Bible. Further, Dennis illustrates the countless items of food that are already inherently Kosher, along with items that are impossible to substantiate and place into this category. We also take a look at where the profits are going, the preferential treatment given to Kosher certified products in stores, and the extortion-type fees that are paid to Rabbinic Field Representatives. In the second hour, we look at the reasons why consumers buy into the Kosher racket and consider the tricks of the trade in this Jewish monopoly. We chew over many other significant issues related to this elite game and how the hypocrisy involved has held Western values under siege for years. In conclusion, we deliberate tolerance and the need to decentralize the media.

Description: Western culture has come to define itself through an alien ideology disseminated through Hollywood. It is a superimposed culture, a fantasy structure that we're all living in. True Western European values have been replaced by another, a new global religion called Hollywoodism. Who is behind this new ruling ideology, re-defining western culture?

Monica Stone joins us to speak about the subject of White Genocide in South Africa. She works with the website southafricaproject.info and also the Living Waters Foundation. Monica is committed to spreading awareness about the rape, torture, murders, and the genocide of the White South African people. We begin with a quick history lesson on South Africa, a region that was completely open in 1652 when members of Dutch East India Company arrived and settled the Cape of Good Hope, where they brought agricultural knowledge, science and math education, established public schools, property rights, boundaries, and human rights. Monica describes how things went terribly wrong, beginning in the 19th century, when the British took over the Dutch East India Company. Wars ensued in this period, which coincided with the discovery of gold, and many Afrikaners fled the area to escape suppression. Monica explains the current state of governmental affairs, a reign by the ANC that has led South Africa down a path to destruction since the end of apartheid, with the clear purpose of eradicating all Whites from the country. We look at the influx of immigrants saturating the area for the past 20+ years, putting extreme pressure on a fragile infrastructure that is not being properly maintained and bringing in more crime and racial tension. Monica tells about the rampant, deep-seated hatred for Afrikaners that has resulted in over 85,000 murders since 1994, along with an epidemic of the rape and torture of countless innocent people. Monica gives examples of what it is like living in a country where it is against the law to defend yourself against even the most unspeakable crimes. We discuss why these abysmal conditions have gotten to this point and why none of the Afrikaners? White brothers and sisters in the West are stepping up to help. Also, we take a look at the real players running the show in the ANC, a narrative that is being controlled by the Zionist media and is almost identical to that of the US. We end with some thoughts on what it will take to turn this seemingly hopeless situation around and how the people of South Africa, Europe and the US can band together to keep from being drowned by the treason running deep in all White countries.

Jon Rappoport is an investigative journalist, author and publisher of the website nomorefakenews.com. He has worked as an investigative reporter for 30 years, writing articles on politics, medicine, and health. He returns to give a continuation on the unfolding vaccine scandal. This time we look at the claim that Disneyland was at the center of a recent measles outbreak. Jon details the fraud of so called "herd immunity." We also discuss the attack on parents who choose to not vaccinate their children as the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the media have joined forced to begin the push for mandatory vaccination. We'll talk about the key studies, the efficacy of vaccinations and real statistics when it comes to vaccine damage in the United States. The MMR vaccine and autism has been known by the CDC for many years, but continues to be denied. Jon tells us more about what he calls the advent of the "synthetic population." In the second hour, we discuss what you can do to opt-out of vaccinations and what options are available to parents who don't want to jeopardize the health of their children. We continue on the incentives for the vaccine lobby and the political revolving-door between government and the pharmaceutical industry. Further, we speak on the pathology of ABC news anchor Brian Williams, who recently was caught lying and exaggerating his involvement in certain stories. This brings us to the issue of the crumbling US health care system and how Obama Care will be the final nail in the coffin of health care choices. We end on the control of the media and how many stories that should be major exclusives are simply avoided and omitted.

Chris Fogarty was raised on farm in Ireland where he worked the land with his father, and later went on to reside in the US. Mr. Fogarty has been a regular Columnist for the past nineteen years in Irish American News and is a citizen-investigator of Chicago aldermanic crime. He is the author of Ireland 1845-1850: the Perfect Holocaust, and Who Kept it 'Perfect' and he is behind irishholocaust.org. Chris joins us to speak about the Irish Holocaust and the cover-up that is accomplished by the same British terrorism and bribery that perpetrated the genocide. He explains the dark time during 1845-1850 when Ireland starved because its food, from 40 to 70 shiploads per day, was removed at gunpoint by 12,000 British constables reinforced by the British militia. Chris describes how the British completely took over 95% of Ireland’s territory, extracting all goods and wiping out at least half of the indigenous population. We’ll discuss the lie of Ireland’s “potato famine,” the official story used to explain the deaths of over 5.2 million people, which is propagated to this day – even by the Irish government, academia, and the Catholic Church. Chris gives details of his extensive research into the locations of British food removal regiments and over 170 mass graves across Ireland. He’ll explain the fear of persecution and intimidation that continues to infect Irish society in modern times. We end by considering Ireland’s long history of ethnic cleansing, the role of the government and Catholic hierarchy, and the notion that the IRA are terrorists.

Jeff Gates is an attorney, acclaimed author, and former counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance. Our guest has also served as an adviser to some 35 foreign governments. Jeff joins us to talk about his third book, Guilt By Association -- How Deception and Self-Deceit Took America to War. He begins by explaining his personal awakening to the endorsed, systemic criminality going on in the background of politics. Jeff illustrates the US’s long-term relationship with the Israeli Zionist enclave that was recognized in 1948 during Truman’s presidency – a group responsible for expanding organized crime to a global scale behind the façade of a sovereign state. He’ll give details of how this core allegiance of parasites have successfully victimized America and waged an unconventional war against the American public through domination of the “in-between domains” of media, pop culture, politics, think tanks and education. Jeff discusses the ideas of an embedded consensus, the simple math of campaign contributions, assets, and groomed politicians. We’ll consider how the US came to stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel and the role of the Israeli Lobby to take control of Congress. Then, we’ll look at Hollywood’s role in advancing the narrative, extremism in faith communities, and the challenges of a society and government that operates by a consensus. Later, Jeff talks about the war with Iran that has been ongoing since 1979, and the manipulation of intelligence that could lead America into another war. We’ll end by examining strategies that can be used to combat and bring attention to the Zionist storylines aggregated in our minds through master mythmaking and sophisticated storytelling.

Olav Torheim is a Norwegian engineer and editor of Målmannen, a journal focusing on language, culture and politics. Torheim has a PhD in Physics and worked at different research institutions in France and Germany before returning to Norway two years ago. Using Målmannen as a platform, he tries to promote a traditional Nordic and European worldview. Olav joins us to speak about the symbolic nature of language, which he studied with professor Frode Jens Strømnes (1937-2012), who used experimental methods to discover that the human brain and its functioning is conditioned by mental imagery. Olav describes his ground-breaking theories on language learning, which prove that different languages represent different mental geometries and, hence, different ways to see and conceptualize the world. The theory is opposed to the Universalist view promoted by linguistics, where all languages are seen as equivalent and, therefore, replaceable by other languages. He explains the unconscious building of mental models that occurs when children learn language, and the structural differences that exist amongst languages, such as vector vs. topological geometry. We discuss how these variances in relating to the world spatially affect our world views and shape our cultures, information that is being lost as languages disappear. In the members hour, we look at how translations of Abrahamic religious texts can result in an alteration of the geometry of statements. We consider seemingly contradictory political ideologies that all converge on the point of egalitarian universalism – modern ideas that promote universal truths and break down cultural identities. Then, we examine the rapidly multiplying problems of mass immigration in Europe, the lack of attachment the migrant people have to their own culture, and radicalization that is the result of a lost sense of belonging. Olav gives some of the alarming statistics of what is happening to the native population in Norway. Further, we talk about our atomized society that is the product of mass consumerism, slavery to the system, and our loss of connection to each other. We consider the complimentary aspects of authority and freedom, the lie of liberalist independence, and our fear of leadership. We end with some thoughts about rich cultural traditions and ideologies that are being destroyed by modern man, the superficiality of “diversity,” and ways we can promote an awareness of the misleading idea of egalitarianism.

Carl Lehrburger is an environmental activist, renewable energy entrepreneur, researcher and author. He has studied archaeological and sacred sites in the Americas for over 25 years with a focus on the ancient peoples who came to the Americas long before Columbus. The culmination of his investigations is his book, Secrets of Ancient America, which is the topic of our discussion. Carl tells us about the true history of Columbus, one that reveals the conquistador knew exactly where he was going and what he would encounter based on a vast number of maps he possessed. He describes petroglyphs found in North America that place the Celts in New England several thousand years prior to Christ. These Ogham writings, found carved in stone on cave walls, address rituals around celestial days such Equinox and Solstice. Carl explains archaeoastronomy and diffusionism, controversial studies that have been the subject of much critique and discrediting. Then, he talks about many historical accounts that have been largely suppressed and contrived by the Archaeo Priests, evidence encoded in stone of our early European history that has been destroyed, and why the truth about our past is not being told. In the second half, we learn about the studies of famous diffusionist Thor Heyerdahl, whose most compelling work about the Americas has never been published in English. We discuss evidence of Old World groups living across North America that were wiped out by drought, and the remnants of European cultures that can be found in modern Native American tribes. Later, we consider motifs found in Native American culture that can be traced to the Indus Valley people. Further, Carl points to accounts of numerous maps uncovered in China and elsewhere that collectively prove the ancients had knowledge of the Americas and the rest of the globe, and also held superior technologies and capabilities. We end by considering evidence that humanity has in fact been in a state of decline for thousands of years.

Robert Davis is a professor of Italian Renaissance and pre-modern Mediterranean history at Ohio State University. He has published six books and is best known for his research that culminated in Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy. We begin our discussion with a look into the world of enslavement that is not commonly imparted in Western History. Robert tells about the Barbary Corsairs who ruled a slave industry during the same time of the Transatlantic slave trade. These pirates would capture ships from various European countries and enslave their predominately Christian crews. Robert explains the time frame of Columbus' voyage to the New World in 1492, and Barbarossa's systematic attack of the coast of Spain shortly thereafter, which supplied a vast amount of Spaniard slaves to the New World. We look at the small minority of slaves that actually made it to North America, and the millions of others that were captured and sold from Morocco to Libya and distributed throughout the New World, including the Caribbean and Brazil. Then, Robert describes the European industry of ransoming slaves, bringing about a huge wealth transfer from Europe to North Africa. He details the motives for capturing Christian slaves, the use of women as sex slaves, state owned ships powered by enslaved rowing galleys, and the conditions of slave life. Further, we discuss the US's involvement in the slave trade with the high stakes business of paying ransoms. Robert illustrates the stories of Christian slaves who were forced to convert to Islam by their captors, and vice versa. Robert also talks about the large number of slaves that were taken out of Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and other countries to the north of Africa. In conclusion, we discuss the changing nature of warfare in the Mediterranean and beyond, the decline of Christian slavery, and the lack of a definitive history of the slave trade beyond the US.

Octavian Grindean is a native Romanian who has been living in Sweden since 1989. Dealing with the challenges of leaving his homeland at the young age of 13, paired with an innate fascination with old history and mythology, Octavian had an early urge to know more about cultural differences between the east vs. the west. After awakening to the truth seeking path in 2004 and following a trip to Romania a few years later where he connected with his ancestors and history, Octavian set out on an intensive research on the subject of our identity, the identity crises that have arisen in many European countries, and the strong impact on the psyche that occurs when humans feel like they don’t belong anywhere. Octavian speaks about the lost history of Romania, one that does not have a lot of written detail prior to the Daco-Roman Wars and has been skewed since the Communist era. He tells about the rich and complex Dacian civilization, with roots steeped in advanced technology, agriculture and craftsmanship, and inhabited by a multitude of tribes extending throughout a vast territory. Octavian explains some of the ridiculous claims and conflicting accounts of the accepted history of the Romanization of Dacia. Then, he talks about the magnificent site of Sarmizegetuza Regia, the most important religious and spiritual capital of the Geto-Dacians, consisting of an enormous complex of at least 250 terraces, legends of an underground city, and a disputed, censored history. In the members’ hour, we discuss connections to the origins of current day issues of cultural erosion. Then, Octavian recounts some of the history behind Romania’s Ro?ia Montana, home of the most controversial mining project in the world and a fascinating gold chronicle. Later, we talk about the story of Vlad, a charismatic leader who overpowered the invading Ottoman Empire and whose true legend has been bashed out of existence by Hollywood’s Dracula and vampires. We wrap up with a look at Romania’s Christianization in the 3rd century and the Dacians’ refusal to recognize the Vatican.

Richard Spencer is President of The National Policy Institute and Editor of Washington Summit Publishers, Radix Journal, and RadixJournal.com. He was formerly an Assistant Editor at The American Conservative magazine and Executive Editor of Taki's Magazine. In 2010, he founded AlternativeRight.com, which he edited until 2012. He attended University of Virginia and University of Chicago and was a doctoral student at Duke University before dropping out to pursue a life of thought-crime. Richard joins us to discuss the world of multiculturalism, how the elites are moving us towards a monoculture, and what Americans and Europeans can do to encourage a more traditional culture that honors our Western roots. We talk about the march in Paris following the January 2015 shooting attacks, an event staged as a rally for free speech and led by leaders who are the farthest from advocating this liberty. Richard underlines some of the problematic policies that are promoting a perpetual state of culture clash in Europe. We consider the failure of the West to fully understand Islam but also discuss how defending Zionism is not our fight. Richard suggests reasons why Liberalism is inherently intolerant, and how we can embrace letting other cultures who do not hold our values live out their own destiny. Further, we speculate about the end of the Leftist era and the beginning of a spiritual awakening that could take us past the current negativity surrounding our existence. In the second half, Richard gives the background on NPI’s 2014 convention of nationalists, traditionalists and identitarians in Hungary that was partially botched by the country’s Prime Minister. He explains how the usual suspects issued backlash and criticism in the weeks leading up to the event, and how it was stereotypically billed by Western mainstream media as a racist, white supremacist gathering. Later, we get into the positive aspects of Pan-Europeanism and the negative consequences of Nationalism. We end by weighing up the contradictory forces that must be overcome in order to unite as a race with similar goals and ideals by fostering beauty, pride in heritage, and the strong character of the great people of the West.

Dr. Eric Karlstrom, emeritus Professor of Geography, California State University, Stanislaus, recently completed a 30-year teaching career. He taught physical and environmental geography courses, as well as courses cross-listed with the Geology department and an honors course. Throughout his career, Dr. Karlstrom has continued his research program in soils and geomorphology as means of reconstructing Quaternary paleoclimates. He is also the author or co-author of many earth science publications. Eric joins us to speak about his extensive research into an investigative series called, Is Crestone/Baca the "Vatican City of the New World Order?" An Expose of the New World Religion, which can be found on his website, 911 New World Order. Eric begins with a brief geographical sketch of the Crestone/Baca region, along with the reasons why he decided to delve into this inquiry. He talks about the radical contingent of environmentalists and Elites living in and connected to the area. He gives us a sketch of the key players in the UN's global property rights regulations, adopted as soft law by 179 nations in 1992-1993, including Maurice Strong, the man behind Agenda 21. Then, Eric talks about the New Age Religion movement that has jumped on the "sustainability" bandwagon, their use of psychological warfare as a means of promoting depopulation, and the arrogant, chauvinistic mindset of The Chosen Ones. We consider the corruption of culture by the Jewish Elites and their secret societies, New Age religions ruled by Ascended Masters, the use of occult magic, and the controversy of Zion and the system of the Kabbalah. In the second hour, we discuss the New World Order and the creation of a new society out of the ashes of chaos. Eric talks about dangers of Tibetan Buddhism, the perfect religion to transition into the coming government that will take advantage of the "blank mind" of collective consciousness. Further, we get into the corrupt environmental movement, the protocols of Zionism, the Elite "custodians of the planet," and geoengineering. We end with Eric's take on the new epidemic of gang stalking, a worldwide program of citizen spying, and reflect on the importance of preserving American culture.

Patrick Le Brun is a writer and activist who has written many articles for Counter-Currents. He has extensive experience with the French Identitarian movement. He is currently based in the United States, where he mentors college students who wish to engage in activism. Patrick joins us to give his unique perspective on the string of Paris shootings related to the Charlie Hebdo massacre. We begin with a look at some of the varied American alt media views on the events that transpired. We consider the Elite’s spin on the attacks used for their long term goals, with the general push that Mossad/Israel is behind the plot. Patrick spells out a number of details that would rule out Israeli involvement, and describes how Israeli false flags work. We talk about the history of the Kouachi brothers and Amedy Coulibaly, the many puzzling parts of their separate, violent sprees, the odd tactics of the police, and clues that the killers may have been linked to intelligence agencies. Patrick then explains the typical circumstances of young immigrants who turn to terrorism, the path of the Jihadist, and culture clash issues that are the result of a failed multicultural society. We look at what the conspiracies behind these events really could be, and shine a light on the rampant hypocrisy and sloppiness in government and police work. In the members’ section, Patrick gives a lesson on Jewish demographics and the Jewish destiny, underscoring the differences in Orthodox vs. Secular Jews, Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews, and the tremendous double standards that keep many of the sub-groups divided. Further, Patrick illustrates the rising tide of Jewish citizens leaving France and Europe, and how a new influx of Jews into Israel is what is needed to strengthen Israel’s rank. In conclusion, we talk about Marine Le Pen’s well-poised position as a centrist candidate for France’s upcoming election. We also reflect on the growing numbers of people turning towards alternative news and information sources.

Tom Goodrich has been a professional writer for the past thirty years. In addition to articles, blogs and movie scripts, Tom has written a dozen books. After serving in the US military during the Vietnam War, he traveled and lived abroad, including stops in Greece, Germany and Morocco. The author now lives on the Gulf Coast of Florida. Tom returns to Red Ice Radio to discuss his latest book, Scalp Dance: Indian Warfare on the High Plains, 1865-1879. This historical story, which draws greatly from diaries, letters and memoirs of American Plains settlers moving west after the Civil War, serves as a corrective account of a pivotal period that has been sensationalized and propagandized in Hollywood movie portrayals and in American Marxist Academia. Tom outlines some of the mantras about American Indians that have been hammered into the mass consciousness of Americans and used to perpetuate White guilt. Then, Tom talks about key points left out of the narrative, including the circle of violence and war that already existed amongst various tribes, and the fact that when it came to fighting the settlers, it wasn't always all White against all Red. We discuss the nature of rape amid the Indian people, and their use of bloody, sadistic torture that was considered the highest art form. Further, Tom details accounts of enslavement, rape and torture of captured White women, widely recognized as a fate worse than death. We look at this atrocious part of history that has been romanticized and skewed in trashy American novels and propaganda films. Tom explains why the White people were so furious with the Indians, carrying out atrocities that were retaliation for unimaginable crimes against them. In the second hour, we talk about the many sacrifices made by the European people in the creation of America. We consider the exploding population of new American immigrants, the general distrust and hatred for the current government, and the undeniable signs of a country at the precipice of collapse. We discuss Christian mantras such as "turn the other cheek" and "forgive and forget," which are in truth philosophies of slavery and tools for disassociation. Later, Tom tells us about the fine points of his upcoming book, Rape Hate, a cumulative piece that looks at the prevalence of rape in war, the undeclared war on women, pornography's spiritual massacre of women, and culture clashes that are exacerbating this radical plague. We conclude with some thoughts on the White people disease of paranoia, and reflect on the true history of progression.

Conrad from Gothenburg in Sweden joins us to speak about some of the numerous disturbing issues plaguing Swedish politics. He begins by sharing the awakening he experienced while researching the leftist ideas that shaped his previously accepted wisdom of this once noble country. In the process, Conrad stumbled upon many indications that the Swedish government was in fact committing cultural suicide, mainly through its investments in mass immigration and reckless altruism. We discuss the crumbling economy of Sweden, where there is no money to improve the services and infrastructure for its own citizens, but plenty of resources available to support what is now one of the largest welfare states in the world. Conrad outlines the main policies that are leading Sweden to decay, including the rights and benefits granted to immigrants and those who aid them, at the cost of the country's own identity. Furthermore, we look at the ideology of a melting pot, the predominate opposition to unrestrained welcoming of foreigners seeking asylum in Sweden and other countries, and the economic price that is paid to meet the demands of integration. Conrad goes on to summarize the extremist attitudes that are transforming the culture of Sweden, and the criticism faced by those who speak out against immigration policies. In the members' hour, we talk about the failure of Swedish politicians and journalists to portray the true economic state of the country, and the universalist view that is degrading culture worldwide. Then, we deliberate what looks like an active plan by the Elite to push a White privilege agenda and the propaganda that has penetrated society at large, creating a self-loathing White race. Later, Conrad gets into the real numbers of voters who support the controversial Swedish Democrat party, and what it will take to organize a proper opposition to current policies. At the end, we reflect on the true definition of genocide, the alteration of Sweden's Constitution, and incentivized methods for censorship.

Jay Dyer is a writer and researcher from the Southern US who obtained his BA in philosophy, while his graduate work focused on the interplay of literary theory, espionage and philosophy. His website, JaysAnalysis, is dedicated to investigating the deeper themes and messages found in our globalist pseudo culture, illustrating the connections between philosophy, metaphysics, secret societies, Hollywood, psychological warfare and comparative religion. In this special extended segment, Jay returns to Red Ice Radio in the wake of the attacks at Paris satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, and the numerous events surrounding this bizarre scenario, all of which bear tell-tale signs of a false flag. We take a look back at events in the recent past echoing similar patterns and relationships to the “War on Terror.” We consider the glaring fact that the US is funding and arming Islamist Al Qaeda in Syria, ISIS, Jihadists, etc. Jay describes some of the conflicting reports, discrepancies, and significant details that have been edited out of the media narrative, along with the big indicators of staged events. Then, we talk about Paris’ long history of suppressing free speech and the hypocrisy of the Charlie Hebdo publication. Jay explains how large terror events are psychological attacks on society that serve the interests of the Atlanticist establishment, where we inevitably hear the call for more militarization, surveillance, security, and policing, not just for the terrorists, but for all citizens. We look at the big picture of globalization, the creation of reactionary consumers, the erosion of family values, and a monoculture based around the new mythology of Hollywood. Additionally, we talk about the current anti-human, self-destructive, centralization-seeking regime, the true inclinations of human nature, and how to pull humanity out of its collective hypnosis. Later, Jay speaks about the confusing details of the Paris shootings and similar events and how the polarized media is involved in playing out a deep, psychological trick on the people in order to divert attention from the bigger picture. In conclusion, we speculate about where our dystopian, mediocre, monoculture is headed and contemplate the bright side of the transhumanist pipe dream.

Dr. Paul Edward Gottfried is an American paleoconservative political philosopher, intellectual historian, columnist and retired Horace Raffensperger Professor of Humanities at Elizabethtown College, as well as a Guggenheim recipient. He is the author of many books, including Conservatism in America, The Strange Death of Marxism, After Liberalism, Multiculturalism and the Politics of Guilt, and Leo Strauss and the Conservative Movement in America. Our discussion with Dr. Gottfried begins with an overview of the recent shooting massacre at Charlie Hebdo in France. We consider the ramifications of the growing Islam sect in Europe and the Neoconservative agenda that seems to have welcomed this brand of “terrorist” activity. Paul talks about the blending of the Left and Right, the push for multiculturalism, and the lack of any true opposition to the culture clash that is occurring between Islam and the West on European soil. Then, Paul explains the politics of guilt, tactics fueled by racism, social atomism, and the breaking down of traditionalist values while pushing the new religion of political correctness. We discuss how cultural Marxist social engineering is transforming Northern Europe and America by destroying any remnants of bourgeoisie, White, Christian society while at the same time controlling all forms of speech and thought. We look at the power structures of the elite, the manipulation of victim classes used to gain and maintain power, and the demonization of homogenous societies. In the second hour, we examine the big enabler, the state, and the various political parties, none of which seem to have any focus on preserving cultural values. Paul makes comparisons of the brainwashing and war on human nature that is occurring in the US and Europe and points out signs of the beginnings of change. Further, we talk about immigration rates, the assimilation of radical, hostile populations, and the reformation of democracy. Additionally, we consider the increasing emasculation of Western men, the priesthood of the managerial class, and the hierarchy of victims and victimizers. In the end, Paul shares some predictions for the fate of Western Civilization.

Dr. Matthew Buckley, PSc.D. entered the health care field largely to understand and resolve his personal struggles with chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia which began late in his teens. His ongoing study of functional medicine, nutrition, nutrigenomics, applied kinesiology, and energetic medicine has provided him with keen insight and understanding into the holistic dynamics of the body and how we lose and maintain our health. He has maintained a busy practice in Austin, Texas for the past 13 years and works with people of all ages interested in maximizing their health, and overcoming the modern scourge of all forms of chronic illness. We’ll discuss how all disease begins in the gut. The gut serves as approximately 70% of the immune system. It plays a significant role in not only our immune function, but also to our mental/emotional status according to a great deal of scientific research. Matthew explains how Monsanto’s product called Roundup contains a chemical called glyphosate, which is disrupting our microbiome. This disruption of our microbiome can result in an overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, which triggers immune response, and this immune response would then trigger the brains immune cells, the microglia, to become overly active and degrade brain cells. He’ll describe this process, what amplifies it and what health consequences arise from it. Also, we address the issue of eating genetically modified organisms and the damage that arises from consuming them. Matthew talks about the politics of Monsanto and what we can do to stop the madness. Later on, Matthew talks about parasites, the creepy epidemic that is here now.

Tim Murdock is the host of White Rabbit Radio and the voice of Horus the Avenger. He has also produced the popular animations “How The Whites Took Over America,” “Anti-Racist Hitler,” and “Johnny Racist.” Tim has been a guest on Radio 3Fourteen and now joins us at Red Ice Radio to discuss some of the most popular themes and memes currently circulating and gaining momentum in the mainstream. Tim begins by laying out the War of Deception that has been waged by the Elites and explains how memes are used to shape the perceptions of the masses. He talks about the speed and frequency these ideas are being introduced into society and speculates on the possibilities of the larger scenario involving the New World Order. We look at the Ancient Alien and Out of Egypt memes that have saturated network television and the expensive mockumentary productions that are being used to test the boundaries of intelligent viewers. Then, Tim describes the keystone agenda of White Genocide, one of the largest PSYOP schemes to ever take hold of humanity at such an alarming rate, and the rising popularity of the idea that Whites are not indigenous to Earth. Further, we examine the issues of new human rights laws designed to protect everyone except Whites, mass immigration, and the forced blending of Whites. In hour two we assess the changing landscape of Europe due to forced multiculturalism, the dramatic moves being made by the Neocon set, and the phasing out of Zionism. Tim explains the tactics the Elites are using to regain the respect of the Managerial Class. Later, Tim brings light to the huge con of Diversity and illustrates how Whites are waking up to this crazy scenario. We end by looking at the big problems being faced by Western Media and the White Rabbit’s goal of amplifying, bringing awareness to, and combating this psychological warfare.

Laird Scranton is an independent software designer who became interested in Dogon mythology and symbolism in the early 1990s. He has studied ancient myth, language, and cosmology since 97. He has been a featured speaker at national conferences on ancient mysteries, including the Paradigm Symposium. He is the author of several books, including The Science of the Dogon and China’s Cosmological Prehistory. Laird joins us to speak about his research on the magnificent site of Skara Brae on Orkney Island in Northern Scotland, a Neolithic farming settlement that is thought to date back prior to both Stonehenge and the Great Pyramids. These findings tie in to the subject of his new book, Point of Origin, which points to Gobekli Tepe as a center of civilizing knowledge for the ancient world. He outlines the history of the Skara Brae site, which was covered over until the 1850s. Laird details the layout of the village and temple found at Skara Brae, a megalithic site that appears to be linked to a cosmological blueprint for instructional sanctuaries used by multiple ancient cultures around the globe. In the second hour, Laird explains what is believed to be the purpose of the site and discusses how the myths and deities of Skara Brae connect linguistically to the early agricultural kingships in Egypt, China, the British Isles, and South America. Then, we look at the differences between Mother Goddess cultures and Creator God cultures, and consider the parallels of prevalent ancient myths. In conclusion, we delve into the possible explanations for the covering of ancient villages and megalithic sites, and what these sites may represent in the progressive stages of creation.

Fredrik Andersson is the founder and writer of the Swedish Surveyor blog, a forum for scrutinizing the politically correct madness for the masses in Sweden. He has lived abroad and has resided in Sweden since adolescence, where he has witnessed the massive transformation the country has been going through over the past 30 years. Upon waking up to the radical ostracization of the Sweden democrats and numerous controversial and political issues in Sweden, Fredrik changed his views about the country and set out to expose politicians and other public figures in Sweden through his blog. Fredrik joins us today to speak about some of the most troubling issues in Sweden. We begin with a look at the population replacement level of immigration occurring, the ethnocentrically charged environment triggered by those seeking asylum in the country, and the ethnic identification that is being bred out of the native Swede. Fredrik points out how integration has failed and the culture has been eroded due to the double standards of the government. We discuss how it has become acceptable to hate the Swedish Democrats, who are often accused of being Nazis, racists, Islamophobes, Fascists, etc. Then, we consider the migration industry, the money involved, and who is profiting. In the second hour, Fredrik explains the recent amendment of the Swedish constitution that allows the censorship and suppression of publically expressed opinions on the internet. Further, we talk about the rape epidemic and the rise in violent crimes that are occurring in asylum homes and nearby communities. Later, we analyze the identity crisis of many European countries and the more radical form of Islam that is widely taking hold. In the end, we talk about ISIS sleeper cells arriving as refugees, the reason why Sweden is the country in the EU with the most Jihadists per capita, and the generous welfare benefits immigrants receive. We close with some thoughts on the EU’s hidden agenda and the rise of Nationalist parties in Europe.

Patrick Henningsen is the founder and managing editor of 21st Century Wire, an independent virtual journal that delivers news and exposés on intelligence, foreign policy, climate change, the war on terror, technology and Wall Street. Patrick has been a regular guest on the program and joins us again today to discuss the Ferguson fiasco and some of the surrounding issues concerning race, individuality, destruction of culture, and what the end game plan is for the technocrats as they bring in more control by conjuring up more chaos with the aid of willing accomplices and naïve, good intended people. We consider how modern activism is motivated by the influence of social media and the dangerous divide that is being created in America through the weaponization of political correctness. Patrick analyzes the compulsive behavior displayed by politicians who use crisis situations as a way to grab as much political capital as possible. We look at the fallacies of mob mentality, mob justice and inherent white privilege. Then, Patrick talks about how Americans are becoming increasingly class conscious and narcissistic while at the same time falling into the traps of political activist groups that are essentially promoting a war on human nature with their collectivist agenda. In the members’ hour, we reflect on the militarization and mechanization of the police force and situations like the Eric Garner incident that fuel the frenzy of the Hegelian dialectic. We also ponder the rapid homogenization of culture, ethnic erosion, and white guilt. Later, we’ll compare the similar views and goals of the left and the right as well as deliberate the evolution of class and gender warfare, our oligarchic rulers, and the wide acceptance of inherited wealth and fame. In closing, Patrick shares his views on the crab mentality of egalitarianism.

His website, JaysAnalysis, is dedicated to investigating the deeper themes and messages found in our globalist pseudo culture, illustrating the connections between philosophy, metaphysics, secret societies, Hollywood, psychological warfare and comparative religion. Our discussion begins with a focus on mass media’s use of psychological warfare to indoctrinate world views on our culture as a whole. Jay explains how philosophies can be engineered and used as forms of PSYOP, a trap of empiricism that ultimately leads to false presuppositions. Then, we discuss hidden metaphysics, the suppression of prominent thinkers, and the western elite’s technological techniques of dialectics that are used to destroy the arts. Further, we consider the esoteric approach of linguistics, the school of pragmatism, and the new prophets of modernity, Marx, Freud and Darwin. In the second hour, Jay gets into the power of the entertainment industry, the new mythology of Hollywood, and pop culture’s deconstruction, control and subversion of reality. We talk about the iconography of films such as Independence Day, A.I., Interstellar, the James Bond series, and more. Later, Jay describes the use of archetypes in movies and the socially engineered subversion that is taking advantage of and manipulating the fears of society. Lastly, we chew over the current themes circulating in the mainstream, many of which tout the fraud of “diversity” and forced multiculturalism.

John Lash has been a regular guest on Red Ice Radio since 2008, sharing the discoveries of his collective studies in the fields of directive and sidereal mythology, naked-eye astronomy, precession, the World Ages, belief systems, and his radical revision of Gnosticism. He has also delved deeply into the sacred story of Gaia-Sophia and introduced the term Archon to the discourse of humanity. Mr. Lash returns to the program to announce the formation of the Kalika War Party, a band of self-selected men and women volunteers whose goal is “to strike offensively against all variations of the evil and corrupt system that works against life, truth, freedom, beauty, sanity, and the spirit of mutual aid.” John explains how his exploration of the Parsifal myth and the Holy Grail question, “What ails thee?” led him to conceive of the KWP entity. We consider the wounded species of humanity and the suffering caused by the psychopaths who are leading our world to demise. Then, John describes how the use of magic and shamanism will shape the operations of the KWP, and reminds us of the true abilities of the shaman, which can be to heal as well as eliminate. Later, John gets into the social evils of mind control, the domestication and pacification of humanity in the name of Christianity, the elite’s control of the narrative, and the gruesome, murderous, destructive attacks that have been carried out by the USA and those who control it, against all living beings and the earth itself. Then, John talks about the meaning of the Thunderbird Formation, the symbol for the KWP, and the reemergence of the Warrior Class. At the end, we examine the true violent tendencies of man, the popularity of war games, and the inevitable downfall of feminism.

Frank DeSilva is the author of many articles, books, essays and poetry, which have accrued over a lifetime of intense searching, challenging the great Ideas of Politics, Philosophy, History, Social Science, and matters of race. His search for Truth has known no limits, and has often taken him into areas of life that few have traveled. We’ll discuss his belief that Race describes a unique and important aspect of the human species, and that each ethnic group must, at all costs, liberate themselves from that pernicious melding of the modern’s view of Globalism, which would deny all distinct life-forms from existing on the planet, turning true Diversity into that of the equality of the slave. Mr. DeSilva sees all these biological beings as being part of a greater spirituality, and the Metaphysics of ‘blood’ are a consistent and dominant theme throughout this interview. In this special 2 hour interview, we’ll explore concepts relating to folk consciousness, race culture, and the spirituality of race. We also discuss how modern thinking has led Western men and women down a divergent path. Now we have a culture developing beside our true one that is not based on nature. Then, we delve into Frank’s book Foundations for the 21st Century, a work designed to introduce the novice to the world of Ethno-Nationalism, that is, the Truth regarding Race as the primary force behind the forming of Nations and Political States. Frank shares his thoughts on what is important in the future folk state. Later, we discuss the notion of high culture and natural aristocracy among men and women. Frank closes with advice for younger generations.

Colin Liddell and Andy Nowicki are co-editors and writers of Alternative Right, an online magazine of radical traditionalism with a stimulating, hilarious spin. In addition to their blog, both men are regular contributors at several other online publications, Colin has held various positions in journalism and education, and Andy is the author of eight published novels. We’ll discuss some of the major themes of their writings, many of which question, from different points of view, the ideas that are forced upon society by the extreme left. Colin and Andy share their viewpoints about the problems with egalitarianism and the rejection of science, nature and biology by the Establishment. We take a look at the diminishment of humanism by the forces of modernity in the name of economic growth, one of the key concepts behind the Alt Right movement. Then, we consider the general loss of control and blind coherence that occurs with exponential progress fueled by ego. In the member’s hour, Andy and Colin talk about the importance of encouraging art and literature that challenges the mainstream issues and shows the movement to the masses while avoiding didacticism. Further, we discuss the constant suppression of anything that may offend the masses, a sort of de facto Fascism played out against those with a provocative message. In conclusion, we analyze the waning of America’s global power and the US involvement with the proxy war in Ukraine against Russia.

Joaquin Flores is an American expat living in Belgrade. He is a full-time analyst at the Center for Syncretic Studies, a public geostrategic think-tank, where his work centers on Eastern European, Eurasian, and Middle East affairs. Flores is particularly adept at analyzing the psychology of the propaganda wars and cutting through the noise of 'information overload.' He also serves as the Europe-wide coordinator for New Resistance, a US based revolutionary movement. In the first hour, Joaquin explains the impetus for the founding of the Center for Syncretic Studies, formed in 2013 as platform from which to view the various social and ideological movements that exist today with a broad lens. We discuss the commonality between the radical and progressive left and the radical and paleo-conservative right, which hold the same values and also see the same things wrong with society. Then, Joaquin breaks down the divide and conquer tactics of our leaders, the dictatorship that exists within the US, and the importance of waking up to the delusion that there will be a government reform. In the second hour we consider what it is that can be done by the people in the USA to overcome the dilemmas of Government. Joaquin gives some insight into commonly held criticisms of the Powers That Be, the US’s misinterpretation of revolutions around the globe, and the importance of getting past the idea that the mainstream view is the majority. Then, we examine the propaganda surrounding multiculturalism and the deracination that is occurring within European cultures. Later, Joaquin talks about the media war that is occurring within the Ukraine and Russia, Operation: Gladio, and the New Inter Nationalists. Further, we deliberate the Ukrainian Civil War, US involvement with Pravy Sektor Coup, the push for a Ukrainian failed state, and the role of Islam in this artificially created social movement. In conclusion, Joaquin describes how The New Media is the primary weapon in 4th generation warfare.

Martin Biddle is a British archaeologist and academic whose excavation and recording techniques have revolutionized the field. He is an Emeritus Fellow of Hertford College, Oxford, and Honorary Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, as well as Archaeological Consultant for Canterbury Cathedral and St. Albans Cathedral and Chairman of the Fabric Advisory Committee of Winchester Cathedral. Professor Biddle joins us today to speak about exciting evidence of Vikings found at an excavation in Repton, England. Martin starts with a brief history of some of his most treasured projects in England, where he began his career in the 50s. He then describes the dig at Repton, which began in the summer of 1974 as a study of the structure of the Anglo-Saxon Church of St Wystan and an investigation of some odd stories of discoveries in the garden of Vicarage near the church. The church stands on an Anglo-Saxon crypt and is one of the most important sites to survive in England from before the Norman Conquest. At this location Martin and his late wife, Birthe, unearthed the remains of the Viking Great Army that had overwintered there in 873-4. Martin goes into detail about the many extraordinary finds at Repton, including a massive warrior burial mound, Viking tools, a central coffin containing what is believed to be the remains of Ivar the Boneless, and the bones of a giant skeleton. Then, Martin illustrates the historical significance of the findings at Repton, a quintessentially English place that was the backdrop for momentous social and religious change in the 8th and 9th centuries. We conclude with an overview of the next stage for the Repton project.

Laurence Easeman is a long time researcher, filmmaker and anti-usury social justice campaigner. He is an activist for Monetary Reform and Land Reform through the abolition of Usury, the creation of Interest-Free Credit and a contemporary system of Tribal Anarchy. At the core of Laurence's work is a struggle against the cabal of Private International Bankers that have a monopoly over our money supply. He believes that if we are to experience any real sense of freedom then we must find solutions to that monopoly, because banking is nothing more than institutionalized usury. We begin by discussing Laurence’s timeline and how he became interested in understanding the hidden mechanisms of banking and money. He describes how once he uncovered the truth behind the fraudulent mortgage industry, a mega-scam essential to the enslavement of the Western population. He decided to test his personal power and challenge an eviction notice issued by the bank carrying his home mortgage, bringing him considerable media attention. Laurence explains how at this time he was inspired by the Dennis Wise documentary The Greatest Story Never Told, which led him to produce the now viral YouTube video entitled The People vs. The Banks. Then, Laurence discusses his recent appearance in the headlines when a smear campaign was launched against him following a botched panel discussion with Russell Brand. Later, Laurence shares his views on what he calls “Revolution Light,” a trap of the Marxists that is restraining the people from forming any true sense of a revolution because any form of openly questioning the constructs and speaking out is so quickly demonized. We wrap up with Laurence sharing some thoughts on the global elitists’ agenda of pushing mass immigration to a crisis point, causing the destabilization of the west and the breeding out of native European peoples.

Robert Ferguson is an author from the United Kingdom, where he completed the Scandinavian Studies program at University College, London, specializing in Norwegian. He eventually emigrated to Norway where he began his literary career as a radio dramatist, writing eleven original radio plays and going on to write several biographies, two histories of the Vikings, and two novels. Robert joins us to speak primarily about the topic of his latest book, The Hammer and the Cross: The New History of the Vikings. We begin our discussion with a look back to when the Viking era began, which coincides with the rise of the Charlemagne Empire and the forcible conversion of the Saxons to Christianity in the late Iron Age. Robert explains how the Scandinavians revolted when Christianity began to take hold in Northern Europe and the Heathen culture was being annihilated, resulting in the outbreak of the Viking Era. Then, Robert talks about the conversion to Christianity, an accepted modernization process that took advantage of the lack of dogma and unifying word of worship in Heathenism, leading to the control and institutionalization of Pagans. In the second hour, we consider the most trusted sources for Viking Age history, the etymology of Viking place names, and the oral history that defined these peoples. Robert elaborates on the societal changes that occurred with written law and the recording of history. In conclusion, we reflect on the rich culture of Heathenism with its history of violence, strength and honor. We also speculate about the location of the great Heathen temple, which was destroyed in 1080, marking the beginning of the end of the Viking Age.

He explains how allergies are on the rise and why people tend to suffer more in modern times. Then, Christopher describes the mechanisms of herbal remedies and gives us many examples of herbs that are most beneficial for treating different organs and tissues in the body. He goes on to tell us how fasting works to rid the body of toxins and the many reasons why toxins accumulate. We also discuss eating habits, environmental toxins and the various maladies that are caused by lifestyle. In the second hour, Christopher talks about the stress factor and the importance of de-stressing. He then outlines the topics of some of his latest books, including The Water Prescription, The Acid Alkaline Diet, The Detox Mono Diet, Optimal Detox, and The Secret of The Blood.

Sofia Smallstorm is best known for her research on 9/11, which culminated in the documentary 9/11 Mysteries. She is also known for her analysis of chemtrails. We’ll discuss the tools being used to create humanity 2.0. It would appear there is an agenda to synthetically re-engineer humanity, both physically and mentally. We’ll talk about what some of these aspects the elite would find useful to change may be and how it can be done. How far might this go? Sofia talks about the attributes that seem to be emerging in humanity 2.0. Also, we discuss the secular humanist, transhumanist movement or techno-progressivism that seeks to make man superior but “equal” across the globe. As Earthlings are bombarded with an onslaught of synthetic elements, we’ll discuss how we can remain relatively untouched. Will we see a separation between humanity 1.0 and humanity 2.0? Will we be able to reverse the damage that may occur?

Kerry Bolton has certifications and doctorates in theology, social work studies, psychology, and Ph.D. honoris causa. He is widely published by the scholarly and broader media with numerous pamphlets, articles and books on topics ranging from world history, politics and banking to ethnicity, metaphysics, religion and the occult. Bolton joins us to speak primarily about his book, The Psychotic Left: From Jacobin France to the Occupy Movement. Kerry begins by telling us his motivation behind tackling this subject, which stems from decades of his observations of accusations of the psychotic nature of the rights and conservatives. He goes on to explain how Western culture has been shaped by many Marxist based studies of “normal society,” in which normal values have been identified with psychotic behavior. We discuss the common threads of the guiding forces behind left wing movements, which can be deduced to big money paired with narcissistic, sociopathic, paranoid personalities. Kerry talks about the Bolshevik and French Revolutions, both revolts against civilization that were surprisingly not led by the downtrodden, but rather the Bourgeoisie and capitalists. We go on to discuss the self-destructive and poor decision making tendencies of highly intelligent people. Later, we explore Politicized Psychiatry and Freudianism’s tie to Marxism. In the second hour we deliberate multiculturalism in Europe, political correctness, and the systematic programming of the White race. Kerry then goes on to explain how the Western World is experiencing an organic cycle of decline. Then, we discuss how the emotional subjects of race, religion and class are being used to divert our attention away from the real problems of usury and capitalism. We finish with some thoughts on the control social media outlets and Google has over youthful social movements.

Mike King is a private investigative journalist and researcher based in the New York City area. A 1987 graduate of Rutgers University, King's subsequent 27 year career in Marketing & Advertising has equipped him with a unique perspective when it comes to understanding how "public opinion" is indeed scientifically manufactured. He is back with us to talk about how the Ferguson situation is being used to further the agenda of the elites. We begin by discussing how the momentum of this case was fueled by many details being concealed from the general public along with an orchestrated announcement of the grand jury’s decision to waive an indictment. Mike explains how Al Sharpton’s involvement in the White House is a classic example of “good cop/bad cop” working towards triggering a nationwide uprising that will serve as a pretext for a crackdown by the Department of Homeland Security. Then, we take a look at how media attention of the Ferguson riots has completely overshadowed Obama’s recent decision to grant broad-based amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, a very damaging move that will inevitably lead to increased mass immigration. Also, Mike talks about the microcosm of California, the problems of multiculturalism and the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s efforts to ensure diversity is distributed equally across US communities. Further, we examine how Political Correctness is now the New Religion along with the double standards surrounding our freedom of speech. In the second hour, we shift gears as we go over Mike’s article called “Hitler in Argentina Hoax,” where he takes a closer look at the evidence presented for the case that Hitler escaped the bunker in Berlin and got away to South America. We discuss the hoax industry that has popped up around WWII, the Nazi’s and Hitler, in which many theories are based on a handful of ambiguous statements by third parties and with no real substantiated evidence. We end by considering the reasons behind why most journalists refuse to touch the WWII/Holocaust subject.

Mark Hackard is an independent foreign policy analyst. He earned a BA in Russian Language from Georgetown University and an MA in Russian, Eastern European and Eurasian Studies from Stanford University. Mark’s online project The Soul of the East is to ensure the valuable aspects of Russian political and religious thought are made available to English speakers. We’ll discuss the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky and his encounters with liberalism, socialism and revolution. Mark tells about Dostoevsky’s time in Petrashevsky Circle, followed by his experience in a Siberian prison camp, and then his stance after his release from exile. We switch focus to discuss the novel Demons, which Mark calls Dostoevsky's great counter-revolutionary novel where he portrays ideas and ideological foundations as demonic. Further, we discuss dialectics and the strategy of tension. We’ll discuss how the dialectic is used by revolutionaries to drive society in a specific direction. Mark points out that Dostoevsky’s novels were prophetic. Mark describes how liberalism leads to tyranny, pondering the thoughts of Plato who described how democracy leads to tyranny. Later, we’ll contemplate Dostoevsky and Nietzsche’s concepts of a Superman or Übermensch. Moving on, we’ll discuss how the west has embraced disembodied distractions and as Dostoevsky would say, the plan is to turn us into an obedient herd of sub-humans. We end on the American experiment and weaponized ideologies currently in action, invented by the elite for control purposes.

We’ll also talk about false claims against parents that result in children being wrongfully taken away. We’ll also discuss the foster care system where children are more likely to be abused. Later, Carlos says what families should do to protect themselves from this monolithic agency that has destroyed the lives of children & parents. In the second hour, he’ll discuss more about the system, including the quality of people that are employed by CPS. Later, we’ll talk about the direction of society. Where is it heading? Is it best to wait for things to fall apart or what is the strategy to enact change?

Anthony Migchels is an Interest-Free Currency activist and founder of the Gelre, the first Regional Currency in the Netherlands. He joins us to talk about the very central problems of economics today, usury or interest, alternative currencies and more. We begin by discussing the problems with our global usury economy, which results in the rich owning the majority of the wealth – a scheme that will inevitably lead to an economic collapse. Anthony explains how the money powers that be have plans spanning centuries and this predatory system, disguised as a free market strategy, is backed by the extremes of Libertarianism and Marxism, philosophies that contradict the very nature of mankind. We’ll also take a look at how the workforce produces the majority of the wealth for the rich, yet their wages, food and basic commodities are taxed, resulting in total slavery to the state. Then, Anthony talks about the monetary reform movement, which is concerned with the creation of money out of nothing, as opposed to the problem of usury. In the second hour, we discuss the shift of power and the crunch to destroy the west that occurred when the U.S. exported its entire manufacturing base to China. We’ll also talk about capitalism, mass immigration, feminism and the destruction of the nuclear family, and the degradation of the brotherhood of men. Then, we’ll consider the implications of revisionist history concerning WWII and the Jewish banking system’s involvement. Anthony then discusses the Euro-crisis and the inevitable crash of the global economy. We’ll wrap up with some reflections on possibilities of a mass awakening and the improvement of living standards.

Neil Kramer is a British philosopher and esotericist. His work focuses chiefly on spirituality, metaphysics, mysticism, freedom, and inner development. He returns to discuss the differences between imperial culture and organic human culture, which is rooted in spiritual mortality and a relationship with the land. Neil elaborates on how imperial culture functions, what it requires of its citizens and how it ultimately keeps people ignorant. We’ll also discuss complex ignorance vs. self awareness. Then, Neil explains how the masses have been confused and conditioned by self censoring thought patterns such as political correctness, within imperial culture. We’ll continue on the importance of understanding our tribal heritage. Without it our identity and inner development is impeded. Also, Neil explains how the belief that we are all one and the same, is death. He’ll talk about what empire gains from sameness. Later, we discuss why it’s crucial to maintain our tribal mythologies. In the second hour, we discuss the importance of community. We’ll also talk about massive population growth and the resources needed to sustain the population. Neil brings forth the idea of “mindful reproduction.” Later, we talk about how empire is constantly growing without an end in sight, always seeking to become more but throughout time glorious cataclysms have set things back into place. Neil discusses nature’s regular purification process on the planet. At the end, we speak about the preparation for self-governance, for what will come when the empire begins to crumble.

Ali Aliabadi, of Iranian origin is the author of the essay called On Martial Arts, Zen, and the Blue-Eyed, Red-Bearded Barbarian. He has a science background, is obsessed with classical music and loves to mountain bike. Like in his essay, Ali draws together considerable evidence that the founder of Buddhism, martial arts and the Zen philosophy, did indeed lay with an Indo-European-descended wanderer into the Far East. He’ll tell us about Bodhidharma, the blue-eyed, red-bearded barbarian who had tremendous influence over the Orient. We’ll also discuss the link between Europeans and Ancient China as Caucasians roamed China’s Tarim Basin 1000 years before East Asians. Ali talks about how “red bearded barbarian” was a common monikor for foreign monks who proselytized Buddhism among the Chinese. We’ll talk about modern depictions of Buddha as Mongoloid vs. the more ancient sources that depict him with Nordic features. We cover many subjects from the swastika, to Aryans, Nordic warriors, martial arts, Zen meditation and much more. Later, Ali addresses the ugliness of political correctness, which is oozing into archeology, history and into the minds of Europeans in attempts to destroy a successful breed of people. In the past conquerors destroyed the cultures of their defeated but today the conquerors use social psychology and the technique they use is to tell the particular nation that they have nothing to be proud of.

Daniel Hammarberg writes news and debate articles and has worked with the anti-pedophile movement Nätverket stoppa pedofilerna. Daniel has also competed in strongman events where he's pulled trucks, flipped tractor tires and lifted logs overhead. We’ll begin discussing how he became a pariah in Swedish society after public authorities received word of him being a “racist.” He’ll talk about the damage created by the Moderate Party in Sweden. Then, we’ll discuss how mass immigration and liberal policies have led to high crime and ghettos in peaceful Sweden. Also, he explains how Sweden continues to deconstruct the male gender in Sweden and its negative effects on society. In the second hour, Daniel explains what Sweden and the Soviet Union have in common. We’ll also discuss how the Swedish social services system is never accountable as many children have committed suicide while in their care. He’ll speak more about the destruction of gender roles and the crusade to wipe out any shred of masculinity. Later, Daniel tells what happened when an animal welfare investigator came to his home to check on his cats. At the end, he leaves closing words to men to reawaken the traditional, primordial man.

http://www.redicecreations.com/radio3fourteen/2014/R314-141105.php

Stephen Harrod Buhner is the author of 19 books, including Plant Intelligence and the Imaginal Realm, The Lost Language of Plants and Sacred Plant Medicine. He is the senior researcher for the Foundation for Gaian Studies and has taught for more than 30 years throughout North America and Europe. We’ll discuss James Lovelock’s theory that our planet is a self regulating biological entity, which is known as the Gaia Hypothesis. Also, we discuss the relationship between humans and bacteria, humans and plants and the patterns that connect us. Stephen tells why he disagrees with the notion that humans are a plague on the planet. He also talks about the function of what we think are invasive plants and weeds. Then, Buhner shares a different opinion on environmentalism and how it relates to plant intelligence. Later, we discuss what state of perception is necessary for interacting with plants. We’ll also talk about hallucinogenic plants and the idea that humans should be partaking what is native to their homeland.

Jason Erb has been writing for his blog, Exposing Faux Capitalism, since the start of the global financial collapse of 2008 and has been hosting his own weekly radio show since 2012. Jason covers economic, financial and political issues from a unique and uncompromisingly fact-based perspective. In the first hour, we’ll talk about the Ottawa shooting when Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, an Islam convert fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian soldier and then launched an attack in the nearby Centre Block parliament building. Jason talks about Canadian-Islamic relations and what may arise from this event. Will it lead to increased support for Israel? Then, we’ll talk about diminished free speech in Canada, including Arthur Topham’s case. In the second hour, we’ll discuss mass immigration into Canada and the barrage on European-Canadian heritage. Canada’s intake of immigrants is the highest per capita in the world. Jason speaks about Canada’s rapid change in demographics and comments on what will happen if this continues. He’ll talk about Canada’s founding settlers who were diverse with European culture from the start. Also, Jason tells how a rapid demographic change in Canada is changing what history Canadian students are being taught. He’ll also talk about special provisions for natives that are discriminatory to White Canadians. Later, Jason gives his take on Jewish influence in finance and economics and comments on the statements made by Karen Hudes.

Canadian born Arthur Topham has a background in Political Science and Education. Since 1999 he has been the Writer, Journalist, Publisher & Editor of RadicalPress.com. Due to the fact that the website has been sabotaged on a number of occasions over the years the information on it only goes back to June of 2006. Arthur will talk about the pressures of Jewish lobbyists in Canada to remove his site, specifically B'nai Brith Canada. Its materials posted sparked two attacks from the lobbyists, the first occurring in 2007 when he was charged with a sec. 13(1) "hate crime" under the legislation contained in Canada's Human Rights Code. The second attack occurred in 2012 when he was charged under the Canadian Criminal Code, sec. 319(2) "Hate Propaganda" legislation with "willfully promoting hatred against an identifiable group, people of the Jewish religion or ethnic origin." He’ll talk about these charges, his arrest and the upcoming trial before the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Arthur discusses the history of such “hate propaganda” laws in Canada and how they came about. He’ll also talk about the former sec. 13 legislation which was used by the lobby groups for decades to stifle criticism of Israel and discussion concerning anything related to Zionism both on and off the internet. In the second hour, we’ll speak more about forced Zionist agendas in Europe, replacement level migration in the west, anti-Europhobia and why people, wherever they are on the political spectrum, should be concerned that freedom of speech and freedom of the press is threatened in Canada.

Greg Johnson is the editor-in-Chief of Counter Currents Publishing and its journal and webzine North American New Right. He is the author of Confessions of a Reluctant Hater and also New Right vs. Old Right. We’ll discuss the condensed message of the New North American Right. Greg interprets the differences between the New Right, the Old Right and the New Left. He shares his vision of European ethno metapolitics and distinguishes it from Fascism and National Socialism. What is ethno-nationalism and how can it enable peace for everyone? He’ll tell why he focuses on metapolitics and compares it to occult warfare. We’ll also ask the question that people avoid, “Is human inequality such a bad thing?” Later, he explains why he strongly opposes the claim that Europeans have brought genocide upon themselves. He also sets out some basic principles for creating a growing, resilient, networked movement of fellow Europeans who share pan-secessionist goals. At the end, we’ll discuss a chapter from Greg’s book called The Perils of Positive Thinking. He explains why positive thinking ultimately cannot save Europeans from the state they’re in.

Brian Hooker has had a distinguished career as a chemical engineer, managing a large-scale systems biology research program at Batelle/Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington. Since 1995, he has served that laboratory as a senior research engineer, a staff engineer, and a principle consultant in biotechnology. He also taught chemical engineering for three years at Tri-State University in Indiana and teaches at Walla Walla Community College in Washington in addition to operating his own consulting agency. He has a long list of research grants, scholarly/technical publications, awards, and formal presentations, and is co-owner of several patents. Dr Hooker reveals his relationship to the whistleblower, a top researcher employed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) who came forward, confessing to his participation in actively covering up data that clearly links vaccines to autism. Dr. Hooker is the father of a vaccine-injured child, and is a Ph.D. researcher. He has fought against the CDC for more than 12 years, using the Freedom of Information Act to try and gather as much data as he could from the studies that the CDC has published that claim there is no link between vaccines and autism. He’ll talk about what he discovered when the CDC finally handed over documents so that he could look at the raw data that the CDC used to claim that there was no link between vaccines and autism. He’ll talk about the science behind the study, government corruption and spending, his struggle and what the public isn’t told. Later, we’ll talk about the pressure to get people vaccinated. Brian also shares his own story of an autistic son and the process to help him.

Roger Stone, The New York Times bestselling author of The Man Who Killed Kennedy the Case Against LBJ, gives the inside scoop on Nixon’s rise and fall in Watergate as we discuss his latest book “Nixon’s Secrets: The Rise, Fall, and Untold Truth about the President, Watergate, and the Pardon.” Stone was the youngest member of the Nixon staff in 1972 and worked closely with Nixon on his rehabilitation in his post-presidential years. Stone has been a Washington insider for the last 40 years and played a key role in the election of Republican presidents Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Roger argues that just as the assassination of JFK prevents a balanced analysis of Kennedy and his times, the myth of Watergate prevents a reappraisal of the 37th President. Roger reveals how the Kennedy’s wiretapped Nixon’s hotel room and stole Nixon's medical records. He outlines how White House Counsel John Dean, planned, pushed and covered-up the Watergate break-in, then sought to avoid responsibility for it. Stone tells us about the bungled Watergate break-in to determine what exactly Nixon’s agents were looking for and how the CIA infiltrated the burglar team and sabotaged the break-in to gain leverage over Nixon. In the second hour, we discuss the JFK assassination as one event in a series of corrupt events. Also, we’ll talk about the upcoming 2016 election and the chances of putting a Libertarian Party candidate on the ballot. Stone tells us how the Republicans and Democrats are turning into the same party.

He’ll also give his view on fighting the political system. Then, we’ll discuss how parents have become an enforcer for school, changing the dynamics of the parent/child relationship. Brett also talks about the 6 pillars of self-esteem. We’ll move on to talk about the power of pop culture and whether parents should shield their children from the programming. At the end of the hour, Brett gives advice for people who want to drop out of school.

Tracy R. Twyman is an American non-fiction author, born in Kansas City, Missouri. She writes about esoteric history. She is probably best known for her books The Merovingian Mythos and Solomon’s Treasure. In recent years she has pioneered what she calls "Alchenomics," the study of the relationship between alchemy, economics, and the evolution of money through the ages, which culminated in her book Money Grows on the Tree of Knowledge. Before writing books, she made a name for herself as the Editor and Publisher of a highly unique underground cult magazine entitled Dagobert’s Revenge, published from 1996 to 2003. Tracy returns to the program to talk about her latest book Clock Shavings. She’ll tell of a Ouija board investigation that started with the aim of contacting dead French artist Jean Cocteau in order to glean clues about the secrets of the Priory of Sion and the grail bloodline. The brethren of Tracy’s occult order Ordo Lapsit Exillis ended up getting in contact with demons from beyond the veil who claimed to be Cain the Murderer, Baphomet the Goat, Lucifer the Lightbearer, and Satan himself. She tells what they had to say. In the second hour, Tracy shares what she was told about the Black Sun, the origins of chess and an older version of the game called Ageio, meant to teach the story of the war in heaven. Later, we discuss the coming reign of the Anti-Christ, fallen angels, Tartarus, the deluge and the end of the world.

James Swagger is a researcher, field investigator and engineer who has dedicated the last 15 years of his life to researching megalithic sites and ancient cultures. James has been to over 400 megalithic tombs dotted across Europe, in addition to stone circles and henges in search of commonalities and design. James utilizes his engineering background as a systems analyst as a utility to reduce the complexity of ancient megalithic sites. He returns to discuss the Irish and Scottish origins of Halloween. He’ll talk about the Irish/Scottish ‘Samhain’ festival originating in the British Isles about 1300 years ago. He’ll tell about Celtic pagan rituals that relate to the megalithic calendar and solar wheel. James says pagans inherited their solar worship from the megalith builders. He also talks about how the church aimed to Christianize the Celtic pagans and how the shift from Hallows day became Hallows Eve or Halloween. In the second hour, we’ll hear about the mythology of spirits and inter-dimension beings at Halloween. He’ll talk about the Aos Si, banshees, witches, fairies and supernatural women of Ireland. We also hear about the Tuatha De Danann, a race of supernaturally-gifted people in Irish mythology. Later, we discuss other deities and festivals of pre-Christian Gaelic Ireland and variant branches of paganism.

Dave Dortch, an optometrist and his wife Kim, a nurse and nutritional therapy practitioner tell their story of ongoing police harassment after their 12 year old son was arrested and charged for graffiti vandalism in Riverside County. After the night their 12 year old son was arrested and interrogated without his parents or an attorney present, not surprisingly, he confessed. The Dortch’s tell what happened when an armed SWAT team appeared five weeks later at their house, demanding to search the house and stating they had a search warrant. However, the warrant was false on its face and the hear say "evidence" that their son had recommitted a crime has never been produced. Dave talks about being handcuffed in the back yard while cops played pool in their house and ate at their kitchen table. They even rummaged through his wife’s lingerie drawer. We’ll hear how their son was arrested multiple times for the same crime, once from school in ankle shackles and taken to juvenile jail where he was forced to experience inappropriate conditions. Dave shares what happened when the cops changed their focus onto him, questioning him about herbs found in his house. This led to a huge task force searching the Dortch’s house in hazmat suits making accusations that the Dortch’s were running a meth lab in their house. Dave was arrested without an arrest warrant or any charges. They’ll talk about the cops seizing their computers, being followed and intimidated. Kim talks about her fight against the city over her son and she tells of the outrageous court proceedings. In the second hour, they continue with the story and what led to the Dortch family attempting to take out a restraining order against members of local law enforcement. We’ll hear how the city made an accusation that David was part of a sovereign citizen’s movement and how city personnel were warned about it. Kim talks about the court’s tactics to keep this case sealed from the public. The Dortch family is fighting injustices at all costs to expose corruption and tyranny of U.S. law enforcement in Riverside County. Although, it’s a great battle, one that has contributed to them losing their house and going into debt, they’ll speak about why this is important. If you would like to help the Dortch family with their legal fund, please donate.

John de Nugent was born in Providence, Rhode Island and descends from the first British settlers of America in 1635, with his very distant ancestors (hence "de Nugent") having being “Normans,” that is Norwegian Vikings who conquered part of France around 900 AD, adopted the French culture and language and then carried out the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. John was a graduate of Georgetown University and he served with distinction in the United States Marine Corps and the Virginia Army National Guard. He began posting and blogging in 2007 on the ancient white Ice-Age Europeans called Solutreans. He speaks fluent German, French and good Spanish and blogs in three languages. John has been featured on many TV shows, although attacked for his views. He’ll discuss the white Solutreans, now believed by many anthropologists to have been the true Native Americans, settling the Americas around 20,000 BC, but then losing a war ten millennia later against the Amerindians, possibly after being nearly exterminated by a global environmental catastrophe, which may have involved a comet striking eastern North America. He’ll tell the story of the Solutreans and discuss why it is relevant today. We also talk about the Kennewick man found in Washington and the legal battle for the remains as indian tribes of northeastern Washington claim the remains are their own. Later, we hear about other White, blonde Indians and the Windover bog people of Florida. In the member’s hour, we’ll discuss finds of the Solutreans, their relationship with other Indians and how they disappeared. John also talks about the mysterious disappearance of the Wa-gas in NW California. John tells about the politically incorrect side of Asian American Indians. Later, we’ll discuss the theory of off world origins of blonde hair and blue eyes.

Tim Murdock is the host of White Rabbit Radio and producer of the popular animations, How The Whites Took Over America and Anti-Racist Hitler and Johnny Racist, which are constantly being censored. He returns to discuss the managerial class and why the establishment fears true independent alt media, now resorting to the removal of certain programs on ITunes, YouTube, Vimeo and elsewhere. Why is the enemy so afraid to talk about politics concerning White European folk? Why is it so threatening to the establishment? We’ll also talk about the difference between discussions and psychological warfare and what the opposition might have in store next since we’re constantly upping the ante. Tim tells why he simplifies things down to us vs. them, painting the enemy with a broad brush. Later on, we discuss how Europeans don’t have a morality that includes their own existence. He also brings up the important point that it’s much easier to be anti than pro something.

James Bowery is a pioneer in IT but is better known for his blogspot, Feral Observations. We’ll discuss his theory of Jewish virulence, which is analogous to immunosuppression virulence. He’ll put forth his hypothesis about the horizontal transmissions from which this virulence has evolved. This theory is complementary to both Kevin MacDonald's thesis documented in The Culture of Critique and to Richard Faussette's Niche Theory. James discusses nations as super organisms. The pre-Christian northern Europeans had a culture that recognized the dangers inherent in group organisms, which they called "giants," "serpents," "vipers" and "dragons" depending on the characteristic of the organism. He explains how civilization is group selection. Group selection is war. So what are we evolving as a group? He says this question must be asked before we talk about what kind of a system is best for our people. Later, we’ll explore a bit of pagan history and culture. Bowery also shares his viewpoint on sacred natural heterosexuality in what he calls the "State of Nature."

Tom Sunic (Tomislav Sunic) is an author, translator, former Croatian diplomat and a former US professor of political science. Mr. Sunic has published books, essays and newspaper articles in French, German, English and Croatian on subjects of cultural pessimism, politics, metapolitics and European identity. He joins us to discuss the banning of the National Policy Institute (NPI), conference in Hungary by the Hungarian government. NPI is an independent think-tank and publishing firm dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of European people in the United States and around the world. Based in the US, NPI hosts a number of events inviting top notch scholars and academics for the purpose of debate but the western establishment has labeled these scholars racists and extremists. Minister Sandor Pinter ordered that the scheduled speakers of the conference may not enter or stay in Hungary. Officials at the planned venue for the conference, cancelled reservations and the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced that the government would use “all legal means” to prevent the gathering. When conference attendees informally gathered at a restaurant, the president of NPI, Richard Spencer was arrested in Budapest as Hungary’s government stepped up its attempts to disrupt a gathering of nationalists, traditionalists and identitarians. Around 60 police officers in a dozen police vehicles converged on the Clock House Cafe in Buda late on Friday evening and took the names and passport numbers of everyone in attendance. Tom shares the events as he witnessed. What does this say about the European Union when debate at an academic level is labeled hate speech and banned, when scholars with opposing views are called criminals? Who decides what is freedom of speech and what is hate speech? It is hard to imagine a left-wing conference of any stamp being forcibly cancelled by a government. The banning of the NPI’s congress marks an escalation in state oppression. Tom shares his thoughts on the matter.

Dennis Fetcho, aka “The Fetch” is the author of the Illuminatus Observor and the host of the radio production called Inside the Eye. He brings weekly insights on geopolitics, Zionism, conspiracy history, finance, Middle East politics, news and views that shed light on our contemporary reality. Dennis is an American expatriate living in Amman. He specializes in aerospace, defense, and telecom. We’ll begin on ISIS. Dennis comments on events as told in the media. He’ll talk about how organized media is selling stories around the world as warfare. Then, we’ll discuss the supposed far right Nazi element in the Ukraine that is backed by Jewish interests. We’ll also talk about Russian nationalism, which is on the rise and the ongoing battle between Atlantic integrationists and Russia. Later, Dennis makes comparisons between Germany at the height of WWII with America today. In the second hour, Dennis speaks about elements of the Hermetic Qabalah, which have been encoded into the English language.

He’ll tell of the Osirian and Isian mystery schools and describe the two movements in play, found in the Torah. Later, we’ll hear about Noahide Law, which congress actually passed into law on Education Day, March 26, 1991. Dennis elaborates on how big the Noahide movement is. We’ll also talk about the power of vocalizing the truth, creating Qabalistic spells to reverse the spell.

As a U.S. Intelligence Asset, Susan Lindauer covered anti-terrorism at the Iraqi Embassy in New York from 1996 up to the invasion. Independent sources have confirmed that she gave advance warning about the 9/11 attack. She also started talks for the Lockerbie Trial with Libyan diplomats. Shortly after requesting to testify before Congress about successful elements of Pre-War Intelligence, Lindauer became one of the first non-Arab Americans arrested on the Patriot Act as an “Iraqi Agent.” She was accused of warning her second cousin, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and Secretary of State Colin Powell that War with Iraq would have catastrophic consequences. Gratis of the Patriot Act, her indictment was loaded with “secret charges” and “secret evidence.” She was subjected to one year in prison on Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas without a trial or hearing, and threatened with indefinite detention and forcible drugging to shut her up. After five years of indictment without a conviction or guilty plea, the Justice Department dismissed all charges five days before President Obama’s inauguration. In the first hour, Susan shares her story as a former CIA asset and provides inside knowledge of the Middle East conflict. We’ll talk about America’s meddling in the Middle East and what they’re creating. Later, Susan talks about the US Congress as Israel’s arm chair warriors in Washington. Everything comes back to Israel. Additionally, we discuss the important question of who was behind 911. She’ll tell what happened months before the event. In the second hour, Susan continues on her prosecution, detailing what happened when the judge ruled her mentally unfit for trial, thwarting her from speaking the truth and presenting evidence in court. She also comments on those who are suspicious of her story. Then, we’ll speak more about the 911 magician trick. Later, we discuss blowback created by the US government as the descent of American empire.

Kevin MacDonald received his Ph.D. in Biobehavioral Sciences and is Professor of Psychology at California State University, Long Beach. MacDonald is the author of seven books on evolutionary psychology and child development and is the author or editor of over thirty academic articles. His research focuses on evolutionary psychology and on ethnicity and ethnic group conflict. He is the founder of The Occidental Observer, an online publication presenting original content touching on the themes of white identity, white interests, and the culture of the west. In the first hour, we’ll begin on the speculative Khazar theory of the Jews and although not supported by empirical basis, it is used for political purposes. The theory reached a wider audience when Arthur Koestler published “The Thirteenth Tribe” in 1976. More recently Prof. Shlomo Sand published “The Invention of the Jewish People,” that further argues that the “Jewish people” is an invention, forged out of myths to justify Jewish ownership of the Land of Israel. Then we move on to discuss the long historical animosity between Jews and Western culture. Kevin talks about politics motivated by hatred. Later, we discuss the big business of immigration. In the member’s hour, we contend how it’s no accident that pro-European films are not being made, nor is media focusing on any positive aspects of Europeans or the West. Then, we discuss change in government that could have an influence on media and culture. We’ll also speak about the situation in California as demographics have drastically changed and tensions are mounting. Later, we comment on the Scottish independence referendum and voting fraud claims. The hour ends on the new kind of rebel emerging, antifa violence and the absurdity of Whites rejoicing the death of their culture.

He has worked as an investigative reporter for 30 years, writing articles on politics, medicine, and health. Jon has delivered lectures and seminars on global politics, health, logic, and creative power to audiences around the world. He returns to give a complete run down on the recent CDC scandal. On August 25, 2014 the CDC published a press release defending its 2004 study on autism. Two days later CDC whistleblower publicly admits he and his co-authors cooked that study and committed fraud. The CDC was referring to the 2004 study whistleblower William Thompson co-authored, the study he admitted was fraudulent, the study he and his co-authors slanted to bury the connection between the MMR vaccine and autism. Jon discusses the complexities behind this huge cover-up. Actor, Rob Schneider also said he has a copy of "the original CDC report that was later suppressed and fraudulently changed." Later, Jon talks about the striking similarity between the Thompson and Snowden stories. In this extended interview, we’ll continue discussing the vaccine as well as the length the CDC and government will go to obscure damage they’ve created. We’ll move on to talk about the Ebola epidemic. We’ll hear how the CDC is getting their numbers on cases and how it is being diagnosed. The CDC claims that there will be “1 million Ebola cases by January.” As Ebola victims fly into Western nations, Jon discusses what possible scenarios are being planned in the near future in Western nations.

Michael Hoffman is a former reporter for the Associated Press and the author of six books of radical history, journalism and literature. He describes himself as a "heretical writer." Hoffman is also the managing editor of the newsletter Revisionist History. We’ll discuss his book, They Were White and They Were Slaves: The Untold History of the Enslavement of Whites in Early America. First, Michael shares his inspiration for writing this book and why it is important to highlight this dark corner of suppressed history. He’ll tell of a hidden epoch, the slave trade of Whites, hundreds of thousands of whom were kidnapped, chained, whipped and worked to death in the American colonies and during the Industrial Revolution. We’ll learn about the artificial creation of the underclass and the emergence of the pauper class in England, which led to abduction into slavery. Michael explains how many poor Whites were taken from the British Isles and sent to America for slave labor against their will. He also elaborates on the false narrative surrounding indentured servitude. Additionally, we talk about how the cover-up of White slavery has impacted race relations today. Later, we talk about other historical aspects of slavery that are not discussed. In the second hour, we’ll discuss how the exclusion of politically incorrect aspects of history remains closeted and what must be done about it. Then, Michael talks about the Judas factor among White elites. Where is the yeoman resistance? We’ll also discuss the emergence of the idea of racial supremacy found in Judaic doctrine. He’ll explain the difference between self defense and racial supremacy and how it’s relevant today. Later, Michael comments on the root of White European problems. At the end, we return to White slavery as Hoffman explains the gradual transition from slavery to contractual servitude and he reminds us of the White slaves who were forcefully send to Australia.

Kai Murros is a Finnish intellectual well known for his book, Revolution: And How to Do It in a Modern Society. In his Master of Arts Thesis Murros studied the gradual change of the Chinese People's Liberation Army from a guerilla army to a modern professional army. Murros raised a nationwide scandal with his radically nationalist views and appetite for ruthless measures. Murros openly threatened leading Finnish CEOs and politicians that in the aftermath of the national revolution, they would be sent to prison camps as enemies of the people. Today, Murros leads a quiet life of a free thinker tending his garden. In the first hour, we’ll begin on Sweden’s “survivor’s guilt” as they take in more refugees than they can possibly handle. Kai speaks about how ethnic civil war in inevitable in Sweden’s future. Then, we’ll discuss revolution using a radically Machiavellian approach. He’ll talk about how he sees the western industrial societies disintegrating and how a new nation state will then be formed. He’ll speak on hate as a revolutionary force, a necessary human emotion, nature that cannot be contained. Later, we’ll talk about pan-European nationalism and culture as we’ve never seen before. In the second hour, Kai speaks on the appeal of pan-European nationalism and the coming revival of European culture that will reflect the new reality. The new counter culture is already well on its way. We’ll also talk about the value of myths, stories and word to bind people together. He continues talking about the need for a healthy dose of narcissism to counteract the years of being taught to hate ourselves. Kai also shares his view on the pagan vs. Christian debate. Later, we talk about the university system, increasing government control, fighting for resources and western medicine.

Frank Salter is an Australian academic and researcher at the former Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology. He is a political ethologist, studying political phenomena using the methods and theories of behavioral biology in addition to conventional methods. He is the author of six books. In the first hour, Frank explains how the social sciences were radicalized in universities as a way to gain control of the culture. We’ll talk about the university departments of sociology, cultural anthropology and political science which are devoid of biologically-oriented courses and why the focus is on gender, ethnicity, feminism, sex differences, national identity, ethno-cultural diversity, multiculturalism and immigration. Later, we talk about a few of the iconic people that are praised by today’s social sciences, several of whom are known to have falsified scientific results. Frank says we must inject fact back into culture. In the second hour, we’ll discuss the effects of the social sciences’ rejection of human nature and how it has impacted current politics and culture. We’ll discuss what may happen if we continue to deny human nature. Later, Frank talks about admitting harsh realities and what we can do to move forward.

David Eberhard is a Swedish psychologist, writer and debater. He was a physician at the psychiatric emergency room at St Görans, one of Sweden's oldest hospitals. His current position is in the psychiatry department at Danderyd’s Hospital in Stockholm. He is the author of four books penned in Swedish, “How Children Took Power,” “Normal? From Madness to Everyday Psychosis,” ”Nobody Takes Shit In The Land of the Easily Offended” and “In the Land of the Security Junkies.” We’ll begin on Sweden’s obsession with security and discuss what long term conditions this obsession has created among the people. Since the state has taken on responsibilities that should be personally handled by an adult, most Swedes are incapable of dealing with conflict and hardship. This leads to psychological problems. Without challenges and the ability to overcome obstacles, the value of life diminishes. In the second hour, we criticize the much praised childrearing policies of Sweden. David explains how these practices will lead to long term psychological problems among the population. Despite extensive studies of monozygotic twins, which prove that environment isn’t everything, the state chooses to ignore research on genes, biology and human nature. Eberhard further warns about how this system is being exported to the rest of the west. We’ll also discuss why children need boundaries and discipline. Instead, we are now raising a generation of brats that have taken power from their parents. Later, we talk about Sweden’s gender neutrality craze. At the end, David talks about how those who dare speak of the problems with Sweden’s immigration policies are ostracized.

Considered one of the classics of conspiracy research, David Icke has spent the last quarter of a century unraveling the secrets of the universe, reality and the forces that manipulate our world. After writing more than 20 books, David Icke has driven on with his unrelentless investigation into subject areas that others don't dare touch. Icke joins us for a short segment to shares his thoughts on the latest pedophile network scandal in Rotherham, England. The lives of 1,400 White British girls in Rotherham have been sacrificed on the altar of political correctness and helped to once again expose the giant multicultural lie. Ann Cryer, a courageous former Labour MP for Keighley, was one of the first to raise the alarm in 2003 when she complained about gangs of Pakistanian pimps recruiting young British girls at the gates of schools in her constituency. Despite these and many other warnings, it took the police and authorities 11 years to act on this information. Despite these young girls calling out for help, being abused sexually, getting addicted to drugs and used in the most horrible conditions, it was political correctness and fear of being denounced as a “racist” that prevented action to be taken against these unspeakable crimes. David talks about how the how the Blair government opened the flood gates of immigration into the UK in order to change the country and the culture. Towards the end, we discuss British colonialism and why it’s a major error to believe that these kinds of atrocities is sound “payback” for what people have been told happened during the time of the British Empire. When will people turn their back on political correctness, realize that multiculturalism is a tool for the globalists and cease the endless double standards?

A serious student of pre-Spanish Canary Island culture, Gordon Kennedy has been collecting historical information about the Guanches since 1975 and is recognized as one of the world's authorities on this Indo-European anomaly, with his Guanche archives amongst the largest on earth. He has personally explored the caves, beaches, museums and mountains of the islands and studied many Guanche mummies, tools, pottery and personal artifacts. Kennedy remains one of the few American authors to publish scientific research on this topic in the past 100 years, and his personal library contains some of the most extensive records of Guanche existence, having been mined and published by the scientific community for several decades. In this program, we discuss Gordon’s book The White Indians of Nivaria: The Untold Story of the Last Stone-Age Indo-European Tribes. Gordon speaks about the travels of Thor Heyerdahl, which sparked his interest into looking at ancient civilization on Canary Island. Kennedy’s book is an anthropological odyssey and true historical account of White natives living on seven African islands, for many thousands of years. It’s a lost and forgotten chapter of Indo-European pre-history that describes a Western settlement on an Eden-like volcanic archipelago, inhabited by an indigenous population of Caucasians. This is a rare glimpse into a pre-Christian Western culture on a tropical island. In the second hour, we’ll talk about what happened to ancient empires once massive amounts of guest workers immigrated into their lands, breaking up the host culture. The Guanche Indians also mummified their dead, constructed ceremonial pyramids and spoke a unique language. They were custodians of an ancient spiritual legacy from the ancestral memories of Indo-European evolution. This is a fascinating piece of covered up history seldom addressed.

In the second hour, we’ll discuss Israel, the Hamas and the aggression against Palestine. Then, we’ll talk about events between Russia and the Ukraine. Patrick explains the agenda of removing Russia from the international scene with the main goal to isolate Russia, an ally of Syria, culturally and financially. Since Russia cannot be folded into the European Union, they must be broken down. We’ll talk about how Russia fits into NATO’s long term plan. Meanwhile, as Russia encourages making babies, the authorities in Rotherham England turn a blind eye to the sexual abuse of 1400 English children, who were exploited by Pakistani gangs of pedophiles, in fear of being labeled racist. We’ll end the hour discussing how insane political correctness can get.

He hosts NRR-Northern Runes Radio, a podcast exploring the Northern European Mythos both religiously, and esoterically. Throughout the program, we’ll discuss what it means to live the Asatru way in the 21st century, awakening our ancient awareness. Daniel first clarifies misunderstandings associated with Asatru such as it being a religion. We’ll hear about the European folk code of honor, ethics, the 9 noble virtues and the 3 norns. Daniel speaks about our ancestral folk traditions and their view of the “dead.” Later, we talk about embracing the struggle so our folk can become more. Struggle is an essential part of being alive and progressing. In the second hour, we’ll discuss European folk who have forgotten who they are, who have lost connection to the folk soul. Additionally, western fallacies have indoctrinated us to lower the bar. Now we must reverse the decay. Daniel also talks about the ways in which Christianity is in opposition to Asatru, such as teaching unworthiness. We’ll discuss the path to becoming more and the battle for the mind and soul of our people. Later, Daniel provides more examples of the Asatru way and how to implement it into our modern lives. He also tells us about the positive Viking view of women and how Vikings were not mindless barbarians as we are told to believe. Daniel leaves us with a closing message.

Josh Reeves is a Dallas, Texas-based researcher, filmmaker, musician, and radio talk show host who after years of researching government conspiracies and secret societies, has dove into the world of hidden ancient mysteries. Stemming from his ten years of research on the ancient Rockwall in the suburbs of his hometown of Dallas, Texas, Josh has released almost 6 hours worth of film in 2013 and 2014 with his Lost Secrets of Ancient America Series. Volume 3 of the series is currently in production and you can see all his films at theglobalreality.com Josh is an independent researcher who brings over 25 years of research to the table in his quest to expose the hidden truths. In this program, we discuss his second volume of Lost Secrets of Ancient America. Josh and his co-producer have driven all over America to film at some of the most spectacular structures and ancient earthworks to find a connection between them. We’ll discuss the paleo police who have taken control of the story of our origins and how anthropology has been weaponized in order to keep us in the dark about our ancient history. Finds throughout North and South America suggest a very different history then the official one. In the second hour, we speak about ancient tribes that fought over territory and traded with each other. There seems to have been a concerted effort to exterminate the giants in some areas, such as what occurred at Lovelock Cave. Josh also went close to Area 51 and speculates as to why this type of testing ground ended up so close to several ancient sites.

Jessica Andreasson is an immigrant living in Sweden, married to a Swede. She’ll share her experience living in Sweden, the country touted as the social and political role model for western nations. We’ll talk about social issues that no one in Sweden likes to discuss such as alcoholism, high unemployment rates and the negative blowback of mass immigration. We’ll talk about the cultural climate in Sweden and the changing social behavior of Swedes. Jessica also shares her encounters with the Swedish socialized healthcare system. In the second hour, we’ll speak more about the history of Sweden, specifically on the Vikings and Norse mythology. We’ll talk about how Swedes are being indoctrinated through the school system to be self hating people who despise their own culture, contrary to the Viking spirit. Then, we’ll discuss Sweden’s state feminism and their hatred for Swedish men, while at the same time experiencing a rape epidemic from the immigrant population. The leftist programming is like nothing else in Sweden. Jessica talks about how she has been accused of being a racist and a Nazi for pointing out cultural differences between people. Later, we talk about how countries must evolve as a people to attain a higher level of living. It’s an important process that some counties have not yet gone through.

Zen Gardner began his online writing and blogging 8 years ago after a lifelong quest for truth and several major life changes. His focus is empowering humanity to reach its full potential in conscious awareness and its resultant activation in the expression of our lives. He writes on a variety of subjects from earth and human origins and our manipulated spiritual and historical context, to current political events in an effort to dismantle old mind sets in order to free and encourage the awakening of human consciousness that is readily available to all. In this program, Zen discusses the process of awakening the warrior. He’ll talk about breaking free from passivity and how to take initiative. Also, we talk about the problem with Zionism and their genocide attempts. Zen says we’re coming to a point where we won’t be able to compromise any longer. It is our responsibility to respond against violence. He emphasises that this battle needs warriors, not observers standing on the sidelines with pity and guilt. Those who don’t yet recognize that we are engaged in a war, will soon be awakened to it. Later, Gardner talks about pornography and feminism as a tool to break down the family, to degrade and create imbalance between the sexes. In the second hour, we’ll speak about Zionist control of the media and the insanity of Christian Zionists, who support Israel at all costs. We’ll also talk about escapism, increased suicide rates and urban warfare. Near the end, we discuss heroism of the warrior as the method of resolution.

Why are European women more supportive of mass immigration and multiculturalism? We’ll discuss why European women can’t see the active destruction of their culture and race. From miscegenation programming and being called racist for wanting to date their own race, White women are pushed in the name of altruism to make brown babies if any babies at all, falling in line with the Zionist, anti-White agenda. Sinead and Megan will discuss the politically incorrect side of miscegenation. We’ll also talk about feminism and the detrimental effects of women sleeping around. Later, we’ll talk about why White birth rates are low. How do we encourage White women to have more children and destroy the misconceptions about child rearing? They’ll also share fertility tips for women. Later, we discuss ways to raise our European children in a multicultural world.

Mark Passio is an independent researcher, public speaker, radio talk show host, conference organizer and freedom activist from Philadelphia. Mark has undertaken the task of assembling vast amounts of research in the areas of metaphysics, occultism, spirituality, symbology and consciousness studies. Last time Mark was on the program, we discussed New Age deception and the faults and fallacies of this pacifying religion. In this follow up program, we’ll discuss further how New Age belief has been used to quell healthy opposition and hold back rage in response to our subjugation. This ideology is highly useful for globalist elites who go unchecked. Mark also explains the application of self-defense (violence) and healthy, natural responses to the agenda of enslavement. When will good men and women organize and do something about it? In the second hour, we’ll discuss the predicament of our times and explain how the new age, coupled with other recent political inventions and social constructs has been created to plague the west, such as political correctness. Later, we talk about how to fight a multiple front warfare and how to infiltrate the system on all levels. Additionally, Mark speaks about what it really means to become “enlightened.” The second hour ends asking, “What is real spirituality?”

Jeanice Barcelo is a birth activist and whistleblower. She is an outspoken voice in the movement to expose the violence of hospital birth and to get birth out of the hospitals and back into the home. Through her radio and television shows, and in her forthcoming book series, she speaks out about the horrors of technologically-managed pregnancy and childbirth. Jeanice has spent the last 15 years uncovering the long-term and inter-generational impact of primal trauma on the human body, mind, spirit system. She returns to discuss the dark side of the baby making industry, who controls it and whose genetics are being sought after. From masturbatoriums, to fertility drugs and intended parents shopping for sperm and eggs, what kind of children are we creating? We’ll talk about infertility in western nations and how it is reversible. Jeanice also comments on reasons for the low White birth rates. She’ll read some chilling quotes from Abe Foxman and Rabbi Finkelstein regarding the destruction of Aryan children and the push for interracial marriages for Whites. We’ll talk about reproductive technologies in Israel that allow the use of eggs from aborted babies and postmortem sperm recovery. Meanwhile, a high price is paid for sperm from blonde, blue-eyed American men, which is going around the globe including to third world nations, to try to create light-skinned blonde kids. One of those countries receiving Aryan sperm and eggs is Israel. Why are they seeking the Nordic gene? In the member’s hour, Jeanice speaks on the spiritual war on the pristine human. We’ll also talk about how indeed it is Jews that have been the ones seeking the master race. Also, we discuss the Jewish circumcision ritual known as metzitzah b'peh that involves a mohel using his mouth to remove blood from the recently-cut penis. Infants have died from this ritual. Later on, we’ll talk about male/female relationships, parenting and more.

Jack Donovan is the author of The Way of Men, and an advocate for the resurgence of tribalism and masculine virtue. He’s also known for his criticisms of feminism and gay culture. Jack is a contributor to AlternativeRight.com, Counter Currents, Radix Journal, and The Spearhead. We’re going to discuss what is controversial these days, Violence, Masculinity and Tribalism. For thousands of years mankind has settled territories, disputes and enforced laws through acts of violence. Order demands violence. Today we resort to proxy violence. Is this better or worse? We’ll talk about masculinity, the male crisis and the missing brotherhood. There was a time when Strength, Courage, Mastery, and Honor were an important part of being a man. When speaking on matters of the state, can we ultimately fight corruption through non-violent means? We’ll also discuss how big government has killed risk, competition and the primal drive to survive and how it has negatively affected men in western society. Are religion, new age ideologies and egalitarianism a revolt against nature? Later on we’ll talk about the gender neutral fad, the feminization of men and gay culture. Also, we talk about the imbalanced relationship between the sexes and how modern society refuses to acknowledge biological differences between men and women.

John Lash is a self-educated free-lance scholar and author who combines studies and experimental mysticism to teach directive mythology. He is a leading exponent of the power of myth to direct individual experience and drive historical events over the long term. On metahistory.org, he presents a radical revision of Gnosticism, with original commentaries on the Nag Hammadi codices. He also presents the only complete restoration by any scholar of the Sophianic myth of the Pagan Mysteries, the sacred story of Gaia-Sophia, recounting the origin of the earth and the human species from the galactic core. Unexpectedly, John Lash returns to discuss how he recently came to the political issue of White genocide after being deeply involved within the Sophianic myth. Johns explains how he discovered that the myth itself contains details of White genocide. We’ll discuss the supernatural factor behind this plan, an archontic force at play that has infected a specific race who are serving as proxies of the Archons. Raging on the planet, this archontic infection is both neurological and ideological. John talks about Sophia’s correction, her collaborators and what can stop the archontic infection as told by the Gnostics. We’ll continue to profile the problem and discuss the taboo of stating the obvious. Lash gives two perspectives on why we didn’t see this agenda sooner. Also, he explains why the Gnostics were against procreation and how they warned it could be used as a weapon. Later, John speaks on the importance of reviving folk memory circuits and recovering important racial memory. At the end we’ll discuss Jewish liberation in 1859 and how they got the upper hand. John also talks about German genocide. When blowback falls on the sources of fraud, there will be no place to hide.

Swedish art gallery owner Henrik Rönnquist returns to discuss the latest news concerning art censorship in Sweden. Last we spoke, Dan Park a Swedish artist, was arrested and sentenced to jail for his street art. When Park uploaded pictures on his blog to tell his fans what was going on - he received another prison sentence for doing so. Henrik recently had a private art exhibit which featured several of Dan Park’s pieces. During the day of the showing, both protestors and police were standing in front of the gallery. Protestors were screaming “Nazi swine,” “fascist” and “racist” from the streets behind the police barricade. Henrik talks about what happened when the cops eventually stormed his gallery, arrested Dan Park again and left with 9 pieces of art 30 minutes into the showing. Henrik was told by the police that he wasn’t being arrested “out of consideration for the opening” but he indeed was facing charges. He’ll discuss what he is being charged for and why this particular art is creating such an uproar in “tolerant” “anti-fascist” Sweden. Henrik talks about why freedom of art must be free. He is prepared to fight this all the way, although he’s facing violent threats and financial loss. We’ll also hear about the African-Swedish Association who headed the hate crime accusation. Rönnquist says what’s happening in Sweden now is very, very dangerous and Sweden is heading towards dictatorship. He makes the comparison to the book The Whisperers: Private life in Stalin’s Russia. Meanwhile, Sweden’s welfare system is crumbling and immigrants are arriving daily with no papers and getting entitlements that even Swede’s do not get.

From New South Wales, Australia Max Igan runs the website thecrowhouse.com, which covers a vast array of different topics spanning from government corruption to the mysteries of our ancient past. In this program we discuss Zionist terrorism in Gaza and the current bombing campaign and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. We’ll talk about the lies pushed by the Zionist controlled mainstream on this issue and the double standards of Israel’s policies. Max also talks about his visit to the Gaza Strip and the many kind Palestinians he met there. He tells us how he entered in to the checkpoint ridden area using one of the many tunnels from the Egyptian side, where he also met border officers from Hamas. Later, we discuss the monumental lies and disinformation surrounding World War II, especially what happened to Germany. In the second hour, we’ll talk about how to weaken the influence of the Zionist controlled media. Max highlights previous atrocities in Palestine, such as the death of Rachel Corrie and the people murdered on the Gaza flotilla. The hour ends on the huge problem with Christian Zionists, who support Israel unequivocally on the basis of religious programing.

Ricardo Duchesne teaches sociology and world history at The University of New Brunswick. His publications include one book, 45 refereed articles, one chapter, 13 encyclopedia entries, and 18 non-refereed articles. His book, The Uniqueness of Western Civilization, a major work of 528 pages, was released in February 2011. Currently he is doing research on multiculturalism and the identity crisis of the West. We’ll begin discussing Vancouver City Council’s vote to investigate discriminatory laws and policies imposed by Whites on Chinese immigrants in the city between 1886 and 1947, in order to come up with recommendations for "reconciliation efforts." The approved motion was initiated by Chinese Councilor Raymond Louie. It also calls for staff to report back to council with recommended actions for further compensation and reconciliation efforts. Ricardo is facing complaints after calling Vancouver’s plan an exercise in manipulating white guilt. Then, he’ll discuss how European Canadian history is presented only negatively in Canadian schools, ignoring the pioneering spirit and great accomplishments. We’ll also discuss the erroneous argument being made that all European countries are immigrant countries and that nations are made strong by diversity. Ricardo also talks about the Canadian model of immigration and multiculturalism. In the second hour, we’ll discuss many topics such as nationalist parties in Europe, capitalism, cycles of civilization and young generations who are being brainwashed by diversity dogma. Ricardo speaks about how events will lead to ethnic separatism as events escalate over time. Later, we’ll talk about the foolishness of a “greater good” and making hard decisions, not morally righteous choices that benefit no one. We’ll also discuss immigration restriction from an environmental perspective, which is now politically incorrect to discuss. At the end, Ricardo talks about the current trend to degrade European achievement.

Considered one of the classics of conspiracy research, David Icke has spent the last quarter of a century unraveling the secrets of the universe, reality and the forces that manipulate our world. After writing more than 20 books, David Icke has driven on with his unrelentless investigation into subject areas that others don't dare touch. Icke shares his analysis of US occupation in the Middle East. He’ll also talk about ISIS, with an alleged extremist Islamic agenda, yet silence from Israel. We’ll talk about the genocide of Palestinians and the redrawing of the Middle East with Israel as the new dictator. David discusses the origins of Israel, which is based on a hoax. He’ll discuss events leading up to the creation of the State of Israel. Then, we’ll talk about where the elite want to take the world and the techniques they’re using to get there. Their techniques include the destruction of nationhood and forced multiculturalism. Icke comments on Europeans who are re-acting to preserve their nationhood, challenging the European Union and fighting back. We’ll talk about how the elite are working hard to establish a one world culture, a mono everything, through killing true diversity. Later, he’ll speak on the inner core of Zionism that functions like a secret society. We also talk about how young Jews are being programmed from birth and being used for a bigger strategy. At the end we discuss how people are frightened into silence, sticking their heads in the sand but this will not make the problems go away. Diversity of everything, including power is needed.

We'll discuss current politics in America ranging from insane leftists such as Bill Ayers, to communism and neo-cons who push for war. Jay speaks about how we're on the precipice of either a successful revolution or the final throes of the ending of our civilization.

Michael T. Griffith holds a Master's degree in Theology from The Catholic Distance University, a Graduate Certificate in Ancient and Classical History from American Military University, a Bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts from Excelsior College, two Associate in Applied Science degrees from the Community College of the Air Force, and an Advanced Certificate of Civil War Studies and a Certificate of Civil War Studies from Carroll College.

He is the author of four books, numerous articles and a DVD called, A Southern View of the Civil War. We'll discuss the truth surrounding Civil War events such as what caused the war, who caused the war and why the South seceded. As most southerners know, the Civil War was not about slavery. In fact, White slaves were also common. Michael talks about the usurpations of Abraham Lincoln, Northern dissent, racism and total war against the South. We'll also hear how Blacks, Hispanics and Indians fought on the Confederate side and also about Andersonville Prison, where thousands of Union prisoners died of starvation, disease, and exposure. Lawlessness abounded on all sides after the reconstruction era. We'll talk about why the KKK was formed, who their targets were and what they were responding to. This side of the story is rarely heard. Later, Michael gives his take on the Lincoln assassination and he responds to the accusation that the founding fathers of America were racists.

Kyle Hunt received his BA in psychology and theater, worked briefly in Silicon Valley, and then became involved in the alternative media in 2008. Over the years he has covered topics such as symbolism, mythology, occultism, synchronicity, spirituality, paganism, racial realities, revisionist history, politics, and anything else that might pique his interest. Kyle is best known for previously blogging on Star Theory, hosting a show on the now defunct Oracle Broadcasting Network, founding Renegade Broadcasting, and most recently leading the controversial White Man March in an effort to raise awareness concerning the ongoing genocide of European people across the world. In the first hour, Kyle shares his journey from synchromysticism into the study of ZOG. Voltaire said, "To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize." In today's PC environment, we'll discuss the one group you cannot criticize. But to find out who is oppressed, simply find out the one group you cannot support. We'll discuss White identity and interests in a so called "post-racial" America. Kyle talks about the blatant double standards and hypocritical justifications found within the ideology of "diversity" and "tolerance." We'll also discuss revisionist history pertaining to WWII and the holocaust. Later, we discuss how feminists demonize European men while they turn around and support Muslims who treat women and gays horribly. Also, we talk about Sarkozy's "challenge of the 21st century," racial interbreeding. In the second hour, we'll begin discussing how the military is being used to institute policies favorable to Israel. Kyle talks about the creation of the goy vs. goy conflict. We'll elaborate on the motives of Jews who push multiculturalism upon European countries but not in Israel. In America illegals are allowed to flood in through the southern border. We'll talk about how this isn't beneficial to anyone. Later, we'll discuss the naivety and indoctrination of European people and radicals who hate Whites. The second hour ends on elites who are ramping up a race war.

Thomas Sheridan is an author, artist, musician, satirist and independent researcher, best known for the book, Puzzling People: the Labyrinth of the Psychopath, along with his writings on socio-cultural engineering, propaganda and the influence of late Victorian occult societies and policy think-tanks upon the creation of both Fascism and Bolshevism, and the paralysing shadow these aristocratically created and cultivated symbiotic ideologies have cast upon the face of humanity. In the first hour, we'll talk about cultural Marxism as a corrosive force in Europe that piggybacks on the environmental movement, the gay rights movement and other minorities to further its cause. Then, we'll discuss Germany as the heart of Europe and those who sought to create a new kind of German, a mechanical man. Thomas talks about the making of a Bavarian Bolshevik and a great psyop that took place in Germany. Later, we discuss how Europeans have been fractured by Semitic traditions and archetypes. In the member's hour, Thomas elaborates on the extraordinary heritage of Europeans, which is diverse and should be celebrated not shunned. He talks about how European folklore, sagas and mythology help to change consciousness. Also, we discuss disinfo coming out of Hollywood surrounding European history and the psyop of the "White man's burden." We'll talk about Irish slaves, the American Civil War and re-examining history. Later, we'll discuss the portrayal of the "dumb White man" as well as the Marxist instigated war between women and men. At the end, Thomas elaborates on winning the culture war.

Stephen A. McNallen is a prominent religious leader of the native European path called Asatro. McNallen established the first legally recognized Asatro organization in the US in 1972 and quickly became a prolific writer and speaker on the subject on Germanic Paganism, which broadly includes the ancient tribes of Northern Europe. He believes that spiritual fulfillment is best achieved by following the ways of one's ancestors. In the first hour, Stephen addresses the importance of venerating our ancestors. He explains how discovering our ancestral past is vital for our future. We'll talk about what happens when one is cut off from their ancestral roots and how powerful interests rely on it. Stephen discusses how the "world managers" work to get the masses to lose their impulse for something deeper. They belittle honor, courage and heroism for reasons of control as these pose a threat to the system. Later, Stephen talks about the falsification of Europe's history, which always portrays Europeans as the evil ones, and people disown their ancestors because of it. In the member's hour, we'll hear about metagenetics and the idea that ancestry matters - that there are spiritual and metaphysical implications to heredity. He ties together varied topics as Jung's theories of archetypes, rebirth in the family line, psychic links between twins, and the Norse concept of the soul to support that statement. We'll also talk about how biology is being ignored to push egalitarianism. Later, McNallen talks about reigniting the spark, reconnecting to that which is in us. We're the outcome of all who have gone before us and their decisions up until this point. The hour ends on Odin's model of evolution.

Historian and former Professor, E. Michael Jones is editor of Culture Wars Magazine and author of many books, including Libido Dominandi: Sexual Liberation & Political Control and The Jewish Revolutionary Spirit: And Its Impact on World History. We begin the hour discussing the triple melting pot theory of American assimilation, involving three ethnic groups and three religions: Catholic, Protestant and Jewish. Jones elaborates on the culture war between the Catholics and the Jews. Then, he'll talk about how sexual "liberation" is used for political control and a form of covert warfare. E. Michael discusses how the original American culture was taken over and supplanted with a Jewish culture. Later, we discuss the rise of political correctness and blowblack of covert operations. In the member's hour, Jones explains the relationship between Catholics and Jews and details where their conflict stems from. He shares his view on what must take place in order for the two to live in the same culture. We'll move on to discuss mass immigration into Europe and the Jewish role behind multiculturalism, while at the same time Israel maintains the last ethnic racial state in the world. Multiculturalism is having the opposite effect of what we're told, but this is by design. E. Michael shares a different take on the impact of Islam in Europe. He also comments on Pope Francis who said Europe needs to bring in more immigrants. Later in the hour, Jones talks about how we are witnessing the end of the American empire.

Gregory Sams has been a health food pioneer from the 1960's. In 1967, he and his brother Craig introduced organic and natural foods to the UK marketplace. After 15 years of catering, Seed magazine, Ceres Grain Store & Bakery, Harmony & Whole Earth Foods, in 1982 Gregory conceived and christened the original VegeBurger. In the 80's, he also became fascinated with the scientific ideas of chaos theory, so he founded Strange Attractions, a shop dedicated to chaos theory. Sams' lifelong passions, health, culture and consciousness culminated in two books. He returns to discuss his latest work, The State is Out of Date: We Can Do Better. He'll discuss today's disenchantment over the top-down power structure that increasingly manages our lives vs. the beauty of bottom-up self organization. He explains how we are community animals with built-in empathy; we are good at getting on with each other, organizing best from the bottom up. Our culture's most essential and reliable features came into being without central planning. Top down control by a coercive state has been going on for less than 4500 of modern human's 100,000 years on planet Earth. Its every variation has eventually failed, often bringing down the civilization than it had fed upon. He says, we can do a better job of things ourselves than can those "in charge," regardless of how much money they have to spend or how good their intentions may be. Gregory criticizes our societal structure that does not serve the majority. Where the state steps into our affairs, problems arise. Gregory explains how the state holds us back from natural order and nature's harmony.

David McGowan was born and raised in Torrance, California, just twenty miles south of Laurel Canyon. He graduated from UCLA with a degree in psychology and has, since 1990, run a small business in the greater Los Angeles area. He is also a lifelong music fan who still frequently keeps his radio tuned to classic rock stations. McGowan's previous books include Programmed to Kill: The Politics of Serial Murder, and Understanding the F-Word: American Fascism and the Politics of Illusion. We'll discuss his new book Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon: Laurel Canyon, Covert Ops & The Dark Heart of the Hippie Dream. We'll discuss the dark underbelly of the hippie "utopia." Many think the hippie movement began in San Francisco but it was actually Laurel Canyon, a neighborhood in Los Angeles. Although LA at that time didn't have a music scene, musicians were mysteriously drawn to LA and mysteriously converged in Laurel Canyon. We'll discuss how Laurel Canyon in the 1960s and early 1970s was a magical place where a dizzying array of musical artists congregated to create much of the music that provided the soundtrack to those turbulent times. Also floating about the periphery were various political operatives, up-and-coming politicians, and intelligence personnel - the same sort of people who just happened to give birth to many of the rock stars populating the canyon. Also integrated into the scene was a guy by the name of Charles Manson, along with his murderous entourage. And all of the canyon's colorful characters - rock stars, hippies, murderers, and politicos - happily coexisted alongside a covert military installation. We'll talk about the creation of the "hippie" style, which didn't appear to happen organically. David also talks about misconceptions surrounding the hippie movement. In the second hour, David talks about groupies, drugs and the CIA in the hippie era. He also talks about music that arose after the hippie movement such as punk and new wave. We'll hear about the Copeland family, another military intelligence family, who were instrumental behind the scenes.

Felice Vinci is a nuclear engineer, amateur historian and author of The Baltic Origins of Homer's Epic Tales, The Illiad, The Odyssey and The Migration of Myth. William Mullen received his BA in Classics from Harvard College and his PhD from the University of Texas. He was a Professor or post-doctoral Fellow at Berkeley, Princeton, Boston University, and Harvard's Center for Hellenic Studies and St. John's College. Dr. Mullen settled in the Classics Department at Bard College in 1985. Felice shares compelling evidence that the events of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey took place in the Baltic and not the Mediterranean. For years scholars have debated the incongruities in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, given that his descriptions are at odds with the geography of the areas he purportedly describes. Felice and Bill discuss how a climate change forced the migration of a people and their myth to ancient Greece. Felice identifies the true geographic sites of Troy and Ithaca in the Baltic Sea and Calypso's Isle in the North Atlantic Ocean. We'll hear where the story suggests that the events took place in the Baltic, such as Ulysses' journey along what sounds like the coasts of Norway. Also, we talk about why some tribes in Northern Europe might have stayed during the climate change. Later, we compare Homeric poems with Viking mythology to find similarities and compare Greco-Roman Gods and Goddesses to Norse Gods and Goddesses. Felice Vinci offers a key to open many doors that allow us to consider the age-old question of the Indo-European diaspora and the origin of the Greek civilization from a new perspective.

Author David Warner Mathisen was almost twenty years a literalist, reading the Old and New Testament scriptures carefully and literally. He began to finally see the outlines of the vast system that underlies the ancient scriptures preserved in the Bible, in other scriptures which were rejected from inclusion in the Bible by what David calls "the literalists." We'll discuss his latest book, The Undying Stars. He talks about how almost every culture around the world personifies the powers of the planets, the sun, moon and stars, connecting to the same powers within every man and woman, in the organs of the human body. The stories found in the Bible were originally based upon the same allegorization and were intended to point towards consciousness and the divinity in mankind as well. David explains how the messages of esoteric myths were intended to convey a shamanic-holographic worldview but was deliberately suppressed by forces who took over the Roman Empire. Also, we'll discuss the deal struck between the Roman generals and Josephus during the Roman invasion of Judea. David talks about the copper scrolls that pointed to major treasures. In the second hour, we'll talk about how Christianity was formulated through the vehicle of Mithraism and also how it took over the Roman Empire. There was a suppression of pre-Christian traditions in Europe built on the same esoteric knowledge and when some of the royal houses were formulated, this hunt spread to other parts of the world, including the Americas.

Attie Schutte is an Afrikaner blogger and political activist who lives and works in Johannesburg, South Africa. His interest varies from self-sufficient localism and Ethno-Nationalism to Austrian economics and the various schools of Anarchism. He's a member of the Orania Movement. We'll discuss never spoken of events in South Africa that concern colonialism, Apartheid and post-Apartheid life. Attie also shares some history of early Europeans in South Africa. What is life like in South Africa's "rainbow nation" How is the White minority treated in South Africa Attie tells about violence against White South Africans and why the media doesn't report it. We'll discuss healthy segregation verses government intervention and how government is always a force behind genocide. Attie speaks against government policy involving discrimination and race based conflicts. Government always creates more problems. We'll talk about one Afrikaner self determined community called Orania that refuses to be part of South Africa's "rainbow nation" and how they're labeled racists for propagating Afrikaner culture in solitude. Orania is the only hope of survival for the Afrikaners wanting their own government, in their own territory. We talk about the healthy aspect of separate homelands for every ethnic group and how it can bring the most amount of peace. Later, we discuss the current colonization of Europe, the failure of democracy and the idea of Free Market Nationalism.

Joseph Atwill is an independent scholar who has set the world of New Testament scholarship in a new direction. In his book Caesar's Messiah, Atwill outlines the series of events in Jesus' ministry that are parallels with the events of the battle campaign of Titus Flavius. He returns to discuss his latest work, Shakespeare's Secret Messiah. Continuing his expos頯n the New Testament, Atwill demonstrates that the thrust behind the famous playwright's work was to wreak literary revenge against Titus, Rome and Christians. Joseph explains how the plays are a reversing of the typology of the gospels, from a Jewish perspective. The Bard's hidden war on the Roman Catholic Church, encoded in 'puzzle passages' in the plays, is the key that finally unlocks the true identity of 'Shakespeare,' explaining why the real author chose to hide behind a pseudonym. In the second hour, we'll discuss how religion was used as part of the futile system. We also talk about A Course in Miracles, the 60's hippie movement and entertainment as mind control ops that are part of today's slave system. Then, we'll continue on neo-feudalist techniques going on today. Later, we talk about deliberate actions aimed at destroying the west and the current vengeance on the European people.

Vahan Setyan has been examining world mythology, language and civilizations for the last decade. He is an independent researcher and regularly collaborates with scholars and researchers in various fields including anthropology and Armenology. He continues with his collaborations with Armenologists and historians around the world to further examine, decipher and reveal most of the prehistoric elements that continue to be hidden within the Armenian highlands, the Armenian language and their revolutionary effects on human civilization and languages. He has contributed to articles on ancient mythology, ancient Armenian history and its language. He is the author of "Enigma of the Armenian Alphabet: Letters, Protons and Paradoxes," a book that seeks to reopen a perspective into the world of antiquity and its languages, which has been generally hidden, disregarded and overlooked for more than 120 years. In this program, Vahan explains Armenia as a root for human civilization and languages. He tells about skewed studies of history and how Indo-Aryan civilization and language migrated from the Caucasus and the Armenian highlands to other parts of the world. He outlines linguistic connections to other ancient high cultures. We'll also discuss Armenian pre-Christian traditions and what happened when monotheism arrived with violence and bloodshed. In the second hour, we speak about the neglected atrocities of the Armenian Genocide. Setyan talks about the Ottoman Empire, the Young Turks and those who were pulling the strings behind the scenes and organizing these atrocities. Is there an ancient tribal war being waged to this day? Later, we discuss how Armenia and Europe alike are facing massive problems with Islam and what needs to occur for us to reawaken to our ancient heritage.

Swedish street artist Dan Park faced two prison sentences because of his provocative street art. He was accused of denigration of "folkgrupp," which is the Swedish term for specially protected segments of the population, such as Muslims, Gypsies, homosexuals and women -- but not the original Swedes nor men in general. Both sentences were given for the same pictures. During the first court case, Park had uploaded pictures on his blog to tell his fans what was going on - before any sentence was given. He received another prison sentence for doing that. The court thought that Park had to be locked up because he was having a high risk of repeating the "crime." The prosecutor even demanded a psychiatric assessment to be performed on Park. Dan will tell his story of being jailed for his artwork in a country that professes to uphold freedom of speech. We'll discuss how any viewpoint that opposes the left is deemed offensive and racist. Dan points out the hypocrisy and lies coming out of "tolerant" Sweden. Left violence against Nationalists and free speech is rampant. Henrik R�uist, an art gallery owner who shows Dan's artwork and also Lars Vilks, who has received death threats for his drawings of Muhammad, also joins the conversation. Since he has shown the artwork of Dan and Lars Vilks, he has been threatened, harassed, had his emails hacked, lost friends and does not go out after dark in fear of his life. We'll talk about art censorship, Sweden's fascist society and the union of the left with Islam in all its contradictions.

Harry Cooper is the founder and President of Sharkhunters International, an organization dedicated to U-boats and World War II history. The group was started in 1983 and today the organization has around 7,800 members in 76 countries. The organization professes to include some high profile political and military members. Cooper is a military veteran, former race car driver and expert in WWII and National Socialist (Nazi) history. We'll discuss the formation of Sharkhunters and the compelling evidence regarding Hitler's escape to South America, that came from a Spanish spy named Don Angel Alcazar de Velasco. Angel's testimony included a 114-page, single-spaced letter that told of his experiences in the "F�unker" with Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun. Alcazar claims to have witnessed the couple forcibly drugged under orders of Party Chancellery Martin Bormann, then removed from the bunker and taken to South America. We proceed to discuss the escape route and how they ended up on the Brazilian island Trindade and how they set up consequent villages and small towns in South America. Cooper tells us of the many witnesses he encountered in his travels to South America, and those who have claimed to have seen Hitler alive and well after the war. Harry also visited the house in Patagonia, Argentina where it's said that Hitler lived for many years. Cooper asserts that the intelligence community knew that Hitler did not die in Germany. The FBI and CIA allegedly knew Hitler was living in Argentina from 1945 onward. Later, we discuss Villa Baviera (Colonia Dignidad), the Nazi Bell and the Neu Schwabenland Antarctica expedition.

Returning guest, Jon Rappoport is an investigative journalist, author and publisher of the website nomorefakenews.com. He has worked as an investigative reporter for 30 years, writing articles on politics, medicine, and health. Although his main focus over these years has been the power of the imagination and creativity, he is most often cited and interviewed on conspiracies and global elites. In this program, we'll explore Snowden. Who is he and what's really going on? We'll also take a closer look at his favored journalists and talk about what he's doing in Russia. Jon also discusses how the NSA wants to know how their spying is affecting us and in what ways. The thought police is here. Facebook has admitted to saving everything you type, even if you don't publish it. They want to know what you are self-censoring. We'll discuss how people have been conditioned to self censor. In the second hour, we'll discuss the L.A. Clippers' Donald Sterling controversy and how this was a possible psyop. Jon explains how our language is "shrinking" and we are being taught to police ourselves. We'll talk about how political correctness is creating wimps in a society of "friendly fascism." Later, we talk about the power of comedy to rid of the social stigma associated with certain words.

Richard Dolan is a researcher, author, and public speaker on the topic of UFOs and related matters. He earned a Bachelor's degree in History and English Literature at Alfred University, then earned a Master's degree in History at the University of Rochester. He also received a Certificate in Political Ideologies from Exeter College at Oxford University, and was a finalist for a Rhodes Scholarship. Since publishing his books on the subject of UFOs starting in 2000, Richard has travelled throughout the U.S. and world speaking to audiences. In the first hour, we'll discuss how UFO knowledge is at the heart of America's black budget. We talk about how UFO knowledge has been privatized and speculate on the players in this secret agenda. Richard talks about the possibility of other intelligences who are involved. If a breakaway civilization exists, what does that mean? It might be possible that the "others" are from a more advanced civilization with a human population. Brad Sorenson, of Lockheed Martin, stated that they "were capable of doing light speed or better." Don't miss the second hour as we discuss the cult like fanaticism surrounding UFOs. Richard explains how we are dealing with "complex realities" that at times also involves the government. We'll discuss how the new age movement has clouded the UFO field, somewhat akin to how the rock n' roll of the 60s was used by the CIA to stop the peace movement. Richard talks about how the new age movement is a grand distraction from what we should be focusing on. We'll talk about socially engineered pacification, the guru effect and much more.

Joseph P. Farrell has a B.A. in Biblical Studies and Philosophy, an M.A. in Historical and Theological Studies, and a Ph.D. in Patristics from the University of Oxford. He pursues research in physics, alternative history, science and "strange stuff." He's the author of many fascinating books in the field of alternative research. In this program, we discuss the upcoming Secret Space Program conference and his books, "Covert Wars and Breakaway Civilizations" and "Covert Wars and the Clash of Civilizations." Farrell begins discussing how a secret space program hypothetically developed beginning in 1947 up till today. We'll discuss black budgets, development of technology and the reasoning behind a breakaway civilization. Joseph says that the perception on the part of the national security apparatus that some UFO activity was hostile, and concerned with nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, plus the secret collateralization of space resources in the hidden system of finance, may have led to the perception that humanity was once again at a "tower of babel moment" in history. Farrell argues that this in turn required calculated responses to the UFO in the form of a kind of gunboat diplomacy. In the second hour, we talk about the strange geopolitical moves pertaining to issues of wars, mass surveillance, the NSA, corporate takeovers and moves toward global world government. We'll question the tie between politics and the secret space program. Later, we discuss the increase of funding that we've seen being poured into the private space sector and how this might alter the current trajectory.

Paul Craig Roberts has had careers in scholarship and academia, journalism, public service, and business. Roberts is probably best known for being the Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury for Economic Policy in the Reagan Administration.

He is the author of numerous books, including his most recent, How America Was Lost: From 9/11 to the Police/Warfare State. He is currently chairman of The Institute for Political Economy. In this program, we discuss the neo-con's war agenda and how the Ukraine fits into the Wolfowitz doctrine. We talk about the violent Coup d'鴡t in Kiev and who has been the driving factor behind the illegitimate takeover of the country. Paul also discusses the inconsistencies in the various political factions that have been helping each other in order to take control of the Ukraine. Washington's willingness to work with anyone, including criminals, in order to achieve their goals is no big surprise but is speaks volumes about their ambitions to remain in power. Later, we discuss Putin's Russia and how vastly different the roles are today, than just 25 years ago and what the grudge between the west's elite and Russia is about. Paul explains how the USA is losing more and more influence around the world. He paints a picture of no more superpowers and what power dynamic will replace it. Later, we discuss the future of the American dollar, multicultural madness in Europe and the next step in the geopolitical chess game.

Elizabeth Holgrave is an independent researcher of pre-Christian European Spiritual Traditions. She has studied Judeo-Christian religion, Kabbalah, Traditional Witchcraft and the ancestral traditions and pre-Christian spiritual practices of the Celtic and Germanic peoples in a life-long search for her spiritual roots. Her search has led her through the depths of Christianity, Wicca, and Judaism until finally finding her spiritual home in Germanic Heathenism and the traditions of her ancestors. We'll discuss the traditions and beliefs of Germanic Heathenism. An important aspect of Heathenism is veneration of ancestors, a tradition that has been lost to most Europeans. Elizabeth shares various sources for pagan folklore, fairytales, mythology and tradition. We'll talk about returning to our ancient pre-Christian practices and discuss why it's important. As multiculturalism seeks to devour western countries and European heritage, we'll speak about how to recover and integrate ancient traditions into our modern world in order to ground and unite Europeans both culturally and spiritually. We also discuss the unnatural politically correct ideas of no gender, no race and one shared global culture for humanity. Later, Elizabeth explains how many Europeans revert to Christianity when times get hard, looking for power and strength, yet this is playing right into the elite's hands.

Ramzpaul is known for his iconoclastic YouTube show that mocks cultural Marxism, mostly satire that pokes fun at the establishment. In the first hour, we'll discuss why ethnicity is important and how it stands in the way of the elite. We laugh at stupid things fanatically politically correct people say and the absurd notion of a one size fits all approach. Ramzpaul explains why he's a nationalist for everyone and how it can solve conflicts. We'll talk about foisted White guilt and the ridiculousness of "White privilege." Paul shares what he believes is at the root of "White guilt." In the second hour, we'll discuss how multiculturalism is creating unnecessary conflict. Cultural Marxists are waging war on reality, pushing their religion of egalitarianism. Ramzpaul speaks about nationalism as a way to preserve diversity. Later, we discuss being brave to speak out against the lies and hypocrisy and to stop self censorship in fear of being labeled the "r" word. At the end, Ramzpaul shares his opinion on how multiculturalism will play out.

D.M. Murdock, also known by her pen name, "Acharya S," is the author of several books on comparative religion and mythology, including "The Christ Conspiracy," "Suns of God," "Who Was Jesus?" and "Christ in Egypt." Murdock is an alumna of Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA, where she studied Classics, Greek Civilization. She has lived in Greece and is also an alumna of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Greece. She speaks, reads and/or writes to varying degrees English, French, Spanish, ancient and modern Greek, Latin, German and other languages. Acharya S has gained expertise in several religions, as well as knowledge about other esoterica and mystical subjects. In the first hour, we'll discuss her latest research "Did Moses Exist? The Myth of the Israelite Lawgiver." Although many scholars today are clear on the mythical nature of the Exodus tale and the probable (to them) non-historicity of the Moses character, there are a number of historical or quasi-historical individuals and events that have gathered attention as the possible "real Moses" and "real Exodus." In the second hour, we'll look deeper into the origins of the Jewish tribe, Yahweh and the Ten Commandments. She provides comparative mythology or mythical motifs also found in other cultures that relate to the Moses myth, the Ark of the Covenant and more. She'll talk about the profound correspondences between the tales of Moses and the Greek god Dionysus. We'll also talk about Yahweh supremacy and the foisted idea of the "chosen people." Later, we'll talk about the danger of disconnecting from our ancestral cultural heritage and how it creates a hatred of the natural world and disconnects us from nature. Our ancestors maintained tradition and mythology for important reasons. The Arahamic religions have swept across European countries, replacing imperative ancient myths with disastrous results. We discuss maintaining culture and heritage in a forced multicultural world. We'll talk about those who are attempting to override European shared heritage to replace it with something far worse.

Craig Fitzgerald is one of the founders of the National Anarchist Tribal Alliance of New York. We'll discuss the national anarchist movement and how it can be a solution to the problems we're facing. We'll discuss what a nation is and how it has nothing to do with government. As multiculturalism is being forced onto the west, we'll talk about the madness of mass immigration, cultural genocide and the government's involvement. Who is out to destroy western civilization? Craig elaborates on the culture wars and talks about radicalized extremists out to destabilize Europe. In the days of diversity being pushed down our throats, we'll talk about how true diversity comes with de-centralization and voluntaryism. We'll talk about the need for Europeans to move beyond the eastern Abrahamic religions and find their true heritage and roots found in Europe. Craig presents the idea of forming local communities and sovereign enclaves with like minded people to combat globalization, homogenization and government tyranny. Later, we talk about government infiltration of White nationalist groups. We'll also talk about the violence and hypocrisy of Antifa, a collective of militant so called anti-fascists. We'll end the hour on suppressed American history and megalithic sites that are hardly spoken about.

Petter Amundsen is an organist, a Freemason and co-author of the book Organisten (The Organist). Since 2002 he has decrypted a number of steganographic ciphers believed to be hidden in several first editions of William Shakespeare and Sir Francis Bacon's books. In 2003 Amundsen excavated two sites at the legendary Treasure Island -- Oak Island in Nova Scotia, Canada. His findings didn't go unnoticed as it attracted media attention and amazed many in the local community, among them landowner Dan Blankenship. In 2009, he was featured in a four episode TV series, Shakespeares skjulte koder (Shakespeare: The Hidden Codes) which broadcasted on Norwegian TV channel NRK1. In 2012 Amundsen published his second book, Oak Island & The Treasure Map in Shakespeare. In late April 2012 his full feature documentary "Shakespeare: The Hidden Truth" was released in Norwegian cinemas. In 2014, he was featured in an episode of History Channel's The Curse of Oak Island. In the first hour, Petter tells how he came to find secret messages in Shakespeare and how he learned to decrypt them. He'll discuss key elements and symbolism. We'll also discuss the controversy surrounding the authorship of Shakespeare, Francis Bacon, the Rosicrucians and how the ciphers lead to Oak Island in Canada. In the second hour, Petter explains how freemasonry helped him to decipher this mystery. He'll speak more about Oak Island's man made underground system, the finds, the excavations and its location, which is related to the constellation Cygnus. He'll also talk about the lamp, or the menorah and the Ark of the Covenant.

Andrei Znamenski studied history and anthropology both in Russia and the United States. Formerly a resident scholar at the Library of Congress, then a foreign visiting professor at Hokkaido University, Japan, he has taught at The University of Memphis and Alabama State University. His fields of interest include religions of indigenous people of Siberia and North America, shamanism, and esotericism. Znamenski is the author of Shamanism and Christianity (1999), Through Orthodox Eyes (2003), Shamanism in Siberia (2003), The Beauty of the Primitive: Shamanism and Western Imagination (2007), and the editor of the three-volume anthology Shamanism: Critical Concepts (2004). We'll discuss the dark side of Tibetan Buddhism and what lies behind this seemingly peaceful religion. Andrei discusses how Tibetan Buddhism became embraced by the west, specifically by leftists. He'll talk about how this eastern religion has been slyly integrated into politics to push ulterior motives by people such as the Dalai Lama, Karl Marx and the Bolsheviks and Stalin yet these themes continue today. We'll hear about how the west and the east exploited Shambhala to promote their fanatical schemes. In the second hour, Andrei explores the reason why Henry Wallace supported a "botanical expedition" (1934-1935) to Eastern China. To the surprise of his colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Wallace appointed as the head of this expedition, Russian painter and occultist Nicholas Roerich. Roerich used this as an opportunity to jump-start his utopian geopolitical project of the Sacred Union of the East - an attempt to bring all Tibetan Buddhist people of Inner Asia into a vast theocratic state that would become a spiritual beacon for all of humanity. Later, we discuss Wallace's idea to put the pyramid and eye on the dollar bill and the phrase Novus ordo seclorum. This New World Order is married to an ideology of new age collectivism.

In 1984 a Finnish man named Ior Bock came forward and told the world that his family, through thousands of years, passed down an ancient oral tradition -- The Family Saga from Str� Manor or as it's more commonly known "The Bock Saga." The saga explains the origin of man on earth and the origin of the Nordic culture that, according to the tradition, existed long before Babylon and Mesopotamia. Throughout three decades, before his tragic death in 2010, Ior Bock passed on his knowledge to a loyal group of people, consisting of Finns, foreigners, friends and students. One of those people was Michel Merle who joins us from Holland to talk about the story of Ior Bock and the Bock Saga. The tradition is a non-conventional history and chronology where the central mythology is found in root language, sounds and words. Merle met Ior Bock on the way back from India in 1975 and spent time with Ior and friends almost yearly in Goa and Finland. He has been learning about The Bock Saga since 1984 when it came out. He works as an international exhibition builder and painter to make a living. In the first hour, we discuss the expansion of the Roman Catholic Church into the northern lands and how the tradition went underground and kept within the Boxstr�amily. In the second hour, we speak about the excavation of the Temple of Lemmink䩮en, the largest so far discovered subterranean cave in Finland. According to the tradition, generations of Norse relics and artifacts have been found in the cave from thousands of years ago.

This is an exclusive interview with the White Rabbit behind the white genocide memes going around. You may have seen these memes such "Diversity is a code word for white genocide" or "Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white." For some Tim Murdock, who is White Rabbit Radio's Horus the Avenger, is a controversial person. You may have seen his animations on the web such as "How The Whites Took Over America" or "Anti-Racist Hitler" or "Johnny Racist." The White European western world and culture is under attack. We'll discuss how opposing forces have infiltrated the western system, controlling the message that controls the society. We'll discuss contradictions in the system and how the Soviet Union was taken down by its own contradictions. Tim talks about the agenda of revenge on European people ultimately seeking to create a non-white blended European. Zionist Jews have openly stated their leading role at the center of this multicultural society. We'll talk about the plan to reduce Whites to a minority through various tactics, while not allowing them to have an exclusive homeland. The use of weaponized words, political correctness and double standards are predictably heard in media, entertainment and education to war against Whites, especially children. Later, we discuss how Russia, China and Iran stand in the way of multiculturalism and world hegemony. Lastly, we talk about a growing movement of well rounded people who break the mainstream stereotype of a White nationalist.

Mikkel Clair Nissen is an anti-collectivism activist and author of the book, Manipulism and the Weapon of Guilt: Collectivism Exposed, a controversial expos頡nd carefully detailed description of the awful emotional mind game that facilitates communism, socialism, and social-liberalism, known as collectivism. The book exposes Denmark, the supposed happiest nation on earth, for what it truly is: collectivism's biggest propaganda hoax. Danish author Mikkel Clair Nissen tells the hidden facts and realities of life in Denmark's democratic-socialism that they don't want you to know. We'll hear about how he began waking up to the dark side of Denmark. Like a dysfunctional family, Danes are terribly insecure, compulsively corrected, policed, and regularly intimidated by each other. Known in psychology as pathological narcissism, these behaviors are a way of everyday life. He'll talk about life in the collective within Scandinavian society. In the second hour, Mikkel elaborates on the psychology of what drives the Nordic society. We'll discuss what is known in Nordic societies as "Jante Law," which contains 10 rules. He talks about psychopathic narcissism and how inferiority makes superiority complex. Nissen also explains how the Nordic model has achieved neo-communism. Nordic people even turn on family and friends to defend the state. Later, he talks about how to bring children up to not be part of the pathological collective. In the collective, there is no such thing as individual achievement. Later, Mikkel talks about how this same type of collective is now threatening the US.

Maria takes a historical and spiritual approach to Old Norse myths and legends and considers them on par with other classical philosophical principles. We'll begin on the ancient Norse lifestyle of both men and women, including the ranking system. Maria explains how shamanism has an important place in Norse mythology. She'll point out symbolism found in Norse stories and art that is also seen in other mythologies around the world. In the second hour, we'll discuss the Vikings, who travelled far and wide. We'll talk about how Viking raids began in retaliation of Roman Christian aggression. She'll talk about the destruction of pagans and their fight to ward off Christian invasion, which also included Norse sorcery. As the Vikings were scattered, we'll discuss where they went. We'll also hear about hierarchy and the expectations of a man within the Viking society. Later, Maria discusses Norse cosmology and elaborates more on Norse myths that are conveyed in poems, riddles and tales.

Zoltan Istvan is an American-Hungarian philosopher, journalist, entrepreneur, and futurist. He has explored over 100 countries—many as a journalist for the National Geographic Channel—writing, filming, and appearing in dozens of television stories, articles, and webcasts. He also pioneered and popularized the extreme sport of volcano boarding. Zoltan later became a director for the international conservation group WildAid, to stop illegal wildlife trade in Southeast Asia. He recently published The Transhumanist Wager, a controversial fictional thriller describing apatheist Jethro Knights and his unwavering quest for immortality via science and technology. As a leading transhumanist, Zoltan presents his reasons for being in favor of humanity merging with machine. He'll discuss his view that technology will improve on nature. Overcoming morality is his greatest concern. We'll discuss body harm from new technologies and the ethical dilemmas they present. Zoltan argues that ultimately technology will be helpful to the "greater good" and must be implemented, even if by force and even if there are causalities along the way. In the second hour, Zoltan philosophizes about technology as evolution and luck as the prime mover of the human experience. He talks about maximizing on the transhumanist value for the evolution of our species. We parallel transhumanism with religious thinking. He'll speak in favor of controversial subjects such as a transhumanist dictatorship, population control, licenses to have children and people needing to justify their existence in front of a committee, much like the Fabian Socialist George Bernard Shaw's idea. He says we must use the expedient method to lead to the transhumanist society. At the end, Henrik talks about covert eugenics and ties it into technology.

M.K. Lords is the office manager at Roberts & Roberts Brokerage and a part time agorist. She is committed to building bridges with a variety of activists to create a freer world. When she's not busy expressing her own freedom through spoken word poetry or fire dance, she is busy educating others about the effectiveness of counter-economics as a way to redistribute power back into the hands of the people. Her articles have been featured in Bitcoin Magazine, Freedom's Phoenix and Attack the System. M.K. will explain the political philosophy known as agorism, named by Samuel Edward Konkin III. Agorism encourages people to withdraw their consent from the state by devoting their economic activities to black market and grey market sources, which would not be taxed or regulated. M.K. discusses how via revolutionary market anarchism, we can achieve a free society. We'll also discuss Bitcoin and Dark Wallet. Then, we'll talk about political correct madness as Bitcoin has been accused of being racist and sexist. Also discussed is the Libertarian Party's view of limited government vs. the anarchist view of no state. Is America heading for more govn't tyranny or will the younger generation rise up and fight the state?

A CBN News veteran, Dale Hurd began his journalism career in 1982 at a daytime only AM radio station in Kalamazoo, Mich. In 1987 he joined the CBN Radio Network as a program host and news anchor. Dale has reported extensively from Western Europe, as well as China, Russia, and Central and South America. Dale's first foreign assignment to Moscow in 1991 was just months before the eventual breakup of the Soviet Union. It remains his favorite stint. "It was clear to me, as soon as we landed in 1991, that the Soviet Union was finished," he says. Dale also covered China's opening to capitalism in the early 1990s, as well as the Yugoslav Civil War. Since 9/11, Dale has reported extensively on various aspects of the global war on terror in the United States and Europe. In this program, we'll discuss the restrictions of free speech in Sweden and the extremely narrow political spectrum in Scandinavia. The media is controlled by the left only perspective. A different perspective is seldom heard. When it is, it is fiercely demonized usually as hate speech. A very effective measure to control population is through economic policy and the Nordic model has perfected this art like no other. We'll compare the American system to Sweden and how they are beginning to become more similar with each other. Dale addresses the program of mass immigration into Scandinavia and Europe and the consequences of the growth of Islam as the west, and Scandinavia in particular, is entering a spiritual vacuum where atheism and scientism has become the new state religion. Hurd also talks about the 68ers and misdirected idealism. Lastly, we discuss US foreign policy.

Ricardo Duchesne teaches sociology and world history at The University of New Brunswick, Saint John, Canada. His publications include one book, 45 refereed articles, one chapter, 13 encyclopedia entries, and 18 non-refereed articles. His book, The Uniqueness of Western Civilization, a major work of 528 pages, was released in February 2011. Currently he is doing research on multiculturalism and the identity crisis of the West. We'll discuss how in recent decades, the field of world history has been relentless in its downgrading of the idea of Western uniqueness in pursuit of a multicultural point of view. Ricardo Duchesne calls into question much of the scholarly research seeking to justify an anti-Eurocentric spirit and counter-critiques the revisionist movement. We'll talk about how the revisionist movement strongly disapproves of anyone who might suggest that the West is exceptional or that it blazed a special path in history, although humanity has gained much from the unique heritage of Western cultural and intellectual journey. We'll continue in the second hour, with the concentrated efforts to destroy western culture as it doesn't fit in with the New World Order's egalitarian ways. We'll address how academia accuses the west of only exploitation, racism and colonization, claiming that the west became rich from robbing others. Then, we'll discuss how people today are disconnected from their ancestors and lack the understanding of what it took to create modern society. Later, Ricardo talks about the multicultural push onto European countries and the double standards held upon western civilization. The hour ends on the relationship between socialists and capitalists and who is really using who?

Mark McCandlish is an artist who has specialized in aviation and conceptual art within the defense and aerospace industries for the better part of the last thirty years, serving the needs of many American corporations in this regard. His first UFO sighting occurred at Westover Air Force Base in the State of Massachusetts, in the winter of 1966 and he observed the craft through an 80 power telescope for about ten minutes before it accelerated out of sight at an extreme velocity. He later discovered that this craft had been hovering above a flight of nuclear-armed Boeing B-52's sitting on the Alert Ramp of the flight line on base. Mr. McCandlish has spent most of his life trying to discover the science that would make such incredible performance possible. Having had literally dozens of sightings since 1966, he feels certain that this carefully protected technology has been co-opted by an as-yet-unknown group, and the sequestration of this technology has provided that organization tremendous leverage in world politics, finance and international conflicts over the past five decades. In the first hour, Mark shares what he believes is a plausible answer to interstellar flight. We'll talk about propulsion systems, US modification experiments, zero point energy and the side effect of trapping it. In the second hour, Mark shares an interesting story of one contactee who was then abducted by the military who was trying to acquire alien technology found inside of the contactee. This abductee also predicted future events that have all come to pass, except for one. Later, we'll talk about offworld exploration. Who is going and why? Mark emphasizes the positive angle to offworld exploration.

Michael Schratt is a private pilot/military aerospace historian and has lectured across the USA on the unique subject of "mystery aircraft," and classified propulsion systems buried deep within the military industrial complex. Michael talks about the evidence that supports the claim that elements within the military industrial complex (specifically the American aerospace industry) have designed, built and tested flown saucer shaped aircraft which mimic the form, fit and function of that as we perceive to be extraterrestrial UFOs. In this program, we discuss the black budget, off black budget and special access programs that have laid the financial groundwork for those who have been developing secret aerospace megaprojects. We'll speak about military contractors such as Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin & McDonnell Douglas and their endless funding for their project. In hour two, we continue to discuss the development of "saucer" technology and some of the alternative propulsion systems like magnetic field disruptors and electrogravitics. We also speak more about Leonard Stringfield and the "Retrievals of the Third Kind. " Later, we talk about who is running the program and for what reason. Michael mentions the insiders who claim they've been working on these black ops programs.

Catherine Austin Fitts is the Founder and President of Solari. She served as Managing Director and Member of the Board of Directors of the Wall Street investment bank, Dillon, Read & Co., Inc. She also served as Assistant Secretary of Housing/Federal Housing Commissioner at HUD in the first Bush Administration and was the President and Founder of Hamilton Securities Group, Inc. We'll discuss if financial fraud and market manipulations are actually mechanisms for financing the black budget and if centralized governance is necessitated by high-tech secrecy. There may be as much as $100 trillion dollars worth of hardware flying the skies powered by anti-gravity and field-propulsion technologies. This has significant implications for the ownership and design of manufacturing and energy infrastructure on planet earth. It also has connections to trillions of dollars which are "missing" from defense and domestic agency accounts (as reported by official financial reports of the US government). To the extent that the US taxpayer has financed this technology (or its reverse-engineering) why should private corporations own it on a secret basis? The financial fortunes and geopolitical power involved are significant. If you control these technologies, you possess weaponry sufficient to engineer a financial coup d'Etat and to centralize control of the entire global financial system. In the member's hour, we'll speak more on UFOs, the expansion of the control grid and trails of the black budget.

John B. Wells is the host of the radio show, Caravan to Midnight. He is an actor, musician, writer, investigative journalist, composer, martial artist, aviator and broadcaster. John also performed weekend duties as the host of the nationally syndicated overnight radio show Coast to Coast AM. We'll begin the hour with John discussing his recent exit from Coast to Coast AM and monster corporate media outlets such as Clear Channel. For some radio programs, the only thing safe to talk about is that which can't be proven. John talks about how information is being used as a weapon. Then, we'll talk about how patriotic, pro-US Constitution Americans are being marked as a threat while the nation tumbles into the ultimate sacrifice for the "common good." John explains how globalists are making the world into one giant country for nefarious reasons. Later, we discuss how mainstream media, although tanking in numbers and credibility with the public, is still able to stay on. In the second hour, John shares his views on Russia and Putin. Is Putin possibly seeking revenge for Wall Street bankers who funded the Bolshevik Revolution that killed millions of Russians? We'll also talk about the mysterious Obama who has many names. Is his father the communist activist Frank Marshall Davis? Later, we discuss how the powers that be need division between the races and continue to use slavery as a weapon.

Vincent Freeman is a molecular biologist and artificial intelligence scientist who has worked on classified programs at some of the top-50 defense contractors. He has also conducted genetic and biological analysis for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Vincent is currently volunteering his time as a senior consultant to the Carnicom Institute, a non-profit research organization whose goal is to identify and expose covert geo-engineering and bio-engineering. Vincent will discuss his current project that involves 'reverse-engineering' the fundamental structural biology involved in the 'chemtrails' pathogen. He is working closely with Clifford Carnicom to accomplish this task. Vincent will explain the biological evidence they have and explain the eerie properties of cross domain bacteria, a type of genetically engineered bacteria/nanomachine. In the second hour, we'll discuss Morgellons disease and how the population is already exposed and infected regardless of whether they have symptoms or not. He explains how infection can be proven via multiple scientific methods and what can be done to inhibit Morgellons growth. Also, Vincent discusses where CI is going in terms of research. Later, we discuss the evidence of covert bio-engineering and nanotechnology and how it works, as well as how these factors might play into the trans-humanist agenda.

Mark Gray has degrees in Chemistry, Nutrition, and Chiropractic. He has been looking at patterns and synchronicities in symbols, myth and numbers for almost 20 years. Some of his favorite research was in the US Capitol, which resulted in the book "Freedoms Gate: the Lost Symbols in the US Capitol," co-authored with investigative mythologist William Henry. We'll begin discussing 2014, the year of the horse and relevant horse themes found in pop-culture. He'll also discuss numbers and codes seen in pop-culture as well as trident symbolism at the Sochi Olympics. In the second hour, Mark speaks about four different codes that are "numerically switched" and "signs" to look for. He'll share symbolism related to the missing MH370 airplane going from Malaysia to China. We discuss how this event echoes 9/11. He relates flight MH370 to the TV show Lost and speculates on what may have happened to the 239 passengers. There are also hints that some have hijacked the plane to use it for later terrorist attacks, while blaming their opposition. Mark also talks about significant events and bombings that have taken place on July 22nd, suggesting the signatures of a false flag or an instigated event. Later, he talks about the latest Superman movie, Man of Steel which shows trident shaped spaceships crashing over the Indian Ocean. The hour ends on potential future insight that can be made to understand what can be forecasted using numbers.

Stephen A. McNallen is a prominent religious leader of the native European path called Asatro. McNallen established the first legally recognized Asatro organization in the US in 1972 and quickly became a prolific writer and speaker on the subject on Germanic Paganism, which broadly includes the ancient tribes of Northern Europe. He believes that spiritual fulfillment is best achieved by following the ways of one's ancestors. This ancestral approach to Asatro has put him at odds with many who insist on a universalist worldview. He's also a proponent of "upward evolution" for the individual and the group, encouraging others to incorporate daily spiritual practice in their lives. The Asatru Folk Assembly (AFA), is the most active and successful national group in the U.S., holding major gatherings on both coasts each year plus dozens of regional events around the country. The AFA is international in scope with members in the UK, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, Spain, South America, and Australia. In the first hour, we'll discuss Christianity's invasion of Europe and Viking rage caused by missionaries. We talk about the misconceptions and vicious stereotyping of the Vikings, who were sophisticated people. Stephen discusses the belief system of Asatro, an expression of the native, pre-Christian spirituality of Europe. He speaks about Europe's loss of soul, caused by the disconnection with Indo-European ancestors, and the importance to reawaken that ancestral wisdom. In the second hour, we speak about the Vatican's hold of Europe and what might occur if Europeans do not integrate their ancient native religion into this century. We'll also hear about runestones and more spiritual concepts found in Norse mythology. Later, we talk about the slaughter of Norse people, suppressed European mythology and the re-emergence of the ways of old that existed for thousands of years in Europe before the invasion of Christianity.

Mark Weber is an American historian, author, lecturer and current affairs analyst with a specialized knowledge of US foreign policy, international relations, the Second World War, and, more broadly, of twentieth-century European and American history. Weber is also director of the Institute for Historical Review, an independent, public interest research and publishing center in southern California. In 1988 Weber testified for five days in Toronto District Court as a recognized expert on Germany's wartime Jewish policy and the Holocaust issue. In the first hour, Mark talks about a known terrorist group - the Jewish Defense League -- who for 3 months impacted IHR's finances by shutting down the Institute's processing of credit card orders and donations. Behind the shutdown was Dov Hikind. We'll discuss the monopoly and blatant double standards of Jewish organizations such as the JDL, ADL and SPLC. Then, Mark talks about the dangers of applying morality to politics, used to justify war and takeover. Weber also speaks about current ethnic and culture clashes, although we're being told these are just superficial constructs. In the second hour, we'll discuss the situation in Ukraine. Weber shares his perspective on the situation. Next, we'll talk about Germany's role in the EU. Weber talks about Germany's current climate and we look back to WWII. Was there a conspiracy to crush Germany? Mark talks about Winston Churchhill's involvement, the European balance of power at that time and those who wanted to destroy the strength of the German people. We also hear about the horrific bombing in Dresden that massacred thousands of innocent Germans and how it was justified. Innocent German women were also raped and beaten by Western and Soviet soldiers. Weber explains the propaganda version of "the good war." We end the hour on America's military industrial war complex and its worldwide reach into foreign policy. Mark talks about America's abstract ideas that have no interest for Americans and how the US is now exporting ideologies, such as gay rights, with no respect for other cultures or policies.

Sofia Smallstorm is known for her research on 9/11, which culminated in the documentary 9/11 Mysteries. She is also known for her research on the connection between chemtrails and synthetic biology. With Sofia, we'll explore a different angle of engineering popularly called "futurism." Synthetic biology is the new frontier of science, combining genetics, robotics and nano-technology with artificial intelligence, hybridizing natural forms and engineering tissues beyond our wildest dreams. What is the deep agenda behind this science? Sofia talks about the presence of Morgellons disease in humans, which illustrates what nanotechnology is capable of. She also elaborates on the scope of planetary engineering and how much of planetary life it includes. We'll hear about radiation biology and bacteria by the name of deinococcus radiodurans that may be important to transhumanists in the near future. In the second hour, Sofia speaks more about the explosion of cellular technology and synthetic biology and how these may be used to create life forms and change the world as we know it. How would our world be organized then? Will we turn ourselves over to machines or will we become technological hybrids?

In this program, we'll speak with Guje B�sson from Sweden who has been investigating the death of her daughter Annie B�sson since she was found dead on Ayrshire beach close to Prestwick airport in Scotland on December 4th, 2005. A police investigation team quickly ruled out suspicious circumstances or foul play surrounding her death and suggested the probability of suicide, almost immediately. A post-mortem report indicated that the cause of death was drowning and the police concluded she had either taken her own life or died as the result of an accident. There have been a number of strange inconsistencies and coincidences surrounding this case, which has given Guje the motivation to investigate herself for over 8 years, to prove that her daughter didn't kill herself. Annie's mother has been trying to get the Scottish authorities to reopen the case in order to find out what really happened. Annie's case was classified as secret in November 2006 in accordance with Freedom of Information Act. Documentation cannot be revealed since Annie's death is not "in the public interest" and Guje has been denied access to the investigation. Guje will talk about what she believes happened, including speculations of mistaken identity, the CIA and a rendition flight out of Prestwick airport. Later, we also talk with justice campaigner and petitioner to the Scottish Parliament Tom Minogue. He tells how he's been helping Guje to shed light on the secrecy surrounding the case. He also speaks about Scotland's justice system that has enabled this to become a long, drawn out and difficult process for Guje.

Returning guest, Patrick Henningsen is an author and founder of the 21st Century Wire news website, an Associate Editor of alternative news site Infowars.com and regular geopolitical analyst for Russia Today. We'll begin discussing the absolute reality of globalists keeping the US and the west in a permanent state of war. Patrick talks about past revolutions and NGO's that prep the groundwork. Then, we'll talk about the misinformation surrounding Russia from anti-gay laws to Russia's desire to expand. This brings us to the situation in Ukraine. Patrick explains the history of Crimea and talks about why Russian military is really there, contrary to mainstream media reports. In the second hour, we'll discuss how people are being programmed to fear Russia, while all the while the US has military presence all over the world. Patrick explains the sensitive issues for those living in Crimea, Ukraine and Russia, specifically after WWII. We'll also talk about the great disconnect between the people and their political leadership and how politics is nothing about the voice of the people. Later, we discuss the RT news anchor, Liz Wahl, who quit the network on live television, as she said that "she came to see just how dangerous a propaganda tool the network was. I couldn't be a part of it any longer." Patrick talks about this false, manufactured claim. We end the hour on the missing plane flight MH370.

Dane Wigington has an extensive background in solar energy. He is a former employee of Bechtel Power Corp. and was a licensed contractor in California and Arizona. His personal residence was featured in a cover article on the world's largest renewable energy magazine, Home Power. He owns a 1,600-acre "wildlife preserve" next to Lake Shasta in northern California. Dane focused his efforts on the geo-engineering issue when he began to lose very significant amounts of solar uptake due to ever-increasing "solar obscuration" caused from aircraft spraying. He also noted significant decline in forest health and began testing and research into the geo-engineering issue about a decade ago. He is the lead researcher for geoengineeringwatch.org and has investigated all levels of geo engineering from chemtrails to HAARP. We'll discuss geoengineering, weather warfare, chemtrails and the collapse of civilization. Dane talks about the chemtrails spraying program and what compounds and particles are in it. Also, we discuss the global power struggle over the control of the weather and how it's being used as a weapon. In the second hour, we'll continue to speak about the recent cold snaps and how this has created an imbalance in global weather patterns. Dane also talks about the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor - the ITER - a new crazy experiment by scientists to create a star in a magnetic bottle. At the end, we tie in the global geopolitical game and the war on Russia.

Kevin MacDonald received his Ph.D. in Biobehavioral Sciences and is Professor of Psychology at California State University, Long Beach. MacDonald is the author of seven books on evolutionary psychology and child development and is the author or editor of over thirty academic articles. His research focuses on evolutionary psychology and on ethnicity and ethnic group conflict. He is the founder of The Occidental Observer, an online publication presenting original content touching on the themes of white identity, white interests, and the culture of the west. We'll cover how such a mission statement is sure to be dismissed as extremism of the worst sort in today's intellectual climate, even as a sign of psychiatric disorder. In the first hour, we discuss how multiculturalism asks us to behave as though ethnic conflict has never existed, yet it has been part of humanity's history for thousands of years. Yet, today only western countries are expected to become multicultural and open up their borders to massive non-white immigration. Kevin addresses the routine labeling of a "white supremacist" or "racist" as a means of muzzling white expression and interests. He'll talk about Jewish hostility of the West, those who want to see the demise of western culture and how it is being done. We'll hear how Europeans have been singled out and demonized as a "culture of slavery." In the second hour, we begin on the importance of a race to maintain a sense of culture and roots. Kevin then talks about pathological altruism to the point of self-abdication, unique to whites. We also discuss biological differences in races and how geology has made races evolve differently. Later, MacDonald points out the hypocrisy of those who are pro-multicultural. We'll speak more on The Frankfurt School and Jewish intellectuals, who have pushed their consensus to the west, although they do not base findings on empirical research. Later, we talk about Ukraine and the destruction of European nationalism. The hour ends on the need for Europeans to have a stronger sense of their own identity and interests without the imposed stigma.

He is well known for his trademark television performances of spoon bending. Gellar has been studied by the world's leading scientists and has worked with the FBI, CIA and Mussad. Uri has lectured to Prime Ministers, Presidents, United Nations delegates and CEOs of large multinational companies. We'll discuss the BBC film, "The Secret Lift of Uri Geller," which explores his work for intelligence agencies on three continents for 30 years. The program was based on newly declassified information, featured interviews with former intelligence personnel, and contained actual footage from CIA tests. We'll hear about the other side of Uri Geller, not the one camouflaged as an entertainer. Uri opens up about his abilities, how he does what he does and what kind of secret missions he worked on for government agencies around the world. We ask him why he is coming out publicly with this information. He'll talk about remote viewing, experiments at secret paranormal research labs and otherworldly entities. We also talk about the skeptics who try to debunk him. In the member's hour, we'll hear more about his work for the CIA and Mussad. Uri talks about psychics, intuitives and remote viewers being used for government intelligence. He says there is no doubt that UFOs, aliens and time travelers are all real. Later, we question the attack on 9/11. Geller gives his view on terrorism and his concern for a future nuclear attack.

He received an honorary Doctorate degree from Pacific International University for his work on Nephilim. L.A. and Brien return to discuss the mysterious elongated Parakus skulls of Peru. We'll hear about the skull sample test results and how the DNA mutations are unknown in any human, primate, or animal known so far. We are dealing with a new human-like creature, very distant from Homo sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans. Brien talks about what is known of the Paracus culture, while Lynn explains why he believes the skulls are remnants of the Nephilim. In the second hour, we'll go deeper into the Parakus culture. Is it possible they fled to North America? L.A. and Brien also discuss interesting genetic remnants of other ancient peoples. They'll talk about how information that challenges the mainstream record is silenced and covered up while the Darwinian model rules science. Later, Marzulli shares more information on the Nephilim.

David Icke has spent the last quarter of a century unraveling the secrets of the Universe, reality and the forces that manipulate our world. After writing more than 20 books, David Icke has driven on with his unrelentless investigation into subject areas that others don't dare touch. He returns to discuss his latest book, The Perception Deception, which is a massive work of 435,000 words, 900 pages and more than 800 illustrations. Icke lays out in dot-connected detail a lifetime of research and insight about our 'computer'-simulated reality, the holographic universe and the hidden non-human forces that are manipulating human life via hybrid bloodline families and networks into a global Orwellian state of total control. We'll discuss perception deception in various forms in our world. In the second hour, we'll continue with more on life in the archon manipulated world. David explains how we continue to feed the beast. He also weaves in transhumanism and how it is about making a collective human reality that supersedes organic collective consciousness. Icke expresses what it will take for humanity to stop unfolding a nightmare.

Description: Keith Preston received a B.A. in Religious Studies and an M.A. in History with additional graduate study in Sociology and Criminology. He is a former instructor of sociology, a former regional delegate for the Industrial Workers of the World and a former member of the National Committee of the Workers Solidarity Alliance. He is the founder and director of American Revolutionary Vanguard and the chief editor of AttacktheSystem.com. He is also the host of the "Attack the System" online podcast series. We'll discuss what Keith calls Anarcho-Pluralism and Pan-Secessionism. He'll talk about the core strategic efforts for the pan-anarchist movement. The idea is to work to abolish the central state and give every political interest group its own territory to create whatever kind of society it wishes. How do we go about dissolving the state? What are the methodologies for practical implementation of anarchism? What are the problems perceived in the mainstream of the anarchist milieu? How has mainstream Libertarianism failed? Keith explains how various types of anarchists can work together to crush the state and become an effective resistance. He will explain the real threat currently facing anarchism: totalitarian humanists, liberal humanism, progressive imperialism, cultural authoritarianism, tolerance of repression and political correctness have waged war on freedom. We speak more on how "radical localism" is the best possible method of avoiding tyrannies and abuses of Leviathan states. Anti-statism sentiments in America are becoming the norm. Will 21st century anarchists succeed in their efforts, or are we destined for tyranny?

Description: Barbara Peterson is behind the website Farmwars. She lives on a small ranch in Oregon where she raises geese, chickens, goats and horses, yet this rural lifestyle is currently under attack at the most basic level. Federal regulations, Agenda 21 and the corporate takeover of the US food supply with Monsanto's invasive GMO technology is designed to make it next to impossible to raise animals and grow organic food. In this program we have a somewhat laid back discussion about genetically modified foods, how to grow your own food and raising animals. Barbara also shares some recipes. We'll proceed in the second hour discussing GMO labeling campaigns and Prop 37. She suggests why it might not be such a good idea. Also, we talk about the individual solution against the government/corporate takeover of the food supply. Later, we discuss the "cautionary principle" in the EU in regards to the stance on GMOs. Europe is basicallymoving towards full implementationand government approval of GMO's, but at a slower pace.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Jon King - Hour 1 - The Conspiracy Behind the Assassination of Princess Diana
Date: 2014-02-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=zIyHutajFNY
Description: Jon King is a published author and optioned screenwriter with a background in music and journalism. For a good chunk of the 1990s and early 2000s he was editor of the popular high street magazines, UFO Reality and Odyssey, an enterprise which led to the publication of his first book, Cosmic Top Secret: The Unseen Agenda. He is probably best known for his two top-selling books Princess Diana: The Evidence and Princess Diana: The Hidden Evidence, with co-author John Beveridge. His latest book, The Cut-Out, is an autobiographical spy thriller based on the true story of how he was set up by MI6 in the cover-up operation that followed Princess Diana's death. In the first hour, we discuss the details of Princess Diana's assassination. In the second hour, Jon talks about how he was drawn into the conspiracy surrounding Diana's death and the unwitting role he became earmarked to play in the conspiracy. He speaks more about the source giving him information about a "high profile" assassination that was to occur. King also details how the MI6 and CIA have been seeking to use non-mainstream press and media in order to have them disseminate information. This has been done in an effort to try to ridicule these stories as rumors and crazy conspiracy theories, despite the core of truth in the information shared. This gives us an interesting insight into how security agencies work and that insiders, anonymous sources and whistleblowers might still be in the business of doing the bidding of the agencies they claim they are speaking out against.

Title: Red Ice Radio - William Mullen - Hour 1 - Origin of Hieroglyphics & Plasma Cosmology
Date: 2014-02-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=J9mNPk84oR0
Description: Mullen received his BA in Classics from Harvard. He was a Professor or post-doctoral Fellow at Berkeley, Princeton, Boston University and Harvard's Center for Hellenic Studies and St. John's College. Mullen settled in the Classics Department at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, in 1985. Many catastrophist theories use hieroglyphics from around the world for clues about shapes in the ancient sky that are no longer visible. Dr. Mullen focuses on Egyptian hieroglyphics as relevant to the Saturn and polar configuration theory. By studying those hieroglyphs which bear no obvious resemblance to things seen today, and by reading them in context, he will show which glyphs are the best clues to what our early ancestors experienced. In this program, we discuss Velikovsky, catastrophe and plasma cosmology as the origins of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. Catastrophe spawned the myths and stories that inspired the making of the first petroglyphs and rock art as a kind of "proto-hieroglyphs." Mullen tells how he has been attempting to crack the code of the pyramid texts and how it relates to the Saturn polar configuration. In the second hour, Bill talks about Anthony Peratt, who has identified 81 plasma shapes. We'll also discuss what other hieroglyphs are rooted in these shapes that were visible in the ancient sky. Later, we'll hear about catastrophe and great migration periods that lead to both violent invasions and cultural mingling. At the end, Bill briefly speaks about the Baltic origin of the Homeric epic.

Description: Sofia Smallstorm is known for her research on 9/11, which culminated in the documentary 9/11 Mysteries. She is also noted for the tie-in between chemtrails and synthetic biology. The Sandy Hook shootings caught her interest because the story has expanded like a giant artificial cloud since its inception. Sofia is known for connecting the dots with rich graphics and narration. She continues to research a variety of topics, and she shares much of her findings and opinions in her monthly newsletter, Avatar Update. We'll discuss her presentation, "Unraveling Sandy Hook in 2, 3, 4 and 5 Dimensions." On December 14, 2012 , just seven days before the winter solstice, a lone young gunman caused havoc at a Connecticut elementary school. The Sandy Hook shootings were a potboiler, setting off a nationwide debate over gun control. But is this all that will ensue? From photo analysis to ballistics to medical protocol to unseen bodies and weak excuses, the story doesn't add up. She'll discuss this bizarre story that has more than one dimension. Sophia explains how this event unravels a spooky story involving Fairfield County residents, the Baha'i Faith, CIA, collectivism and the making of a new kind of town. In hour two, Sophia ties in the creation of a post-human society and the current altering of humanity. We continue on several oddities surrounding the Sandy Hook shooting event. Sofia brings together Newtown, the New World Order and the development of a new kind of human.

Description: Robert Felix, a former architect, became interested in the ice-age cycle back in 1991. He spent the next eight and a half years, full-time, researching and writing about the coming ice age. Since then he has been dedicated to speaking about this research. Robert is the author of Not by Fire But By Ice and Magnetic Reversals and Evolutionary Leaps. In the first hour, we discuss solar cycles and how they coordinate with ice ages and collapses of civilizations. Felix explains why he is convinced that the next ice age has already begun. Now even mainstream scientists are warning that the sun has "gone to sleep." We'll discuss the last Maunder Minimum in the 1600's, which was responsible for the Little Ice Age and lasted for 70 years. We are at a real risk of seeing a return of such conditions. Robert explains what an ice age would entail. In the second hour, we talk about the increasing propane and electricity prices as we are experiencing the lowest temperatures since 1918. Then, we'll discuss magnetic pole reversals that match up with ice age cycles. Robert shares his theory on how evolutionary leaps can take place during a magnetic reversal. He presents an explanation for certain mysteries surrounding extinction events and the appearances of new species. Later, we hear about the 500 year orbital stretch cycle also due at this time. At the end, Robert talks about how ice ages come on suddenly and he mentions what to look out for.

Description: William Lyne was born in Big Spring, Texas and raised in West Texas oil boom towns and ranching country. His bio states that he had a Top Secret clearance in Air Force Intelligence, earned a B.S. degree with a double major in Art and Industrial Technology from Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas, acquired an M.F.A. in Studio Arts from the University of Texas at Austin in 1969, and has lived in New Mexico for over 28 years. In 1975, he rejected a high-paying and prestigious executive CIA position offered by then director George Bush, because he believes the National Security Act of 1947 is an illegal betrayal of American Sovereignty and liberty, and that the flying saucer, as man's greatest invention, should be enjoyed by all. In the first hour, we discuss occult ether physics and Tesla's hidden space propulsion system and the conspiracy to conceal it. He talks about how the secret government—a fraudulently concealed, unconstitutional, corporate-state entity—has controlled electropulsion technology by concealing it and other advanced free energy technology, on behalf of international, coercive, corporate-state monopolists. In the member's hour, we'll hear about the occult science dictatorship. William says powerful economic interests, which also control the government, the mass media and academic institutions, have used scientific thought-control for sinister means. This includes the invention of scientific and metaphysical theories that lead to nowhere. William shares his experiences with UFOs, which he says are man-made. He also talks about propaganda surrounding aliens, which is all part of a plot to conceal technology.

A graduate of NYU with degrees in journalism, film, and television, he has written and edited for the History Channel, the Arts & Entertainment Channel, PBS, Fox Television and Fox Films, ABC News, TNT, Paramount Pictures, and the Miami Herald. He lives in Vermont. We'll discuss his book, The Ancient Giants Who Ruled America. Drawing on 400 years of newspaper articles and photos, first person accounts, state historical records, and illustrated field reports, Richard J. Dewhurst reveals not only that North America was once ruled by an advanced race of giants but also that the Smithsonian has been actively suppressing the physical evidence for nearly 150 years. He'll discuss how thousands of giant skeletons have been unearthed at Mound Builder sites across the continent, only to disappear from the historical record. We'll hear about giant discoveries in locations such as Nevada, Florida, California and the ruins of the giants' cities with populations in excess of 100,000 in Arizona, Oklahoma, Alabama, and Louisiana. In the second hour, Dewhurst speaks more on the suppression of this evidence and the cover up. Today, ancient mounds have no official protection and are being bulldozed for parking lots. American Indians are preventing research of mounds, although they admit they did not build them. We'll hear about where some of the giants' bones are today. Richards also talks about an old, advanced nautical culture and ancient European migration to the USA. Later, we discuss the distorted picture of what America was like despite evidence of a coordinated social structure that celebrated making earth a sacred landscape, long before our arrival.

Her YouTube videos have reached more than 200,000 viewers in just a month. Her philosophy states that "Living outside the confines of unjust laws is necessary to living a just life." We'll discuss her work partnership with Larken Rose, their current project and the rise of true anarchism across the globe. She explains her philosophy of being an outlaw. We also question why there are so few outspoken female anarchists. Other topics we discuss include law, taxes, gun control and police brutality. As an anarchist, she shares her approach to mandatory licenses, insurance and permits. Josie explains why it is our duty to speak out against tyranny. We'll also discuss the ridiculous notion of the "greater good" and the rise of socialism. Only a stateless society is logically or morally compatible with non-aggression, self-ownership and voluntaryism because government is always coercive and violent.

Title: Red Ice Radio - David Talbott - Hour 1 - The Electric Universe & The Saturn Myth
Date: 2014-01-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=i_yOTaF23Ro
Description: David Talbott is a comparative mythologist whose work offers a radical new vantage point on the origin of ancient cultural themes and symbols. He is the author of The Saturn Myth and co-author with Wallace Thornhill of Thunderbolts of the Gods and The Electric Universe. David is the founder and director of The Thunderbolts Project. In the first hour, we return to the Thunderbolts Project and recap its prime mission, to explore the Electric Universe paradigm. David discusses elements of the electric universe such as the sun, the magnetic field and comets. We'll also talk about David's inspiration, Worlds in Collision written by Immanuel Velikovsky. The ancient record shows points in the sky that cross reference between cultures to reconstruct our past. In the member's hour, we continue on the nature of electricity. We also discuss symbols of Saturn. Talbott argues that the "Great God" or "Universal Monarch" of the ancients was not the sun, but Saturn, which once hung ominously close to the earth, and visually dominated the heavens. The first religious symbols were symbols of Saturn. Saturn's appearance at the time, radically different from today, inspired man's leap into civilization. Later, we discuss more celestial symbolism, mythology and cultural agreements.

Dr Zahi Hawass, ex Minister of State for Antiquities, revealed that "the robberies of King Khufu's cartouche was done on behalf of, Robert Bauval, an Egyptian Jew working in Belgium, who has been trying by every means to prove that the pyramid is a Jewish and not Egyptian product." Hawass claimed that Robert collaborated and paid two German amateur archaeologists to steal the cartouche of the pharaoh Khufu inside a relief chamber of the Great Pyramid. He added: "I would like to make it clear that the foreign vandals are led by an Egyptian Jew living in Belgium, who had previously sent more than one person, who were all forbidden completely, and with whom I have had many battles, and he wrote a book before trying to prove that the pyramid was not Egyptian." Hawass confirmed that "it was not permitted to enter the pyramid except through tourist companies in order to make control, which is the opposite of what is happing now; which allowed the samples to be smuggled." Robert, who is of the Christian Catholic faith, will address these false accusations.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Lisa Andersson - Hour 1 & 2 - When Swedish Tax Authorities Attack
Date: 2013-12-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vpnRev-a6Ag
Description: Lisa Andersson and her husband Micke Brandt run a construction company in Sweden. They were accused by the Swedish tax authorities of collaborating with other companies in a tax scheme. The accusation was based on what the authorities called "false invoices," although they had no evidence to support this accusation. In the process Lisa and her husband discovered that when dealing with authorities and courts in Sweden, one has almost no rights. They also realized that before the state courts their words and witnesses were less valid than the "evidence" or presumptions that the tax authorities presented. Struggling to not go bankrupt they have a long way to go to restore their business, to get out of debt and to regain what was lost before the tax authority's false accusations and attacks began. After two trials in the administrative court of Sweden they finally won. However in the process Lisa discovered that in Sweden, people serve the state, not the other way around. Despite paying one of the world's highest taxes, Swedish citizens are getting less and less in return from the state and the quality of those services is quickly dwindling.

Description: John W. Whitehead is an attorney and author who has written, debated and practiced widely in the area of constitutional law and human rights. Whitehead's concern for the persecuted and oppressed led him, in 1982, to establish The Rutherford Institute, a nonprofit civil liberties and human rights organization. Whitehead has filed numerous amicus briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court. He has also been co-counsel in several landmark Supreme Court cases. He joins us to discuss his book, A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American Police State. We'll discuss the shocking cases of police state brutality upon civilians, even upon children, the elderly and pregnant women. America was once a society that valued individual liberty and privacy. But in recent years it has turned into a culture that has quietly accepted surveillance cameras, police and drug-sniffing dogs in our children's schools, national databases that track our finances and activities, sneak-and-peek searches of our homes without our knowledge or consent, and anti-terrorism laws that turn average Americans into suspects. In short, America has become a lockdown nation, and we are all in danger. Sadly, the police state has gone global and there is no place to go to escape it. In the second hour, we discuss the role of media and education in teaching compliance to government violence. We'll also discuss John Carpenter's prophetic visions of the American police state and talk about other fiction writers and visionaries who predicted this would happen. Today the U.S. government and Supreme Court blatantly violate the U.S. Constitution and America has transitioned from a society governed by "we the people" to a police state governed by a strong arm of law and corruption and it will only get worse if "the people" remain compliant.

Gavan is currently involved in a musical project with long term musical/life partner Moonswift. We'll discuss the marketing of corrosive counter-culture modern art and the attack on beauty. Gavan discusses the cult of personality around empty artists that have put focus on rot and death. Art is degenerating into nothing but sensationalism. The success of modern art is judged by how much attention it can get and consequently the more subversive, disgusting and pornographic it is, the more the attention it gets by the "critics" and media pundits. Shock factor is mistaken for greatness. Gavan asks what happened to art that conveys beauty, holds veneration for life and is inspirational. Kearney says that the Frankfurt School has been instrumental in turning art into crude smut and emptiness. In the second hour, we discuss the origin of modern art and the movement of symbolic art. We discuss the conspiratorial aspect of art, including how the totalitarian state has used it for propaganda. Also we talk about modern furniture, architecture, new art installations and bizarre statues and monuments. Later, we discuss violence and sexual perversion in TV and movies. We also go into how the "new hero" we are to identify with is the evil villain.

Joseph and Scott explain the primordial drive behind technology. Also, Scott ties in various works of fiction that reveal messages of alchemical transformation. Then, we'll discuss the creation of a new unified man through technology. In the transhumanist's world there will be no place for the individual and humanity is taken out of the equation. In the second hour, we'll talk about the 4 steps in the declension of mankind beginning with androgyny and the technological fusion with humanity at each of the 4 levels. We'll also discuss modern technology that is presenting questions of ownership and what nightmare scenarios may arise because of it. At what point are we no longer human but owned by a corporation or the state? Later, we question if artificial intelligence already have taken over. Yet in the end, a system that is unhuman, therefore means that no human can live in it.

Description: Jon Rappoport is an investigative journalist, author and publisher of the web site nomorefakenews.com. He returns to discuss the ongoing conspiracy to collectivize humanity. Collectivism isn't about a mass outpouring of share and care and is not what will bring freedom. We'll discuss collectivism as a psyop and the usual prose formulated around this grand psyop. Jon explains the historical roots of collectivism that has tentacles in government, education and social sciences. Then, we talk about how the Individual is fading out as a concept. Individualism is becoming a myth, which plays in perfectly to facilitate the agenda of the "planned state." We talk about why the state hates the individual. Jon also elaborates on how collectivist reality is being manufactured and accepted. He says, "This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with a heavily armed, surveilled Disneyland. Everyone takes the same rides and eats the same cotton candy. In this cartoon called reality, whoever declines and defects is reeducated." Later, we discuss the collectivists' faith in state and the prospect of a socialist, egalitarian utopia with all its contradictions. Meanwhile, the notion of individual freedom and a free society is being associated with fear and evil deeds. The massive media control, brain washing and propaganda is indicative of just how afraid the controlling factions are of the individual. The hour ends speaking on freedom, which has no limit.

Description: Richard C. Hoagland is a former NASA Consultant and former Science Advisor to Walter Cronkite and CBS News during the epic Apollo Missions to the Moon. He is author of two bestselling books on his 40 years of intensive research into the possibility of a former, ancient solar-system-wide high-tech civilization. He returns to discuss the fascinating symbols, rituals and mysteries surrounding Comet ISON. ISON has been billed as a potential "comet of the century," with some experts saying it could blaze as brightly as the full moon around the time of its close solar approach in late November. Richard says Comet Elenin was a forerunner of the big thing, Comet ISON. He'll address the intentional creation of "fear porn" about coming celestial bodies, which is ultimately coming from a secret religion grounded in the knowledge of how to change reality. In the member's hour, Hoagland continues on numbers and sacred mythology attached to important celestial bodies. Richard lays out how ISON is a pivotal part of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi Russia to fulfill a bigger ritual. He'll talk about how Comet ISON is a wonderful happening that can change the world for the positive. Later, we'll hear about other key dates and cultural connections connected to ISON's path.

In the last three years, Grave Distractions has published over fifty books for nineteen different authors. He joins us to discuss his new book Steinbeck: Citizen Spy. Brian obtained two documents from the CIA via the Freedom of Information Act that blows away everything we thought about Steinbeck. The first piece is a letter, in Steinbeck's own handwriting, offering to work for the agency. The second is a reply from Walter Bedell Smith accepting Steinbeck's offer. In his investigations he's also uncovered that the FBI has destroyed portions of Steinbeck's FBI file. Utilizing information from Steinbeck's FBI file, John's own correspondence, and interviews with John's son Thomas Steinbeck, playwright Edward Albee, a former CIA intelligence officer, and others, Steinbeck: Citizen Spy uncovers the secret life of American cultural icon and Nobel Prize--winner, John Steinbeck. Did Steinbeck actively gather information for the intelligence community during his 1947 and 1963 trips to the Soviet Union? Why was the controversial author of The Grapes of Wrath never called before the House Select Committee on Un-American Activities, despite alleged ties to Communist organizations? Did the CIA influence Steinbeck to produce Cold War propaganda as part of Operation MOCKINGBIRD? Why did the CIA admit to the Church Committee in 1975 that Steinbeck was a subject of their illegal mail-opening program known as HTLINGUAL? We'll discuss all this and more.

Title: Red Ice Radio - James Swagger - Hour 1 - The Newgrange Sirius Mystery
Date: 2013-11-08

Description: James Swagger was first introduced to topical science writing for a historical mysteries magazine in Ireland. He was trained as a Systems Analyst in the energy industry. He holds a Master degree in Engineering, Bachelors in Physics with Astronomy, and a Masters in Science, Research and Society. Initially, Swagger sought out the megalithic monuments of Western Europe in his spare time travelling around the UK, Ireland, and Denmark. His embrace of a multidisciplinary approach to the research of megalithic sites, and the larger view of 'passage grave cosmology' produced his first book, "The Newgrange Sirius Mystery: Linking Passage Grave Cosmology with Dogon Symbology." James joins us from Ireland, to discuss his books and his research. In the first hour, we outline the megaliths in the Boyne valley. We'll discuss the passage grave cosmology, archeoastronomy and archaeoacoustics. We focus on the relationship between the stars, the art and entoptic imagery. In the second hour, we'll speak more about megalithic acoustics. James profiles the builder, including who they were and what their purpose was. Then, we discuss Porcupine Bank, the sunken piece of land to the west of Ireland. There is a possibility that this was Hy-Brasil, the mythical island. Was this the origin of the builders of these monuments and ritual temples? Later, we discuss world-wide catastrophe which might have spawned the building of the megaliths as calendars and navigational star instruments.

Title: Radio 3Fourteen - Peter Eric Hendrickson - Cracking the Code: The Truth About Taxation in America
Date: 2013-11-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=FM2MfqLc1MY
Description: Researcher, analyst and scholar Peter E. Hendrickson discusses his liberating book Cracking the Code. For the 64 years of its existence, the U. S. Internal Revenue Code has been ridiculed, feared and despised by virtually everyone. As presented by the IRS, the code purposefully appears illogical, inconsistent and incomprehensible. The vast majority of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is not the law itself, but is only evidence-- a representation-- of the actual statutes in force, and like in the game of post-office, the real language has been a bit garbled in transmission. Peter breaks apart the beast and makes it simple to understand but what you will learn contradicts everything you've been told! We'll discuss the origin of the income tax, constitutional limitations, IRS misinformation and making educated filings to set the record straight with the IRS. He explains how definitions such as "income," "wages," "self-employment income," "employee," "employer" and "trade or business"-- in regard to, the tax law-- have narrow legal meanings exclusively involving, and applying to, certain privileged activities, such as holding or administering a government office, or working in one. This excludes the vast majority of people who are paying income taxes. We discuss elements of this corrupt scheme and who is profiting. Uninformed citizens are inadvertently participating in the transformation of their untaxable earnings into taxable income, surrendering their wealth to crooks never to be seen again. If you want to stand up in accordance with the truth and liberate yourself spiritually and financially and if you want to stop funding your own destruction, listen to this program.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Klaus Bernpaintner - Hour 1 - A Swedish Lesson in Conformity & Control
Date: 2013-11-08

Description: Klaus Bernpaintner is a Senior Fellow of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, Sweden, an entrepreneur and a former financial analyst. He earned an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, USA, and an MSc from the Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. He joins us to discuss modern problems created by government. He shares how true economics is the strongest proof against government. We'll focus on Swedish politics, economics and collectivist "solutions" as the Nordic model is being praised and promoted to the United States. Klaus dismantles the common misbelief that Swedish citizens get "free stuff." Since Sweden has the most centralized government in the world with the 2nd highest tax rate burden in the world, we investigate into the supposed claim that Sweden is the "happiest country in the world" and look into the results of socialist ideology. We also discuss fake privatization of businesses and how government regulation creates corruption, yet the people wrongfully blame free market capitalism. In the second hour, we discuss what creates the narrow bandwidth of perspective in a society like Sweden. We discuss how centralized government operates to shape and control behavior of the masses. Klaus explains how "family policy" is being used to control the choices families make. In a collectivist society, the inhabitants cannot see the value of taking charge of one's own destiny. Klaus returns to economic fascism to expose how government creates disastrous effects. He explains why entrepreneurs are leaving Sweden. Later, we critique not only Sweden's healthcare system but Obamacare. We can predict just how this will end. Although global politics seems to be closing in around us and although we may be in for a bumpy ride, Klaus leaves a positive message about the long term.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Steven & Evan Strong - Hour 1 - Aboriginal Origins & Egyptian Glyphs in Australia
Date: 2013-11-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oa4yq0UooJs
Description: Steven and Evan Strong join us from New South Wales, Australia to discuss their claim that Aboriginal people set sail from Australia, 50,000 years ago. They sailed to and settled in America and visited many other places including Egypt, Japan, Africa and India. Their theory states that Aboriginals, the first Homo sapiens who evolved before the sapiens of Africa, gave the world art, axes, religion, marine technology, culture, language and surgery. Weaved into this story is that of the Kariong Glyphs, a group of approximately 300 alleged Egyptian hieroglyphs in and around an area that is also known for its Aboriginal petroglyphs. Steven and Evan have developed much of their work from consultations with Aboriginal people in Australia. They claim they have rediscovered a hidden history of our origin as humans and have written several books on the subject including Forgotten Origin, Constructing a New World Map, Ancient Alien in Australia and the latest one, Shunned. In the second hour, we elaborate on the myths connected to this origin story. We'll discuss recent archeological finds and what approach they have to these discoveries. There are some startling and extraordinary claims. We'll ask about who is overseeing this work and what is next in order to secure these sites. How will these results impact our understanding of human origins?

Description: Darrell Becker runs the blog Voluntary Visions which puts focus on the intellectual lenses of the Trivium method of critical thinking, Voluntary Communication, the Non-Aggression Principle, as well as other lenses, so as to create internal and interpersonal emotional and intellectual equilibrium. He'll discuss the skills of the Trivium Method of critical thinking in conjunction with the skills of using Voluntary Communication (NVC), in order to produce greater inner and interpersonal, intellectual and empathetic equilibrium. Darrell has written an essay on the topic, which we'll go over including, the the "4D's" of disconnected communication, using logic and grammar scans, removing personal cognitive dissonance, building bridges of empathy and understanding "emotional and mental splinters." Hasty generalizations, psychological intrusion, demands and deserve oriented language are examples of diagnoses that are unrequested and will not help you build bridges with others. But we also connect this practice and apply it to understand the best pathway to take when communicating with "authority," or the ill-mannered. Later, we'll discuss questions one can ask and answer in order to properly care for their intellectual and emotional lenses. The hour ends on how to view problems or obstacles when looking through a healthy lens.

Description: Josh del Sol is the producer/director of the film Take Back Your Power. Around the world, corporate utilities and governments are racing to replace electricity, gas and water meters with new-generation 'smart' meters with surveillance capabilities, quietly using billions in taxpayer funds. But at what cost to human rights, finances, security and health? With compelling insight from insiders, government representatives, whistle-blowers, lawyers, doctors and environmentalists, Take Back Your Power investigates claimed benefits and emerging risks of this ubiquitous 'smart' grid program. Transparency advocate Josh del Sol takes us on a journey of revelation and discovery while asking: Are 'smart' grid technologies effective, safe and eco-friendly? Are corporations violating foundational rights and privacy - without providing benefit - in the name of 'green'? What are the end goals of the smart grid? What truly sustainable solutions are now unfolding that can meet the great challenges faced by our civilization? Josh del Sol will talk about the dark agenda, hiding under the guise of energy, unless we prevent it. What can someone do, who either does not want to have a smart meter, or who already has one and wants it removed? We'll discuss all of this and more.

He is the author of Government: Indicted and Adventures in Legal Land, a lawyer-upsetting people-helping book. He'll discuss how there is no rational basis for government. Marc explains how believing in government is the worship of psychopaths. We discuss how although government is a lying, killing, vile institution that defies the non aggression principle, people still fail to apply critical thinking skills and see government for what it is. Marc speaks about engaging with government agents and the lies they tell. Later in the first hour, we talk about the Constitution of the U.S. which many put their trust in. In the member's hour, Marc explains our "battered citizen syndrome" relationship with government and how they have infested every aspect of our lives. He'll give his position on what is required to neutralize the attack and rid the parasitic forces at play. Then, we'll get into government mandated licenses, permits and fees. Marc speaks about rejecting government programming, as the programming makes it possible for a few to control the world. We'll also talk about how the mentality of the people would change after government collapsed. Later, we address the human idea of rights. Can you prove you have rights? The hour ends discussing circular arguments he's encountered in court dealing with government agents and their lack of evidence proving their position. "The code applies because the code says so."

Title: Red Ice Radio - Tjeerd Andringa - Hour 1 - Bureaucracy, Geopolitics: Authoritarians vs. Libertarians
Date: 2013-11-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZhNbDmMOfzw
Description: Tjeerd Andringa is an associate professor of Sensory Cognition at the ALICE Institute at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. He recently wrote a fascinating paper that provides an in-depth analysis of bureaucracy as a psychological phenomenon. The paper also lists key-features and indicators of encroaching government administration that creates virtual iron cages with papers, rules, forms and protocols. Andringa details the driving forces of bureaucracy from the perspective of cognitive science. He explains that the authoritarian's fear of a complex world is existential, so the technocrat in charge of government or other organizations is quite ruthless in the efforts to simplify the working environment(the real world), in order to try to understand it better. He says that fear is at the root of the problem. In the second hour, we discuss further how bureaucracy applies to both conspiracies and geopolitics. We discuss how behavior drives decisions that can be categorized either as authoritarian or libertarian. A clear distinction is made between authoritarians, who favor more bureaucracy vs. libertarians, who favor no bureaucracy at all. Later, Tjeerd says that bureaucracies always arise under authoritarian control. Authoritarians crave a clear chain of command. He explains that the system becomes dysfunctional when you have intelligence without understanding.

Also joining in is Andras Jones an actor, musician and the author of Accidental Initiations: In The Kabbalistic Tree of Olympia. He is best known for his role in Nightmare on Elm Street 4. We'll discuss possible sub-textual messages in The Shining. What was Stanley Kubrick really telling us? What was he really involved in? We talk about how Kubrick played on the ignorance of the viewer, leaving visual information, clues in the corner but people often missed them. Are the synchronicities, symbols and messages found in Kubrick's film intentional or was a higher force working through him? Then, we'll discuss the work of Will Morgan who compiled footage pointing out the synchronicities in the movies Andras Jones appeared in. Andras elaborates on how these syncs paralleled with his life off camera, just as others have pointed out this same phenomena with many other actors. We end on the big question of where human kind is heading just as Kubrick speculated on man's future in his film 2001: A Space Odyssey.

He is the author of several books and numerous articles on complexity theory, social technologies, new media communications, and conscious evolution. We'll discuss his book The Struggle for Your Mind: Conscious Evolution & The Battle to Control How We Think. Kinglsey explains how within society there exists a silent war. The battlefield is our everyday lives: our education, our work, our leisure, our emotional and spiritual well-being, and our thinking and perceptions. Our very sense of "reality" is deliberately engineered to work against conscious evolution and preserve social norms. In short, we are all part of a war of consciousness. He discusses how the opportunity is at hand for us to win. We'll explore the biology of consciousness and the tactics being used to control it. He continues more in the second hour, explaining how we can free up mental and emotional energy to break through the barriers inhibiting conscious evolution and that by taking back our minds and changing the way we think, we can restore our connection with Nature and the Divine.

In the first hour, Neil explains his philosophy of authentic living and examining what's important. We'll discuss the importance of being self directed in a polarized "machine culture," forcing us to choose between the mind or the heart. He elaborates on divine will and explains why society denies it. Those not exercising divine will become spellbound, subservient subjects. We also discuss the importance of the introspective, introverted lifestyle. In the member's hour, we discuss further what happens to a society when divine will is suppressed. Neil speaks more on the contemplative, introverted lifestyle and living between the external and internal worlds. The hour ends on connecting to our core essence and bringing about divine will.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Anthony Peake - Hour 1 - The Infinite Mindfield: The Mystery of Consciousness
Date: 2013-11-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=L8xhdMuGtyU
Description: Anthony Peake grew up near Liverpool, England. He studied sociology and history at the University of Warwick before attending the London School of Economics. Prior to becoming a full-time science writer, he was a management consultant in the human resources industry. He is the author of several books and probably best known for his fascinating theory, which he terms Cheating the Ferryman. It suggests a new approach to the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the external world. His previous titles include The Daemon, The Labyrinth of Time, Is There Life after Death? and Out of Body Experiences. In this program, we discuss his latest book, The Infinite Mindfield. Peake delves into what many scientists believe to be the thorniest problem, namely how does the material substance of the brain give rise to the ethereal self-awareness we all experience? Peake says that when you look at things like the science of quantum mechanics or the astonishing properties of DNA, you can't help but realize that everything is driven by consciousness. He says that our understanding of our own mind is very limited, yet we have materialistic scientists drawing conclusions based on this limited understanding. In the second hour, we go deeper into some of the fundamental philosophical questions. We discuss epistemology, promissory materialism and the practice of self-observance as a means to perfect our own awareness.

Title: Radio 3Fourteen - William Patrick Patterson - G.I. Gurdjieff: The Fourth Way
Date: 2013-11-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=nJCtXmMQW-8
Description: William Patrick Patterson is a teacher of The Fourth Way, an ancient, esoteric teaching of self-development brought to the West by G. I. Gurdjieff, which predates not only Christianity but the Egyptian, Judaic, Persian, Buddhist and Islamic religions. He is the author of 8 books on The Fourth Way and is the director-writer-narrator of the documentary DVD trilogy The Life & Significance of G.I. Gurdjieff. Patterson was a longtime student of Lord John Pentland, who was appointed by Gurdjieff to be the leader of the Work in America and William is the founder/director of The Gurdjieff Studies Program. For many years he has led groups, as well as given seminars and talks throughout the United States. We'll discuss the esoteric teaching of The Fourth Way, including the concept that humans are not born with a soul but must create and develop a soul through the course of life. William elaborates on Gurdjieff's claim that people cannot perceive reality in their current states because they do not possess consciousness but rather live in a state of a hypnotic waking sleep. "Man lives his life in sleep, and in sleep he dies." As a result of this condition, each person perceives things from a completely subjective perspective. People in their typical state function as unconscious automatons, but that one can wake up and become a different sort of human being altogether. We'll also discuss the many I's, from selves to individual to the self. Later, William explains how humanity is in danger of losing our freedom to machines as we are giving more power to our mechanical side. William presents a different perspective on life, one that defies most teachings you've heard.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=wHkonQS82r8
Description: Thomas Sheridan is an artist, writer and musician from Ireland. He is the author of Puzzling People: The Labyrinth of the Psychopath and The Anvil of the Psyche. We'll discuss Russell Brand's interview on British Brain Control (BBC) where he advocated a SOCIALIST EGALITARIAN system based on the massive redistribution of wealth to solve today's political problems. We'll talk about why a socialist egalitarian system will most definitely not solve problems or free the people. Thomas explains how Russell Brand, the arm chair socialist, is not waking people up. Brand is put on the TV screens to placate the ones already 'awake', and to put you back to sleep in the belief that this is some kind of victory. It's isn't - it is showbiz being used as a social engineering tool yet again. We'll talk about Brand's connections, including The New Statesman, started by the Fabian Society, the London School of Economics, symbolism around him and his ideas of a new age collective utopia. We address the true problem and talk about the real solution. In the second hour, Sheridan explains his analogy of the socially acceptable "Brand new purple pill," the third option now available. He speaks about how various movements have been taken, co-opted and watered down to dampen the truth. Then, we get into the idea of forced wealth redistribution vs. voluntary giving in a truly free society and other crimes against nature in a socialist egalitarian system. Later, we speak about the oxytocin effects of celebrity and powerful elite that can create hysteria.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=63JrAzubX-8
Description: David Livingstone has been researching the hidden aspects of history for the last 25 years, resulting in three books. David's approach to history is to dare to consider those areas often dismissed by scholars as the subject of cranks, but to investigate these matters with the utmost scholarly rigor. The results are works that expose many neglected areas of history. David returns to discuss themes from his latest book, Black Terror White Soldiers: Islam, Fascism & the New Age. David will discuss how the Muslim brotherhood is a tool used for American policy, ultimately helping to bring in a new world order. In the first hour, David talks about the disconnections in the Islamic world as the true religion is misinterpreted and buried intentionally. Then we'll discuss Muslim brotherhood propaganda with ties that lead to the Rockefellers. We also discuss the connections of the Protocols of Zion to the Memphis-Mizraim rite of Freemasonry and the creation of Sabbatai Zevi's messiahship by the Rosicrucians. David explains how Rosicrucian legend is at the core of the Kabbalah, freemasonry and the occult revival while the roots of Rosicrucian legend originated from Shambhala and Asian shamanism. In the second hour, David speaks about the basis of the Islamic way. We'll talk about multiculturalism and anti-European sentiment. Next, he discusses Synarchism, origins of fascism and the ultimate goal of the elite to fulfill Biblical prophecy. Later, we hear his opinion about the fabrication of the UFO mythos by occultists.

Title: Russell Brand's Fantasy of a Socialist Egalitarian Utopia - Red Ice Commentary
Date: 2013-10-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=COMj3Nw2c3M
Description: In a recent diatribe on BBC, Hollywood actor Russell Brand with Jeremy Paxman spoke candidly about his desire to create a "Socialist egalitarian system based on the massive redistribution of wealth and heavy taxation of corporations." In this commentary we question Brand's so called "good intentions" and how qualified he really is to talk about these topics as a multi-millionaire. More importantly, we discuss his connection to the Fabian Socialist magazine the "New Statesman," of which he was co-editing for a week before his senseless speech and call for a revolution on TV.

Description: William Engdahl is an award-winning geopolitical analyst, strategic risk consultant, author, professor and lecturer. He has been researching and writing about the world political scene for more than thirty years. His various books on geopolitics have been translated into 14 foreign languages. After earning a degree in politics from Princeton University, and graduate study in comparative economics at Stockholm University, he worked as an economist and investigative freelance journalist in New York and Europe. In this program, we discuss William's book Seeds of Destruction in which he outlines the dark agenda to take control of the global food supply. He'll talk about who the players are and how they have created the green movement to get the job done. Before Monsanto and Syngenta were formed, the Rockefeller Foundation together with The Ford Foundation and DuPont/Pioneer were instrumental in turning agriculture into agribusiness. The latest move in their plan has been to set up the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard, also known as the Doomsday Vault. Engdahl explains how philanthropists like Bill & Melinda Gates and Warren Buffet have been involved in donating large amounts of money to this project. Do they know something we don't? Finally William connects the dots between depopulation, eugenics and the conspiracy to control the world's food production.

What can we learn from the past and what is our place in the universe? In the second hour, we go deeper to discuss the future direction of humanity and the current modern view of being separate from the natural world. Can a modern society, highly dependent on technology, integrate into the natural world? We'll discuss the modern notion of "progress" and how future technology may end humanity as we know it. Schoch reminds us that in the past, big extinctions have followed after a civilization has reached the peak of their evolution. We end on the idea of outside assistance both in the past and in the present.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Joseph Atwill & Ryan Gilmore - Hour 1 - Religious Mind Control & Modern Conflicts
Date: 2013-09-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=oL9S10Dazmg
Description: Joseph Atwill is an independent scholar who has set the world of New Testament scholarship in a new direction. In his book "Caesar's Messiah - The Roman Conspiracy to Invent Jesus," Atwill outlines the series of events in Jesus' ministry that are parallels with the events of the battle campaign of Titus Flavius as recorded by Josephus Flavius in "War of the Jews." Numerous scholars had noticed the parallels between the Gospels and Josephus' work before, but Atwill is the first to notice that all the parallels take place in exact sequence and draw a revolutionary conclusion. Also joining in is Ryan Gilmore who is behind the upcoming event Covert Messiah - Is Christianity the Genesis of Modern Psychological Warfare? We'll discuss how Christianity, the mind control program of the Imperial Cult, has shaped our world to what it is today. The ancient war between Rome and Judea still rages today. Most people do not understand who the players are or that they are targets in this age old story of revenge. In our second hour, we continue to outline the history of the conflict and the nature of the war. We speak about mind control, the sexual revolution and MK Ultra. Joseph and Ryan describe how pacification through religion has led to neo-feudalism. The play pen which we've been given has shaped our minds, our thought process and our concept of history. We end on comparing Shakespeare's work to the Bible. Joseph contends that Shakespeare's work is a "reply" to the bible as they contain the same typology.

In her former life, she was a middle/high school teacher. Suzanne is the author of three books-How to Choose a Husband and Make Peace With Marriage (February 2013), The Flipside of Feminism (2011), and 7 Myths of Working Mothers (2004)- and one Kindle single: The War on Men (February 2013). She is also on the board of directors at The Center for Marriage Policy. She is a regular guest on The John Gibson Radio Show and a frequent contributor to Fox News. Her work has been published in the New York Post, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Parents.com, Human Events, and many others. She has appeared on The View, Fox & Friends, Fox's former Dayside with Linda Vester, ABCNews.com, CNN with Carol Lin, C-Span, and Canadian and Australian news outlets—as well as hundreds of radio shows throughout the country. In this interview, we'll discuss The War on Men. Suzanne talks about how over the last four decades, America has witnessed a profound change in marriage and gender relations. As a result, women pursue independence in a way that was previ¬ously unimaginable. In addition, technological advances and an economic boom have changed the way people live, work, and communicate. Suzanne explains how modern feminism, with its relentless talk of hapless housewives, female empowerment, and gender role reversal, has severed the bond between the sexes, pitting men and women against one another. She addresses the myth of gender equality. We'll talk about how men today have no respect for women and vice versa. Marriage has turned into a competition rather than a partnership and dating is defunct. She points out how young children and demanding careers are incompatible as women today outsource the care of their children. Today's modern woman wraps her identity up in her job rather than her family. She discusses how insulting it is to suggest that all women lived miserable lives previous to the feminist movement. Yet today the majority of women still choose family and marriage over work. Later, she talks about a mind shift to end the war on men.

Description: Co-authors Dr. Brian Clement and Dr. Anna Maria Clement are Co-Directors of the Hippocrates Health Institute in West Palm Beach, Florida. These two physicians created wellness and disease prevention programs followed by more than 300,000 people who have spent a week or more at the Institute. They have authored a dozen books on natural health antidotes to illness and disease. We discuss their book Killer Clothes. They'll explain how seemingly innocent clothing choices endanger your health. This has been documented by numerous medical studies. Brian and Anna Maria detail the toxins involved in clothing and fabric manufacturing. We talk about the harmful effects of synthetic clothing vs. the advantages of natural fiber fabrics and organics. Drs. Brian and Anna Maria explain how the increased use of synthetic clothing fibers has contributed to breast cancer, infertility and a range of diseases. Women who wear synthetic bras, nylons and panties are at a greater risk of getting cancer and infections. We'll also discuss the "father" of synthetic fabrics, Wallace Hume Carothers, a Dupont chemist who later killed himself. While the fashion industry attempts to uphold an image of beauty, hosting charitable galas claiming to care about humanity and the environment, lays an ugly secret hidden from public awareness involving lobbyists, mass worldwide pollution, money and cancer causing chemicals. Meanwhile natural super fibers such a hemp, that grow naturally without any intervention, are suppressed. Later, we discuss the hypocrisy of the eco-friendly and green claims used by health companies and organic clothing manufacturers. The interview ends on the dangerous future of clothing as nanoparticles are now being woven into fabrics.

He explains that continuing the Greek tragedy is not what is going to restore the nation's economy, neither is more government spending. Exiting out of the "debt clutches" of the EU will be done through internally producing and manufacturing what the country needs. In the second hour, we'll discuss loans, interest, politicians, direct democracy and the current media environment around the world. Although a major global economic crash seems to be inevitable, there are many encouraging and positive developments. Bill speaks about some of the signs that are indicating that the tide is turning.

Description: Australian Warren McLachlan tells the tragic story of battling the Finnish government for his children. It all began when his Finnish wife surrendered their two children to Finnish social services while they were separated. Warren explains the details of this horrifically unjust case, ongoing for over 10 years, in the attempts to get his children back. He'll talk about how his children are under the care of unreasonable psychiatrists who have heavily medicated his children. Warren talks about how the Finnish Justice Department refuses to enforce the law against the offending psychiatrists and how Finnish human rights groups lack sufficient resources to help. We'll discuss the Finnish government child care system that provides the ideal environment for child abusers and medical testing. Although Warren is the capable willing father of these children and his ex-wife is unsound, the state is blocking him from gaining custody while his children move around from various government homes and institutions. We'll also discuss how governments and medical companies are profiting from social services. And all the while Finnish media will not give this case attention.

Title: Radio 3Fourteen - Paul Elam - A Voice for Men: Feminist Misandry
Date: 2013-08-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=9TYq6RlWdBc
Description: Paul Elam, founder of avoiceformen.com discusses the biggest issues men currently face, namely feminist ideologies and the psychological war against men. Paul explains how he woke up to anti male sentiments in politics. He points out areas where men are victims of discrimination and in which female abuse of men is facilitated by law. We converse on egalitarianism and the notion that government should resolve our conflicts. We'll also discuss the early days of feminism and what they were after verses the feminists of today. He talks about feminist ideological agendas that are contradictory. In early human survival it was considered that men were disposable and women were a rare resource, due to their reproductive ability. This old view of gender roles is still in play today and men are considered disposable. We address male (and female) violence, rape accusations, and the idea that the patriarchy has been responsible for all evils against women. We discuss more areas where men are demonized by feminist propaganda, including within academia, which is at the root of the problem. We'll continue on violent feminist groups and how consumer society is catering to please women. Later, we'll discuss healthy relationships, the family unit and individual responsibility. What is real and what is an artificial construct in our male/female relationships? Paul explains how the lack of male role models in young children's lives is leading to an extraordinary level of psychological problems. Also, we address circumcision, the mutilation of male genitalia. We end the hour on violent patriarchal Gods.

The promoted excuse is to "cure" posttraumatic stress and simply erase memories that are considered to be too painful for soldiers. We discuss the disconnection that people have to their emotions, experiences and memories. This has now developed into a psychological disease. We discuss the deeper issues that is behind character development and how so called "negative" experiences make you who you are and can be tremendously important to build self-esteem and to give you a sense of achievement when you overcome the setbacks and challenges you face.

His books have sold more than five million copies worldwide and have been translated into 27 languages. Graham has become recognized as an unconventional thinker who raises controversial questions about humanity's past and where we are heading. In this program we discuss Graham's latest historical novel "War God" about the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. He explains that this was a war of both gods and men. Dark powers worked behind the scenes of history as the prophecy of the return of Quetzalcoatl finally was fulfilled with the arrival of Cortes in the new world. The Aztec ruler Moctezuma fought to maintain the demands of the war god Huitzilopochtli (hummingbird) for human sacrifice. Graham says that same manipulative demon might have been behind the communication that Cortes and Moctezuma's had with their "god." In the second hour we talk about angels, demons and Graham's own experiences with hallucinogenic plants. There are dark forces in the spirit realm waiting to take advantage of humans not equipped for these sorts of quests. Later he talks about the war on consciousness and explains that only free individuals, living on a voluntary basis, that have the freedom to explore their own consciousness, is the only way out of our current predicament.

In this program we'll discuss government violence, human violence and what "the rule of the jungle" really means. Larken explains that the most violent and immoral people ascend to politics and to positions of power. Also, we talk about the movie "The Purge," a propaganda hit piece on anarchism and about the unrealistic fantasy of what would happen in society, if for one day, there were no laws. In our second hour, we explore concepts of justice and equality. One of the most powerful weapons that governments have at their disposal is people's misdirected good intentions and a morally convinced population. Rose explains how belief in government equals religious programming; it's deification of a system that really doesn't exist anywhere, except in the minds of people. We are the ones making it real and giving this invisible entity its power. We'll also discuss how Larken could be deemed a terrorist at any time. The term has changed meaning and morphed into incorporating new groups and ideologies. Later, we talk about a very positive development of how an increasing amount of people have started to understand the pro voluntary and anarchist perspective. The "spark" that is inherent in people, who question government and its role, is spreading like wildfire, Larken says.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Penney Peirce - Hour 1 - Leap of Perception
Date: 2013-07-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=j_gQwTsB7kI
Description: Penney Peirce is one of the early pioneers in the intuition development movement, having worked since 1977 with organizations like the San Francisco-based Center for Applied Intuition, The Institute for the Study of Conscious Evolution, and The Intuition Network. An author, lecturer, counselor, and trainer, Penney specializes in intuition and "skillful perception," personal energy and frequency training, dreamwork, and future trends. Penney is the author of 6 books. She returns to discuss her latest work, Leap of Perception: The Transforming Power of Your Attention. Penney explains how the Information Age is speeding to a point where life will soon make a leap into the Intuition Age. The resulting reality will function according to different rules and we'll know ourselves as a new kind of human being. She discusses the way in which we feed the current system based on old perception, instead of withdrawing our energy from it in order to bring about the new. In the second hour, Penney discusses ways of using our attention that will become normal in the Intuition Age. We'll also hear about spherical-holographic reality, duality and violence in the intuition age, oscillating consciousness and interpreting dreams.

We'll begin the program by asking a question and getting an answer by randomly selecting a song and interpreting it as the answer, like playing musical tarot cards. Then, we'll discuss themes from Andras' book, Accidental Initiations such as the synchronistic pursuit, cinema as a psychedelic medium and memory as a kind of time travel. Andras will talk about the The Kabbalistic Tree of Olympia and the ritual drama of unconsciously "walking the tree of life." We discuss how the tree of life forms a sacred geometric grid on the body consisting of a series of power points also called chakras or Sephiroth. Jones explains how "a balanced diet of cults" plays into the needs of fulfilling the chakra system. We end the hour on the Jewish opinion that says 40 is the ideal age to begin to study the Kabbalah.

Since 2002 Pier Paolo Alberghini has been working with a new approach to achieve well-being for the users of the buildings he designs, by applying the science of BioGeometry. Alberghini and Karim have collaborated successfully in BioGeometry projects in Europe and North America. We'll discuss how BioGeometry bridges science and spirituality to produce a natural harmony into the environment. In the first hour, Ibrahim and Pier Paolo explain how BioGeometrical shapes interact with Earth's energy to produce a balancing effect on all energy levels of biological systems. Karim talks about his research into shapes of body organs which led to the discovery of the relationship between organ function, energy pattern, and shape. These patterns called "BioSignatures" produce, through resonance, a balance of energy and immunity that support orthodox and alternative medicine. We'll discuss how BioGeometry provides a viable solution in transforming the quality of the effect that electromagnetic radiation has on living systems. In the second hour, we'll discuss the Physics of Quality in more detail. We'll also hear about the relationship between electromagnetic fields and morals. Karim and Alberghini discuss their solutions to rebalance with nature.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Robert G. Johnson & Janey Westin - Hour 1 - The Last Kings of Norse America
Date: 2013-07-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=jvVU0iopIlM
Description: Robert G. Johnson received his Ph.D. in physics from Iowa State University. After a puzzle-solving career in industrial research at Honeywell, he joined the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Minnesota to work on the mystery of past climate variations. Johnson has published many research papers and one book: Secrets of the Ice Ages: the Role of the Mediterranean Sea in Climate Change. Initially a professional calligrapher, Janey Westin pursued paleographic studies of medieval manuscripts, stone inscriptions, the structure of letterforms, and the tools and materials of the trade. This work expanded into stone letter carving and sculpting. Her studio, Paper & Stone, is located in Edina, Minnesota. Robert and his daughter Janey discuss their book, The Last Kings of Norse America: Runestone Keys to a Lost Empire. They connect the runestones to a Norse expedition to North America, documented by a 1354 Royal Proclamation. Johnson explains that both the Kensington stone, found in 1898 on a settler's farm near Kensington, Minn., and Spirit Pond runestone, found 73 years later on coastal Maine, were memorials to the men lost during an expedition to North America. The authors say the trip was led by Haakon VI, son of Magnus, King of Sweden and Norway, and the Honorable Paul Knutson, a king's law speaker in Norway, who was in command. Westin explains that the key to accurately translate the runic inscriptions is in recognizing that many of the words were abbreviated in medieval style. Her translations of both stones are published in the book. The authors weave historical research and controversial Norse findings in North America with an in-depth linguistic study to present an adventure of travel and tragedy.

Description: Daniel Estulin is an investigative journalist who has been researching the Bilderbergers for over 14 years. He is the author of "The True Story of the Bilderberg Group" and "The Octopus Deception." He also hosts a show on RT. Daniel joins us for a quick update on the ongoing Bilderberg 2013 meeting in Watford, England. Daniel explains that because of increased media attention from both mainstream and alternative media, it has become quite irrelevant as a "secret" meeting. He talks about how it's now turned into a circus, comparing it to something like the Woodstock music festival. "The Bilderberg meeting is important to a point, but it's not the top of the pyramid," he says. Bilderberg is just a small part of a bigger agenda and together with other organizations and meetings it represents an ideology of world control. "The great unwashed" are the enemies of the elite and they do not meet to try to solve many of the world's problems, as naive people think. When it comes to issues like avoiding another financial bubble, it's actually about how to destroy the world economy in an orderly fashion. Some of the other topics discussed during the meetings are how to control the world's food supply and technology. Later, Daniel shares with us some of the latest information discussed during Bilderberg about how the elite are planning to deal with Iran's nuclear program, their presidential election and sanctions against the country.

Title: Was Michael Hastings Murdered?
Date: 2013-06-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=hFx4EqJ9glE
Description: What happend to Michael Hastings? The revelation that Rolling Stone journalist Michael Hastings was working on a story about the CIA before his death and had contacted a Wikileaks lawyer about being under investigation by the FBI hours before his car exploded into flames has bolstered increasingly valid claims that the 33-year-old was assassinated.

Hastings died last week in Hollywood when his car hit a tree at high speed.

According to a prominent security analyst, technology exists that could've allowed someone to hack his car. Former U.S. National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism Richard Clarke told The Huffington Post that what is known about the single-vehicle crash is "consistent with a car cyber attack."

Clarke said, "There is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers" — including the United States — know how to remotely seize control of a car.

"What has been revealed as a result of some research at universities is that it's relatively easy to hack your way into the control system of a car, and to do such things as cause acceleration when the driver doesn't want acceleration, to throw on the brakes when the driver doesn't want the brakes on, to launch an air bag," Clarke told The Huffington Post. "You can do some really highly destructive things now, through hacking a car, and it's not that hard."

It's possible that Hastings car was hacked considering the people he had written about in his past and what he recently had been tlaking about.

Kathleen Fisher from DARPA recently did a presentation on the ease of hacking a standard american sedan. Volvo started the SARTRE (Safe Road Trains for the Environment) program in 2009 and they are now reporting that their testing has been "successfully completed." Hacking of a lemmings train like Volvo's, could lead to massive collisions on the roads and there should be major security concerns considering what recently has been learned.

Title: Andrew Johnson's False "Disinformation" Claim Against Red Ice Radio
Date: 2013-06-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=GY-Nr9OGmzk
Description: In a recent article by Andrew Johnson, he claims that Red Ice Radio is part of a "9/11 Disinformation Promotion Brigade." In this commentary Henrik Palmgren explains why Andrew is wrong in his accusations. A common misconception and trap that many people fall into when contradicting material is presented, is to assume that it's designed to intentionally or unwittingly mislead or otherwise attempt to confuse the audience. It is neither to confuse nor intentionally spread "disinformation" as Andrew suggests. The process of letting the audience actively participate in the research process on their own is done for very intentional purposes. We believe that this is the most effective way of letting everyone utilize their critical abilities; as opposed to being spoon fed a biased, slanted view. Presenting opposing viewpoints is essential for people who want to both exercise their ability to deduct and choose what material they themselves want to further research and verify. Red Ice Radio, has from the start, held a position that nothing presented on the program should be perceived as the ultimate truth. We have frequently mentioned in our programs and commentaries that the purpose and function of this approach is not to offer a preconceived idea, but instead it forces people to think for themselves about every issue they hear. We think that the ability to make a judgment about the material should fall in the hands of the audience, not the program directors, editors or hosts

In the second hour, we'll discuss Angelina Jolie's preventative double mastectomy. It's highly likely that this is all a part of a major push into thinking that genes are everything. We'll talk about what that could imply and how it would manifest in society. Anthony explains how the transhumanistic view of genetically manipulating humanity is the ultimate physical and spiritual enslavement. He describes what could be Stalin 2.0 with robot-like humans in the future. We end the hour on Adam Kokesh and what could go very wrong if the armed march on Washington happens.

He'll explain Neanderthal Predation (NP) theory revealing that Neanderthals were 'apex' predators who resided at the top of the food chain and everything, including humans was their prey. Danny explains how Neanderthals are the origins of our deep source of fear. Vendramini suggests that Eurasian Neanderthals abducted, raped and interbred with early humans in the Middle East producing hybrids. We'll discuss sexual predation, the most important aspect of his theory, when mating drastically changed bringing forth romantic love. He also explains how Neanderthals jump started our evolution into the modern human. In the second hour we'll speak more on the disappearance of the Neanderthal from the historical record. Danny continues on selection pressure for strategic adaptations, including cognitive ability, male aggression, language capacity, gender roles and creativity. We end the hour on the sad consequences of predation, deeply engrained into our consciousness. He explains how awareness is fundamental.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Robert W. Sullivan - Hour 1 - The Royal Arch of Enoch
Date: 2013-05-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=89VxrsJRClM
Description: Robert Sullivan is a philosopher, historian, antiquarian, jurist, theologian, writer, and a lawyer. He is a Freemason, having joined Amicable-St. John's Lodge #25, Baltimore Maryland in 1997; he became a 32nd degree Scottish Rite Mason in 1999, Valley of Baltimore, Orient of Maryland. "The Royal Arch of Enoch: The Impact of Masonic Ritual, Philosophy, and Symbolism" is his first published work and is the result of twenty years of research. We'll discuss freemasonic lore, rituals, ceremonies and the deities surrounding the Royal Arch Degree. Also, we discuss the history of battling secret societies, philosophies of pro-papal Jesuits and warring anti-royal aristocratic masons. Later, Robert explains the origins of Enoch and Enochian magic. In the member's hour, Robert speaks about Freemasonry in the past vs. today, a very different world, although only 20 years ago. Then we talk about the criticism of freemasonry and the anti-Masonic party, which was the first third party in the US. Later in the second hour, Robert defines Masonic symbolism and the "God" of the Royal Arch Degree: Jahbulon. He explains how there is a force operating in the world that is highly knowledgeable of esoteric symbolism, astrology and Kabbalism, which organizes and arranges big public events and the commissioning of buildings with certain architectural features. At the end of the hour, we speak more about Enochian magic, based on the art of John Dee and Edward Kelley. If people in the past have been evoking angels to do their work, or if they, the angels have been using us for their agenda, maybe mankind is being played on multiple levels.

Title: Radio 3Fourteen - Jon Rappoport - The Artist Against the System
Date: 2013-05-24
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Gw3duVSLLwI
Description: Jon Rappoport is an investigative journalist, author and publisher of the web site nomorefakenews.com. He has worked as an investigative reporter for 30 years, writing articles on politics, medicine, and health. Although his main focus over these years has been the power of the imagination and creativity, he is most often cited and interviewed on conspiracies and global elites. In this interview, we discuss illusions within the matrix and the manufacturing of "reality" by the priest class, politicians and kings. Jon says the formulas of control are old, but underneath is the replacement of the imagination. Then, we focus on the power of the individual, creative artist who taps into something beyond the matrix. The artist opposes the trend of the collective. Jon discusses the absurd idea of a rainbow philosophy that pretends to include everyone but the artist knows that all such harmonies wear out and are eventually co-opted to produce mass hypnosis. We'll discuss the collective in its various guises and how it seeks to swallow up people and sweep away resistance. Later, Jon speaks about family programming and anti-self messages coming out of Hollywood. The path of the self is one that is viewed as a dangerous path; it is one to be fixed with drugs and psychiatry. Jon addresses the real power of the one apart from the group, free of mind control but operating within his/her own reality. It is the artist who destroys the matrix over and over. From this perspective, Jon gives his vision of the future, despite the collective and manufactured realities by matrix insiders.

Description: Patrick Henningsen, an independent journalist currently based in London, is the managing editor of 21st Century Wire, which delivers news and expos鳠on intelligence, foreign policy, climate change, the war on terror, technology and Wall Street. Besides demonstrating freedom speech and thought, one of the main intentions of 21st Century Wire is to empower readers by giving them the tools to decode mainstream propaganda. In the first hour, we'll discuss the Boston bombings. We speculate on how the Tsarnaev brothers, possibly on the FBI payroll, were set up. Then, we talk about the independent investigations on the Internet into the bombings from sites such as Reddit and 4chan. When the public presented the FBI with suspect evidence, they were dismissed. We also cover the pressure cooker debacle. We end the first hour on the bigger geopolitical game with focus on the Middle East. In the second hour, we discuss government regulation of the media, which is now extending onto bloggers in Europe. Patrick talks the problem, reaction, solution scenario and how a centralized dictatorship run by government bureaucrats, lobbied by big companies will eliminate all competition and independence and destroy the middle class of small business owners. We'll tie in the Nordic model of government and the clever conspiracy of pushing "corporate socialism" or "capitalist communism" as the third way of control. Lastly, we touch upon the economic take over in southern Europe and tensions ramping up with Korea.

In the first hour, Harry tells the story of how this discovery unfolded, the characters involved and how he arrived on the scene. Harry and fellow researchers were able to amass large quantities of information from the artifacts as to who the people were that constructed the "Illinois Mystery Cave" and the identities of the corpses who lay interred within it, which he'll talk about. We'll also discuss what others have found in the same area, actually called "Little Egypt." Harry comments on the mainstream archaeological community and the suppression of America's true history. In the second hour, we delve deep into what is depicted on the artifacts, including strange but highly detailed images of humanoids, aliens, UFOs and more.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Ole Dammeg岤 - Hour 1 - The Assassination of Olof Palme - Part 4
Date: 2013-05-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=a9kijdKoBVw
Description: Writer, former-journalist, artist and musician Ole Dammeg岤 returns to continue our series on the assassination of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, as detailed in his book "Coup d'etat in Slow motion." Previously in part 1, 2 and 3, Ole uncovered the inconsistencies in the official story, including hidden facts behind the assassination. He spoke about the patsy, Christer Pettersson, an innocent alcoholic, who was framed as the murderer and sentenced for the crime. In this last installment, Ole presents a theory that takes the entire story to a whole new level. Olof Palme had been playing a double role for years, outwardly being the protector of the weak and poor, while at the same time invisibly serving the banking elite. Ole suggests that at one of the elite's discreet sex-parties, the former prime minister was infected with HIV. Palme made the decision to fake his own death and end his political career instead of letting the news of his disease go public, causing a major international scandal. Towards the end of his political career, he did everything he could to clean up his act, getting rid of evidence that could lead to scandals, which would smear his name. Dammeg岤 outlines the confusion that arose when two different assassination teams got in each other's way. What was supposed to be a fake assassination turned out to be a real one. The Swedish government and police prevented witnesses and withheld evidence, which revealed the plans of a fake assassination. All real investigators were pushed aside, exchanged by inside people trusted from the highest levels.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Troy McLachlan & Theodore Holden - Antique Solar System, Neanderthals & Modern Man
Date: 2013-05-15
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-p10PiJPEq4
Description: Authors Troy D. McLachlan and Theodore A. Holden will discuss their new book, Cosmos in Collision, which concentrates on events in the solar system before the arrival of Saturn and its accompanying planets, including Earth. Ted and Troy propose that the Jupiter moon Ganymede was once a liquid water world with an oxygen atmosphere fully capable of supporting life (including humans) as we know it. With Jupiter having once been in a much closer orbit to the Sun, Ganymede was warmed by both the sun and Jupiter, the latter being at that time a sub-brown dwarf similar to ancient Saturn. They have dubbed this era of our Solar System's history as the Antique Solar System epoch. They also propose a new theory for planet formation. This theory is based on the Herbig-Haro objects observed throughout the galaxy. They will also introduce the concept of a Paleolithic conflict between Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals in which Neanderthals are controversially depicted as predatory hominids according to Danny Vendramini's theories. Troy and Ted will contrast the superbly nocturnally adapted Neanderthal to Cro-Magnons during the Purple Dawn era and come to the inescapable conclusion that modern humans (Cro-Magnons) are not native to this planet. They believe they may have found a world within our solar system that once served as humanity's original home world (Ganymede).

Description: Ralph Ellis has been researching biblical and Egyptian history for more than 30 years. Being independent from theological and educational establishments allows Ralph to tread where others do not dare, and it is through this independence that Ralph has made many new biblical and historical discoveries. He returns to discuss his latest book, Jesus, King of Edessa. Ralph will talk about the Edessa family, a royal family most have never heard about. Ralph has discovered that one of the princes of Edessa had the same names as Jesus. We'll discuss Josephus Flavius as a historian who worked for the Romans writing their propaganda, deleting the Edessa family. Ralph will explain how manufactured biblical gospel is still a version of the truth, written using the pesher technique. In the member's hour, we'll continue on the omphalos stone found in the Temple of Delphi, reputed to have been a conical meteoric stone that arrived in a dramatic and fiery fashion from the heavens above. Ralph talks about where else we can find stories about stones with magical properties. Then, we'll hear about royals with cone-heads and where else we see this in history. Was the conical Edessan crown also designed to cover and conceal an elongated royal cone-head? Ralph entertains ideas of ancient astronauts. Later, we'll return to the motives of Joseph Flavius, a possible double agent. Ralph explains how the writings of Flavius have taken humanity on a diversion from gnosis.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=F2sXGlqfXv8
Description: Dean Clifford's journey with unraveling the legal system and finding freedom started over a decade ago when the Canada Revenue Agency came after him for not filing taxes in which they demanded him to pay over 3 times his earning. This wasn't acceptable with him and so he set out to find out how governments manage to force their policy onto the people with impunity. What he discovered was mind blowing. Since then, he has managed to correct his status and undo almost every deceitful contract he was originally tricked into. The CRA is still unable to prosecute him. Dean delivers seminars, conducts interviews and gives consultations about his discoveries and his lawful remedy in addition to his contracting business. He returns to detail his recent arrest in Canada where he was then held in a maximum security prison in solitary confinement for his political beliefs. He'll explain how he was released without prosecution, proving his research and method to be true. Then, we'll discuss the difference between natural law and artificial law. Dean talks about the importance of knowing your natural rights. In the second hour, we discuss our current government model system and the ridiculous notion that society cannot exist without government. We'll discuss how government is our creation gone mad but buried underneath still exists natural law. At the end of the day there is only mankind, no government. Later, Dean deconstructs the biggest freeman myth, the idea that money is evil. The hour ends on the importance of you as an individual to counteract all lies, agendas and governments. Evil triumphs when good men do nothing. Dean talks about what is next in his case against Canada and their recent human rights violations against him. He'll also address fear mongers and say why the U.S. won't wage war on its people.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=0g5RlbFqPFo
Description: Ian R Crane is an ex-oilfield executive who now lectures, writes and broadcasts on the geo-political webs that are being spun, with particular focus on US Hegemony and the NWO agenda for control of global resources. Primarily Ian focuses his attention and research on the geopolitical arena but has a deep personal interest in folklore, mythology and the cosmological belief systems of ancient and indigenous cultures. In this program, we'll discuss fracking or hydraulic fracturing, the process of forcing open fissures in subterranean rocks, specifically oil and gas rich shale, to be able to extract it. There are many problems with this procedure, causing serious side effects. Ian will detail a few of these effects. We'll also discuss the globalist financial war against mankind and the systematic destruction of various cultures around Europe. Cyprus, Ireland and Sweden have all been decimated since they joined the European Union. In the second hour with Ian, we will continue to discuss the systematic destruction of the ecosystem and how despite the green wave and environmentalism, projects like Agenda 21 are about moving people out of the rural areas and into cities. Fracking is something that aids this more than anything else, making large areas uninhabitable, forcing people off their land where they can live as they please. Later, we'll talk about the Georgia Guidestones, the underlying agenda, the game of monopoly, corporate fascism and crony capitalism. Government claims to keep us safe by rules, laws and regulation but fail on every level, all the while sanctioning bad behavior.

Matt and Robert produced a video series explaining in great detail, the collective works of Dr. Walter and Lao Russell; specifically the final distillation of the science and philosophy as written in the book "Atomic Suicide." Walter Russell was an American polymath and a natural philosopher known for his unified theory in physics and cosmogony. Dr. Russell said that one of the best things to ever happen in his life was "being taken out of school before he was ruined," which allowed him to conceive his "knowing" within the light of Universal Mind (The Creator) directly. In the first hour, we'll discuss Russellian science, which presents a new concept of the universe, one in unity with nature and the Creator. In the second hour, we delve into more detail on the principles of creation and the nature of our universe. Robert critiques the academic sciences, including quantum physics and the new age ideas which have sprung out of it. We'll also hear about Frank Chester's empirical research proving the validity of Russellian science. Later, we'll discuss Walter Russell's blueprint for a free energy device and his proposal to NORAD in the 1960's. The hour ends on a discussion about psychopaths who uphold "explodemia science."

Title: Red Ice Radio - Mikael Jalving - Hour 1 - Absolut Sweden: A Country Undergoing Change
Date: 2013-02-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=GAvAo0vQ19U
Description: Michael Jalving is a Danish commentator, writer, lecturer and political debater. He writes for Jyllands Posten, which a few years ago published the famous Muhammad cartoons, which led to international controversy and burning of embassies. The newspaper announced that this publication was an attempt to contribute to the debate regarding criticism of Islam and self-censorship. Jalving previously published the book "Me and Muhammad" but he is best known in Sweden for his book, "Absolute Sweden - a country undergoing change," which we'll discuss in this program. The book is critical of mass immigration and takes a deeper look at the troubled past and worrying future of Scandinavia's big brother. In the second hour we discuss Sweden's role in World War II and the so called neutrality, while selling iron ore and ball bearings to both sides of the war. The problem of Sweden extends way beyond the current issues of mass immigration and we'll try to get to the root of the ongoing cultural erosion which is currently taking place. Michael will talk about the economic success Sweden experienced in the 70's - somewhat of an enigma considering that it was a quasi-socialist welfare state that was dictated by Olof Palme and his minions, where social engineering or social planning was one of the most important driving ideologies at that time and still is. We'll go deeper into the psychology of a nation, which thinks it can control all conflict - detached from reality and nature. Jalving continues on anti-individual Jante Law and how it has shaped the country as well as the concept of the "folkhome," a utopian and egalitarian ideology that sought to perfect the state and the collective within it. The ant like society of the 60s and 70s marched on towards a totalitarian collectivist state and it even went so far as to nationalize or socialize the profits of private companies. Later, we move on to talk about the rise of right wing parties in Europe and ask why. We'll also discuss why freedom of speech is under threat and censorship and surveillance is on the rise.

Description: Paul has developed a unique and creative vehicle to introduce people to the dream-like nature of reality that he calls "The Dreaming Up Process." Paul is a pioneer in the field of spiritual emergence, as well as an innovator in the field of dreaming. He returns to discuss his latest book Dispelling Wetiko. In the first hour, we'll recap on "wetiko," a contagious psycho spiritual disease of the soul, a parasite of the mind that is currently being acted out en masse on the world stage via a collective psychosis of titanic proportions. This mind-virus, which Native Americans have called "wetiko" covertly operates through the unconscious blind spots in the human psyche, rendering people oblivious to their own madness and compelling them to act against their own best interests. Paul discusses how to deal with the collective psychosis and explains the upside to the madness. He talks about what can dissolve wetiko and change the dream, bringing about an alchemical experience. In the second hour, Paul discusses nightmares and recognizing what is being revealed. We talk about symbols, synchronicities, creativity and the power of words. Later, Levy talks about government being under the spell of wetiko. He explains how seeing through the lens of pessimism creates a feedback loop. On the flip side there is the curse of our optimism. Don't miss this terrific two hour interview.

Date: 2013-02-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=09pMAsTeBk8
Description: Curt Flowers and Damon Charles from Executive Trustee Training discuss the practicalities of taking control of your life and becoming your own boss in a world of never ending ideologies and conspiracies. Curt and Charles present a refreshing viewpoint on how to improve the quality of life both mentally and physically. Their message is one of mental, physical and spiritual independence regardless of the current state of the world. They talk about why complaining and demanding others to change or behave differently is not the answer. We'll discuss the illusions of manmade constructs such as government, authority and credit and address the general state of mind control and laziness as the big obstacle preventing us from creating something new. Curt explains the importance of understanding the meaning of words and asking the right questions when dealing with opposing forces. We also philosophize about concepts such as human "rights," justice and the need for a governing body as opposed to letting the forces of nature or natural law sort things out.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Rupert Sheldrake - The Science Delusion
Date: 2013-01-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=GsSUqVpwUK4
Description: British biologist Dr. Rupert Sheldrake, one of the world's most innovative scientists, is the author of more than 80 scientific papers and ten books and is best known for his groundbreaking theory of morphic resonance. In this program we discuss Rupert's latest book "The Science Delusion." He begins with an overview of the ten dogmas of science. According to these dogmas, all of reality is material or physical, the world is an inanimate machine, nature is purposeless, free will is an illusion, notions of higher orders of consciousness and absolute "God" awareness exists only as ideas in human minds, which are themselves nothing but electrochemical processes imprisoned within our skulls. These powerful assumptions, have led science down the wrong path according to Rupert. He explains how originally the scientific field held a kind of Cartesian dualistic view of spirit and matter, which eventually was replaced solely by matter. The scientific view that matter is "dead" and has no soul or spirit is dangerous, argues Sheldrake. Later, we talk about the Large Hadron Collider, the most expensive scientific project in the history of mankind. Rupert explains that the results in the search for the "Higgs field" and the so called "God particle" might very well be influenced by the intention of the scientists performing the experiment, also known as the observer's effect. Lastly, Sheldrake tells us about the biotech bubble and shares his opinion on what alternative fields of science he would like to see funded.

Description: In this special two hour program, we discuss the disturbing story of a child, Domenic Johansson who was abducted by Swedish social services over ludicrous claims. The child's father Christer Johansson explains the outrageous actions by the Swedish government. Christer and his wife Annie wanted to homeschool their child as he did not feel well in the noisy state school. At this time, homeschooling was still legal in Sweden. The family had planned to move abroad to India, Annie's home country and take part in humanitarian work, bringing their son. The then-7-year-old homeschooler was abducted from an airplane bound for India by police after his parents refused to stop educating him at home - and that was in June of 2009. The boy remains in state custody, completely isolated from his parents. We'll discuss the inhumane, cruel treatment of Domenic and his parents and the lie that says Sweden is the "social utopia." We uncover the dirty tyrannical government of a seemingly ok society. Christer also mentions that he is not alone. Thousands of children have been taken by Swedish authorities for ridiculous reasons, one because the mother "talked too much on the phone." Where are the children? Why aren't Swedes saying anything?

Description: What is the secret agenda of high level Freemasonry? Listen to this excerpt from our Red Ice Radio program with Christopher Knight from July 2011 for a fascinating and disturbing insight. 

BBC's articles "Would you want to be a Freemason?" http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17272611 & "Freemasons: Your questions answered" http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17357150 is more or less a recruitment campaign. We wrote "BBC Continues Recruitment Campaign for the Freemasons - What is Really Going on Inside the Brotherhood?" http://www.redicecreations.com/article.php?id=19170 to address this. 

Christopher became a Freemason in 1976. Today he believes there is a Masonic agenda, yet another group is pulling the strings. We talk about the founding of America as the Masonic experiment and Washington, DC as Zion and the Pentagon as the Stonehenge of USA, designed according to ancient megalithic measurements. Maryland and Virginia flank DC as goddess worship is an important part of Freemasonry. Chris will also discuss the Masonic belief about The New Jerusalem and Yahweh coming back to rule the Earth.

Description: Laird Scranton is an independent software designer who became interested in Dogon mythology and symbolism in the early 1990s. He has studied ancient myth, language, and cosmology since 1997 and has been a lecturer at Colgate University. He also appears in John Anthony West's Magical Egypt DVD series. He returns to Red Ice to discuss his new book, The Velikovsky Heresies which includes several important new pieces of evidence which argue in favor of Immanuel Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision theories, now more than 60 years old. We'll discuss the possible ejection of Venus from Jupiter, the discovery of a comet-like tail on Venus and the discovery that comets are comprised of a mix of materials that - if formed according to traditional theory - could only have formed at widely varying distances from the sun. The same materials are now known to exist side-by-side within the atmosphere of Jupiter. This argues that some short-period comets may have originated (as Velikovsky proposes) inside Jupiter. Laird examines each discreet aspect of Velikovsky's theory and updates its reasonableness from the perspective of recent scientific findings.

Description: Paul is a pioneer in the field of spiritual emergence, as well as an innovator in the field of dreaming, a Tibetan Buddhist practitioner for over 30 years and the author of The Madness of George Bush: A Reflection of Our Collective Psychosis, as well as the book we'll discuss, Wetiko: The Greatest Epidemic Sickness Known to Humanity. Paul says our species is clearly in the middle of a mass psychic epidemic, which he calls malignant egophrenia and Native Americans call wetiko psychosis. There is a psycho-spiritual disease of the soul whose origin is within ourselves that has the potential either to destroy our species or wake us up, depending upon whether or not we recognize what it is revealing to us. We'll discuss how Wetiko operates, what it needs and how it mutates. Paul talks about co-collective creation, our unconscious mind and shadow self. He also explains how Wetiko can actually be the greatest gift.

Date: 2012-03-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=m6S3SANk6bU
Description: Carl Munck created the science of "archaeocryptograpy," a study of the underlying mathematical order beneath the proportions, size, and placement of the world's sacred sites. Carl claims there is incontrovertible evidence of precise global positioning, thousands of years ago, requiring space age technologies, and satellite triangulation. His website provides introductory examples of how ancient monuments encode their positions in the matrix. Carl will tell the story of how he was taken in an alien ship over the Nazca Lines in 1982. He learned their form of math, which he says was not meant for us to decode yet he has cracked some of the codes. These aliens use complicated math to reveal their location. We'll talk about how sacred sites were used for much more than mapping. Carl will mention some of the lesser known sacred sites and explain a bit about base 360 math. He says the universe is tied together by "maps and tangents." We end the interview with comments from Carl about 2012, crop circles and critique of his work.

Description: Joseph Atwill is an independent scholar who has set the world of New Testament scholarship in a new direction. In his book "Caesar's Messiah - The Roman Conspiracy to Invent Jesus", Atwill outlines the series of events in Jesus' ministry that are parallels with the events of the battle campaign of Titus Flavius as recorded by Josephus Flavius in "War of the Jews". Numerous scholars had noticed the parallels between the Gospels and Josephus' work before, but Atwill is the first to notice that all the parallels take place in exact sequence and draw a revolutionary conclusion. Follow along in this program as Atwill contends these correlations, talks about linguistic typology and the reasons why the imperial Cult of Rome, with the Flavians at the center, wanted to invent the story of Jesus Christ for their own benefit.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Troy McLachlan - Hour 1 - The Crimes of The Saturn Death Cult
Date: 2012-02-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=aiNiD9wFJyw
Description: Troy McLachlan returns to Red Ice Radio to finish up the program series on "The Saturn Death Cult". Our focus shifts from the mechanics of the Saturn system and the polar conjunction to the crimes of the Saturn death cult. Troy outlines his theory that explains why today's frightening sex-murder cults and secret societies are nothing more than a twisted, yet deadly legacy of a time when people yearned for the rebirth of the planet Saturn as our original sun and source of life and light. This is linked to the ancient practice of money lending and the consequences of this practice for today's international financial crisis. The conclusion is reached that there is a disturbing occult connection to the planet Saturn and its influence over a perceived worldwide collective march towards fulfilling a terrifying elitist agenda of 'justifiable' global genocide. "The Saturn Death Cult" discusses the existence of a worldwide malevolent occult culture that is fundamentally flawed to its core by an erroneous understanding of the ritualistic and mythological traditions surrounding the planet and god Saturn. This subsequently casts certain Saturnian-based occult groups and secret societies in a vastly different light where their trans-humanistic agendas are exposed for the fraudulent, yet dangerous nonsense they are - a set of rogue belief systems completely devoid of all legitimacy in their claims and ambitions to seek influence over the affairs of mankind.

Date: 2012-02-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=62XVxuQGRtY
Description: A British national brought up in New Zealand, Troy McLachlan earned a bachelor's degree in Asian and American politics before embarking on an advertising and television/film industry career in both New Zealand and later in Hong Kong where he was a resident for fifteen years. Fascinated by the cosmology of the Electric Universe hypotheses and its ability to provide rational and natural explanations for the mythological record, Troy recognised that a discussion of the model's implications and their affects on the practises of prevailing occult belief systems was largely missing within Electric Universe literature. Recognising that the god Saturn plays an important role in some of the world's more deviant esoteric traditions he wrote the website and kindle-book 'The Saturn Death Cult' as an attempt to forge a link between the implications of 'Saturn Theory' and its detrimental effect on the beliefs of certain Saturnian-based occult groups and agendas. The Saturn Death Cult is an investigation into ancient planetary upheavals that heralded the birth and destruction of a fabled Golden Age. It attempts to trace how, following the demise of this Golden Age, mankind then degenerated into the obsessive pursuit of wealth and power through the perverted horrors of slavery, child sacrifice and mass-murder rituals.

Description: David Talbott, a comparative mythologist whose work offers a radical new vantage point on the origin of ancient cultural themes and symbols, is the primary catalyst behind the "Saturn Model." He also proposes a "Polar Configuration," inspired by Immanuel Velikovsky involving the five planets Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, Mars and Earth. He claims that in ancient times the five planets orbited the Sun as a single linear unit, which rotated about a point close to Saturn, before its break-up at the end of the Golden Age. He claims that the violent evolution of this "Polar Configuration" provoked the myth-making epoch of human history. David will explain his theory and how he utilizes points of agreement between cultures to reconstruct our past. We'll discuss the "great conjunction," the birth of myth and symbols and the turning sky. David is also the co-author (with Wallace Thornhill) of Thunderbolts of the Gods and The Electric Universe.

Nick is the author of: "The NASA Conspiracies", "Memoirs of a Monster Hunter", "Strange Secrets: Real Government Files on the Unknown", "On the Trail of the Saucer Spies: UFO's and Government Surveillance" and "Contactees" among others. In this program we focus on his latest book "The Real Men In Black: Evidence, Famous Cases, and True Stories of These Mysterious Men and their Connection to UFO Phenomena". We begin our discussion about the people at the root of the men in black phenomena: Albert K. Bender, Gray Barker and John Keel. Then, we talk about some of the most interesting cases, reports and theories. Are the men in black simply government agents or could they be aliens, human genetic experiments, hybrids, clones, robots, time travelers or agents from an alien race? Since they often are reported in connection to UFO sightings, one of the more common theories about them is that they are sent out to warn eyewitnesses not to discuss their sightings. In other cases, because of their odd behavior, their mission seems to be to discredit the eyewitness of a UFO. We run through the different possibilities and discuss references made in movies and TV-shows and their influence on the phenomena.

Description: Update: "Crater" found. See more here: http://www.redicecreations.com/article.php?id=16257 

Is the official story about the Oslo bombings correct? Is the media and the police giving us the full story? 

Looking at the available photographs and video, is there physical evidence of a 900 - 1500 kilo fertilizer bomb, going off inside of a Volkswagen Crafter, parked between the H-Block building and R4 building at the government quarters in Oslo? 

What if the explosion came from underground? What if there was multiple explosions? Can the car bomb story be a cover? Perhaps even worse, what if an unconventional weapon was used? 

These are just some of the question that arise after you examine the available evidence.

Description: Richard C. Hoagland is a former museum space science Curator, a former NASA Consultant and was science advisor to Walter Cronkite and CBS News. In the early 1970's, Hoagland proposed to Carl Sagan (along with Eric Burgess) the placement of a "message to Mankind" aboard Pioneer 10 -- humanity's "first" unmanned probe of Jupiter. Since then he has been pioneering the pursuit of uncovering the hidden data of our solar system. He is the author of several books, probably most famous for his theories on the face on Mars. His website enterprisemission.com, is updated regularly with analytical research into current anomalies on our planet and way beyond. In this interview, Richard shares his convincing theory about Comet Elenin, its symbolism, purpose and message which is a positive one. He rips apart the fear-porn propaganda about Comet Elenin as this is a key point in time and someone or something is intervening to steer consciousness into another direction. Could it be that Elenin is a time capsule sent by our ancestors containing important information crucial for this time? Then, Hoagland weaves together an intense eye-opener which connects Comet Elenin with September 11, the original masonic message, the bombing in Norway and the secret space program.

Description: John Anthony Hill, also known as Muad'Dib is the producer of the film "7/7 Ripple Effect". The film disputes the official account of the July 7, 2005 London bombings (also known as 7/7), a terrorist attack on public transport in Central London, by four suicide bombers later named as Hasib Hussain, Germaine Lindsay, Shehzad Tanweer, and Mohammad Sidique Khan. The film was first released on the Internet on November 5, 2007, two years after the attacks. Physical copies were also sent to many of the people connected with the attacks. The film implicates the Metropolitan Police and Tony Blair, and claims that the true perpetrators of the attacks were MI5 and/or Mossad, who tricked the four men into travelling to London with rucksacks, in order to provide CCTV footage later to be used as evidence in the investigation of the attacks. It alleges that the four bombers were actually murdered in Canary Wharf, and did not die as suicide bombers in the explosions on the three tube trains and one bus where the attacks took place. John Anthony Hill was arrested in Ireland for the "crime" of sending DVD's of the film to the judge and jury of the first trial of three men: Waheed Ali, 25, Sadeer Saleem, 28, and Mohammed Shakil, 32, who were being tried at Kingston Crown Court, England. Muad'Dib was accused of "attempting to pervert the course of justice", when he sent copies of it to those in charge of delivering a verdict. In this interview, John Anthony Hill will discuss his film, the theories behind the attacks, his arrest and court case. He'll also convey his next plan to challenge the court system.

Description: Jordan Maxwell continues as a preeminent researcher and independent scholar in the field of occult / religious philosophy. His work on the subject of secret societies, both ancient and modern, and their symbols, has fascinated audiences around the world for decades. Considering the rapidly moving events of today, and the very real part that hidden religious agendas play in our modern war-torn world, he feels these controversial subjects are not only interesting to explore, but too important to ignore!

Description: Richard Dolan is considered by many students of the UFO phenomenon to be the pre-eminent historian of the subject. He is the author of two volumes of history, UFOs and the National Security State, as well as an analysis of the future, A.D. After Disclosure: The People's Guide to Life After Contact. Richard's writing is widely seen as ufology's gold standard. A.D. After Disclosure, which Richard co-authored with Bryce Zabel (the creator of the television series Dark Skies), has been widely hailed as among the most original works in all of UFO literature, a fearless and analytical "what if" scenario that discusses the deep impact that would be brought about by the end of UFO secrecy. Among Richard's main themes are the destruction of our political liberties as a result of the UFO cover-up, the possible nature of the non-humans themselves, and what their presence here means for our civilization. This has led him to take a fresh approach to the topic of "Exopolitics" and to develop unique insights into the practical challenges and opportunities for a true disclosure of the UFO phenomenon. Richard, born in Brooklyn, New York, studied at Alfred University and Oxford University, was a finalist for a Rhodes scholarship, and completed his graduate work in history at the University of Rochester. Prior to his interest in UFOs, he studied U.S. Cold War strategy, Soviet history and culture, and international diplomacy.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Ralph Ellis - The Biblical Shepherd Kings & The Egyptian Hyksos Pharaohs
Date: 2011-03-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3ris3YCcmYk
Description: 舩storical cover-ups have always been a topic of interest. We re-visit the work of Ralph Ellis, who joins us to discuss his series of six books on the topic of "Biblical Patriarchs as Royal Pharaohs of Egypt". Ralph has been researching biblical and Egyptian history for more than 30 years. Being independent from theological and educational establishments has allowed him to tread where others do not dare, and it is through this independence that Ralph has discovered so many new biblical and historical clues about what might be the truth. Perhaps one of the biggest 'cover-ups' is the fact that the Israelites were originally Egyptians, the Hyksos shepherd pharaohs who were ejected from Egypt in the 17th century BC. But this simple correlation colors the rest of biblical history, for it means that both King Solomon and Jesus were also of Egyptian heritage. We begin to look at many of the missing historical characters and re examine the timeline, the placing and in some cases the naming of certain biblical and Egyptian historical events. Topics Discussed: missing historical characters, Adam and Eve, sheperd kings, Old Testament, reassessment of biblical history, victimhood, Babylon exile, Egypt, the historical propaganda story, Judaism "light", persecution of the Christians, church of Jesus, Judaism, Eden in Egypt, the Nile, Amarna, El, Elohim, Yahweh, Akhenaton and Nefertiti, the Gen esis story, two main exoduses, revolutionaries, horrible living conditions in Amarna, pyramids, astrology, precession, messiah, Thoth, chronologies of the pharaohs, Saul, St Paul, Josephus and more.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=DeCYpmtVN98
Description: "The Venus Project" was started in the mid-1970s by social engineer, industrial designer, futurist and inventor Jacque Fresco and his partner, Roxanne Meadows. The project focuses on holistic design of sustainable cities, energy efficiency, natural resource management and advanced automation. Don't miss this program if you are curious to know more about "The Venus Project". It's been highlighted in the film "Zeitgeist Addendum" and the consequent "Zeitgeist Movement" have attracted millions of people worldwide. We approach the subject and some of our questions about the Venus project from the point of view of how they plan to implement some of their ideas and how the system would be put in place if they had free hands to do so. We talk about a resource based economy, city design, transportation, new technology, engineering think on problem solving, computers systems, artificial intelligence and robots that take care of a lot of the management in and around cities. How would a transition over to something like "The Venus Project" look like? What is some of the philosophy behind the ideas of the project and this interview might have some aspects and question that you haven't heard Jacque or Roxanne answer in other interviews. Topics Discussed: Peter Joseph's Zeitgeist Addendum, The Venus Project, Venus Florida, Survey, Coral Castle, Economy, Environment, Education, Politics, Money System, Energy Systems, Camera, Resource-Based Economy, Is there Enough Resources World Wide? Globalization, Corporations, Monetary System, Communism, Socialism, Fear of the Venus Project, Stephen Hawking, Alien, E.T., Earth Resources, Scarcity, Military, War, Upgrade, Society, Machine Takeover, Knowing System, Decision Making Computers, Robots, Stupid Jobs, Brain, Utopia, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Transition, Politicians, Nationalist, Nationalism, Money System, Break Down, Designs, Education, Geothermal Energy, Evolution, Civilization, Implementation through Force and more.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Jacque Fresco & Roxanne Meadows - Pt 6 - The Venus Project
Date: 2010-07-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=bqFZM59rjbo
Description: "The Venus Project" was started in the mid-1970s by social engineer, industrial designer, futurist and inventor Jacque Fresco and his partner, Roxanne Meadows. The project focuses on holistic design of sustainable cities, energy efficiency, natural resource management and advanced automation. Don't miss this program if you are curious to know more about "The Venus Project". It's been highlighted in the film "Zeitgeist Addendum" and the consequent "Zeitgeist Movement" have attracted millions of people worldwide. We approach the subject and some of our questions about the Venus project from the point of view of how they plan to implement some of their ideas and how the system would be put in place if they had free hands to do so. We talk about a resource based economy, city design, transportation, new technology, engineering think on problem solving, computers systems, artificial intelligence and robots that take care of a lot of the management in and around cities. How would a transition over to something like "The Venus Project" look like? What is some of the philosophy behind the ideas of the project and this interview might have some aspects and question that you haven't heard Jacque or Roxanne answer in other interviews.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Andrew Collins - Pt 6 - Beneath The Pyramids
Date: 2010-07-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1dSoHOw7PBk
Description: What is going on beneath the Giza plateau in Egypt? News has been coming out of underground cave systems that have been uncovered. There has also been rumors and stories about the secret archaeological excavations taking place in the vicinity of the Sphinx. Objects are rumored to have been taken out and a lot of speculation is going around on the web about this. So what is the truth? What is the story on this? We are going to begin to talk about the discovery of Giza's cave system, Egypt's "duat", the real underworld that exists underneath the pyramids. Andrew Collins is with us, the man who in modern times has re-discovered these. We hear the story of how he found the entrance to this natural cave system at the "tomb of the birds", located at the plateau's north cliff. Where does the story begin? Who discovered them first? How has Zahi Hawass of the Supreme Council of Antiquities dealt with this story? This is an explosive discovery that could rewrite the whole story of Egypt and how their underworld myths came about. Topics Discussed: Hall of Records, Henry Salt, Caviglia, Tombs, Sokar, Rostau, Edgar Cayce, Caves and Pyramids Under the Pyramids, Lion, Entrance, Mouth of the Passages, Giza, Nuit, Hathor, Duat, Tomb, Crystal, Diamond, Subterranean Chamber, The Edfu Texts, Myth of the Primordial Mound, The First Temple, Duat n Ba, Underworld of the Soul, "Bnnt" Antediluvian world, 11000 BC, Dogon, Southern Hill, Well, Memphis, and more. Don't miss hour two for more on the "secret excavation" rumors.

Description: We talk about Weather Warfare, Weather Manipulation, Chemtrails, Pollution and Environmental impact of Geo Engineering of the Climate with former meteorologist Scott Stevens who joins us to talk about the work that he has been doing at his website weatherwars.info. for the last few years. The website is a repository of photos, videos, explanations and theories about what is going on in our skies. We discuss the secret ongoing weather manipulating projects involving scalar waves, orgone energy and the big picture connected with this dark agenda. Topics Discussed: Tom Bearden, Scalar Waves, Contrails, Chemtrails, Weather Wars, Weather Modification, George Ure, Orgone Energy, Global Warming, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Elite, Conflicts, Economy, 2012, External Help, Contrails, Cloud Creation, "Oilicane", Hurricane Alex, Acoustic Blow Out Preventer Control System, Matthew Simmons, Peak Oil, Nukes, Haliburton, What is in the Trails? Resonant Geometry, Morgellons, Nanoparticles, Bacteria, Commercial Airplane Traffic, Alaska Airlines and more. We discuss the big picture behind weather manipulation and the connection to Orgone energy and spiritual warfare in the second hour. We talk about air traffic controllers speaking out, "the ballet in the sky", the absence of chemtrails during the Icelandic volcano eruption and the air flight ban. We discuss the energy tools used, scalar weaponry, resonance patterns, cymatics, Orgone energy and Wilhelm Reich. How the ether is being wrecked, where the technology of the elite comes from and the possibility that they have gotten help from the "outside", ET, what is the dark agenda? We wrap things up talking about ORMUS water or Blue Water Alchemy, monatomic elements, the energy body, the Rodin coil, Solfeggio tones and more.

How the ether is being wrecked, where the technology of the elite comes from and the possibility that they have gotten help from the "outside", ET, what is the dark agenda? We wrap things up talking about ORMUS water or Blue Water Alchemy, monatomic elements, the energy body, the Rodin coil, Solfeggio tones and more.

Description: Michael Cremo is the author of "Forbidden Archeology - The Hidden History of the Human Race" and "Human Devolution: A Vedic Alternative to Darwin's Theory". He joins us to talk about the Yuga cycle, Vedic cosmology, his theory of Human Devolution, reincarnation and if humanity is under quarantine. If we are in a cycle, then are we evolving or are we devolving? Topics Discussed: Reincarnation, Human Devolution, Cosmic Hierarchy or Beings, Stephen Hawkins, Sanskrit Calendar, Vedic Systems, 2012, Kali Yuga, How Long is one Yuga, Spiritual Beings, Oils Spill, Economic Collapse, Greed, Materialism, Control, Domination, Cooperation, Gold, OBE, Remote Viewing, NDE, Technology, Telepathy, Progress, Parapsychology, Stephan A Schwartz, Internet, Military Exploring Remote Viewing, Science & Matter, Video Games and more. Don't miss hour two with Michael Cremo for more on Human Devolution and the connection to his work on Forbidden Archeology. We talk about human origins, signs of intelligent life on this planet millions of years ago. Is our human experience a punishment? Are we in a prison or are we under quarantine? We talk about spiritual rehabilitation, reincarnation and how to be released from the cycle. We tie these ideas together with aspects of control and the conspiracy of the withholding information about humanities origin - and how we're programmed by evolution. Are we biological robots? We talk about governments, education, the cradle of human civilization in Sterkfontein in South Africa. We also discuss a few of Michael's favorite archeological anomalies from around the world like the Hematite spheres, billions of years old and human footprints also millions of years old. Don't miss our exciting second hour.

Do not miss these two very interesting hours. In the first hour we discuss: Phi, Giza Pyramids, Fibonacci Ratio, 1.45 Hertz, Prime Meridian, Cymatics, The Crop Circle Phenomenon, Crystallization of the Water, 2012, The Atlantis Properties, Age of the Pyramids & Sphinx, Pyramid Heart Beat Synchronization, Tri Thalamic Entrainment, Heart Mind Connection, Telepathic Ability, DNA, Sanskrit, Synchronization of Earth's Bell, Human Bio Rythms, Cellphone Towers, Acoustic Environment, Prayer, The DNA Helix, Inscom, Anastasia, Biorhythms, Daniel Tammet, Infrasound Waves, Quality of the Water, Emotion in the Heart, Electrum Water, Ayurvedic Waters, Cleaning up the Body, La Mana, Black Light Power and more. In our second hour with Alex we discuss grounding of the human body, illumination of your DNA and the special water with Gold and Silver particles, Electrum water. We also talk about the true vs. the false illuminati, the casing stones of the pyramids, what their properties are, how they were made, the flood and water from Mars. We process to discuss the changing energies are affecting Earth, anomalies taking place around the world in accordance to the standing wave ratio that Alex have mapped, unexplained fires, levitating stones and even strange animals are found. Are there changes happening to our DNA? We talk about the purpose of the pyramids - fire, light and their function. We get into 2012, magnetic reversal and Betelgeuse. This star has shockingly been shrinking more than 15 per cent since 1993! Is it going to go supernova in 2012? Will the effects of this potentially dying star reach us at this critical moment?

This star has shockingly been shrinking more than 15 per cent since 1993! Is it going to go supernova in 2012? Will the effects of this potentially dying star reach us at this critical moment?

Description: Richard C. Hoagland from the enterprisemission.com website and author or "The Monuments of Mars - A City on the Edge of Forever" and co-author of "Dark Mission: The Secret History of NASA" joins us to talk about Phobos, Mars, Ancient Civilizations, Ancient Cosmic Warfare and much more. Richard has popularized a lot of the very interesting ideas about an ancient civilization on Mars, he's probably most known for being one of the people looking really close at "the Face on Mars" and pointing out various finds, signs, structures and geometry between different landmarks, primarily in the Cydonia region, on Mars. We talk about 2010 - the year we make contact, the secret history of NASA, ET and disclosure. Topics Discussed: Censored Data, Arthur C Clark, 2010 - the year we make contact, Peter Hyams, Disclosure, Brookings Report, Independence Day, nature of the Data release about official disclosure, ancient artifacts, Phobos, Life on Mars, Freemason, Buzz Aldrin, Obelisk on Phobos, God, Disclosure, 2012, No Moon Hoax, Russian Phobos-Grunt Mission, Water leaking from Phobos, Rendezvous with Rama, Carl Sagan, Geometry, Phobos Cloaked Ship, Battlestar Galactica, The Hollow Moon, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactic, War in heaven, Star Treak, Russian Phobos 1 & 2, Secret Missions to Mars, NASA lies and more. Don't miss hour two with Richard C Hoagland for Red Ice Members. We continue to talk about secrets societies, the ancient priesthood "the Shemsu Hor" (the sons of Horus) and the slow trickle of information that is being released about our ancient past. We discuss timing, the cosmic clock, preservation and protection of knowledge, rivaling priesthoods, ancient cosmic warfare, The Norweigan spiral, Obama, disclosure, code, symbolism, The dawning of the "Age of Horus" and the Egyptian connection. We also talk about AT & T, Bell Comm, glass structures on the Moon and our use of fiber optics today. We wrap things up talking about the robot's head spotted on the Moon. What could the implication of this be if the data, the records and memory of the head could be extracted?

Title: Red Ice Radio - Walter Cruttenden - Pt 6 - Rise and Fall of Civilization and Consciousness
Date: 2010-05-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=pLtUZtY961Y
Description: We continue on the theme of solar system anomalies with Walter Cruttenden. In the past we've talked about planet-x, the destroyer star, cyclical catastrophe and strange effects linked with unknown bodies in or around our solar system. Walter is the author of "Lost Star of Myth and Time" and behind the Binary Research Institute that entertains the possibility that we are living in a binary star system with cyclical rise and fall of civilization and consciousness as an effect. Walter is an amateur theoretical archaeo-astronomer. He's been doing research on the celestial mechanics of the precession of the equinox, as well as myth and folklore related to this phenomenon. Topics discussed: A Companion to the sun, Rise and Fall of Civilization, Brown Dwarf, Dark Star, Black Hole, Ancient Stories, Rise and Fall of Civilization, Golden Age, Precession, Waxing and Waning of Light, Consciousness Affected by Light, Weakening Magnetic Field, More Advanced Cultures, Mesopotamia, Ancient Astronomy, Han Dynasty, The Olmecs, Technology is Manifestation of the Rise, Atlantis, Lemuria, High Culture, Myopic, Indians and Greek, 11.500 B.C High Culture, Akkadian Culture, Mesopotamian Culture, The Coming Dark Age, Stonehenge, Farming, Preservation of knowledge, Architecture, 500 A.D. Avebury Circle, Polarity of Stone, Stone Circle and Hadron Collider Similarities and more. We begin our second hour to talk briefly about Julian Jaynes, his theory of the Bicameral Mind and how that connects with some of the things that we've been talking about in the first hour with Walter. Then we really get into the main theory of Walter and the Binary Research Institute and we talk about Sirius, the crossing star. We talk about the important of Sirius in history, in mythology and religion, Isis and the chambers in the pyramids and the fact that Sirius doesn't seem to be moving with other stars. What has this to do with precession? We talk about how the sun and Sirius have a gravitational relationship. How does this work? We also talk about the fact that "the wobble" of the precession of the equinoxes seems to be off. We also talk about the Sirius Research Group and Karl-Heinz Homann and his son Uwe Homann who brings supporting evidence to Walter on this theory, Sirius is not moving. We discuss Pioneer 10 & 11 as they are entering the outer limits of our solar system and the gravitational anomalies that is happening. We talk more about mythology, technology and Walter's next book that will go into this like the emergence of an organic technology. Can we use trees and rocks as instruments for reading? We talk about the 12 Labors of Hercules, Jason and the Argonauts and the search for the Golden Fleece and some of the messages behind those stories. Don't miss hour with Walter Cruttenden.

Then we really get into the main theory of Walter and the Binary Research Institute and we talk about Sirius, the crossing star. We talk about the important of Sirius in history, in mythology and religion, Isis and the chambers in the pyramids and the fact that Sirius doesn't seem to be moving with other stars. What has this to do with precession? We talk about how the sun and Sirius have a gravitational relationship. How does this work? We also talk about the fact that "the wobble" of the precession of the equinoxes seems to be off. We also talk about the Sirius Research Group and Karl-Heinz Homann and his son Uwe Homann who brings supporting evidence to Walter on this theory, Sirius is not moving. We discuss Pioneer 10 & 11 as they are entering the outer limits of our solar system and the gravitational anomalies that is happening. We talk more about mythology, technology and Walter's next book that will go into this like the emergence of an organic technology. Can we use trees and rocks as instruments for reading? We talk about the 12 Labors of Hercules, Jason and the Argonauts and the search for the Golden Fleece and some of the messages behind those stories. Don't miss hour with Walter Cruttenden.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Walter Cruttenden - Pt 4 - Rise and Fall of Civilization and Consciousness
Date: 2010-05-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=pCAhK90_iUU
Description: We continue on the theme of solar system anomalies with Walter Cruttenden. In the past we've talked about planet-x, the destroyer star, cyclical catastrophe and strange effects linked with unknown bodies in or around our solar system. Walter is the author of "Lost Star of Myth and Time" and behind the Binary Research Institute that entertains the possibility that we are living in a binary star system with cyclical rise and fall of civilization and consciousness as an effect. Walter is an amateur theoretical archaeo-astronomer. He's been doing research on the celestial mechanics of the precession of the equinox, as well as myth and folklore related to this phenomenon. Topics discussed: A Companion to the sun, Rise and Fall of Civilization, Brown Dwarf, Dark Star, Black Hole, Ancient Stories, Rise and Fall of Civilization, Golden Age, Precession, Waxing and Waning of Light, Consciousness Affected by Light, Weakening Magnetic Field, More Advanced Cultures, Mesopotamia, Ancient Astronomy, Han Dynasty, The Olmecs, Technology is Manifestation of the Rise, Atlantis, Lemuria, High Culture, Myopic, Indians and Greek, 11.500 B.C High Culture, Akkadian Culture, Mesopotamian Culture, The Coming Dark Age, Stonehenge, Farming, Preservation of knowledge, Architecture, 500 A.D. Avebury Circle, Polarity of Stone, Stone Circle and Hadron Collider Similarities and more.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Stephen Bassett - Pt 7- Official UFO/ET Disclosure
Date: 2010-04-25

Description: We talk about official UFO/ET disclosure with Stephen Bassett from the Paradigm Research Group. Stephen is also behind the upcoming X-Conference in Washington D.C. in May and "Million Fax on Washington" with the intention to bring the UFO/ET question to the Whitehouse and the press. We begin to talk about the Paradigm Research Group, disclosure, some of the evidence for UFO presence, the releasing of UFO documents and files from various countries government, the COMETA report and what true disclosure would mean to mankind and human civilization. Topics Discussed: Ending the Truth Embargo, the Paradigm Research Group inception back in 1996, the UFO issue, UFO Policy, Disclosure Movement, disclosure, technology, propulsion, anti-gravity engine, breakthrough in energy, suppression of knowledge about UFO/ET, After World War II 1947, a National Security issue, Nuclear Arms Race, Nuclear War, Who is out there? Citizens Science Groups, Crop Circles, MUFON, Witness Testimony, Dr Richard Haynes, Pilot and Police reporting database, Releasing of UFO Documents and Files, Releasing of UFO Documents and Files by France, UK, Mexico, Brazil, Sweden, New Zealand and others, COMETA, when will disclosure happen? Truth Embargo Coalition, Public Awareness, How would ET handle Disclosure, Contact of the Third and Fourth Kind, "Taken". Are we ready for disclosure? In hour two for Red Ice Members we talk about who is behind UFO/ET cover-up, is it military, government or other groups? We discuss the ET's interest in nukes. Is here a covert war being waged against the visitors? We talk about defensive weapons, weaponization of space and the "Star Wars program". We ask if it's wise to wait for governments to give us the "true" story of ET when they have been involved in suppression of this information in the past? We also talk about back-engineering and if any covert advanced technology might be responsible for some UFO sightings. How does the UFO question connect with false flag operations? Could a fake alien invasion or an attack be in the plans? We round things up talking about if there are artifacts and bases on Mars, on the Moon and other planets in our solar system. Do we have teleportation technology? How does one relate to this kind of information? We also get Stephen's take on some of the testimony from people like Andrew Basiago and Laura Magdalene Eisenhower who claims they were involved in covert and secret missions to Mars.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Sonia Barrett - Pt 6 - Hacking the Mind & Breaking Reality Codes
Date: 2010-04-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=--XIlVzr03k
Description: Author of The Holographic Canvas, Sonia Barrett returns to Red Ice Radio to talk about some of her latest material on how to hack the mind and break the code of reality. We discuss the human being as a program and the holographic program that is underlying everything. We discuss the recent news about the Croatian girl who woke up from a coma speaking fluent German. How can we re-program our belief about reality and hence change reality? Topics Discussed: Human Beings as Programs, Genetic Programs, The Stage One Human, Soul, Expanded Aspects of ourselves, Collectivism & Oneness, Programmed Reality, Pre-programmed Computer Game Character. What is the Soul? Breaking Reality Codes, The Bible Code, Holographic Design of Reality, Information, Changes, Multiple Lifetimes, Science Limiting Reality, Collective Consciousness, Messiah Figures, Croatian teenager wakes from coma speaking fluent German, the Function of the Brain, Belief System, There is now Distance, Hack our Belief System, Hacking the Mind, Reassessing our beliefs, Control and Chaos, Degrees and Controlling Institutions, Status, Survival, Fear, The Visible, The Many Levels of Experience and Reality, God, The Eye and our Perception. In the next hour with Sonia we will be discussing astrology and the different levels of control and manipulation and how to transcend them. We talk about the planets and the stars, destiny & faith, time & space, perception & belief, the necessity of boundaries, the expiration date of the body or death, age and cycles of Life. We also discuss the evolution of this planet, human civilization, reality decoded by the individual, do we have a soul or are we creating one as we go? Did someone (the creator(s)) make a mistake with Earth? We talk about victim mentality, the reason for death & suffering on the planet and how to manifest your reality with your own will. We end talking about the importance of the will and also how the elite controlling factions have realized how to supplant their will on us and how the key to break it, is simply not to recognize that they have any power over us.

Title: Red Ice TV - Episode 3 - Pt 4/4 - Illuminati Symbolism in Hollywood Movies
Date: 2010-04-25
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ysjFOoOi6Xo
Description: The pyramid and the all-seeing eye. An ancient occult symbol that shows up in religion, churches, Egypt, alchemy, on money, artwork, logos, crop circles, business models, architecture, food, pharma, government and fraternal organizations. Why? This symbol has been a great catalyst for philosophical, religious and political debate. Watch as we trace the pyramid and eye throughout history from Ancient Egypt and Sumer, leading up to the Masons and pop-culture of today. Then, we ask movie goers at the 33rd Gothenburg International Film Festival why this symbol is showing up in Hollywood movies again and again. With all the big film budgets and creative teams available, why the constant use of the pyramid and eye? Let's explore the origins, possible meaning and purpose behind the pyramid and the eye symbolism, for some of us, a symbol we see everyday.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Graham Hancock - Pt 6 - Entangled
Date: 2010-04-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=gO6FXLSJyXM
Description: Join us for a fascinating two-hour program with author Graham Hancock. With books such as "Fingerprints of the Gods", "The Sign and the Seal", "Keeper of Genesis", "Talisman", "Underworld" and "Supernatural" he's become a legend in the field of alternative research. We begin to talk about his latest book Entangled, a novel, and ask why he's chosen to go into the field of fiction, considering his past and excellent non-fiction works. We talk about the advantages of writing fiction. We discuss how Graham's earlier books and research have influenced the writing of Entangled. Topics discussed: Ayahuasca, shamanism, Entangled, why a novel? Academic critics, Underworld, The advantage of writing fiction, the reality behind the story in Entangled, Therianthrope, Anthropos, "Sulpa" & "Illimani", DMT, Supernatural, apocalyptic themes, Rick Strassman, "The Spirit Molecule", quantum physics, the mystery of consciousness, ECG, Plato, soul, near death experience, consciousness, ancestors, cave art, psychedelic plants & substances, the computer, Steve Jobs and LSD, Watson and Crick, knowledge vs. ignorance, violence, fear of death, western civilization, Tibetan book of the dead, Hermes and more. We proceed talking with Graham in hour two for members. We begin to talk about the end, the cyclical nature of civilization and how fragile western society is with its specialization and how intelligence seems to be going down, not up. We talk about inventions of a mind induced by so called vision drugs and various theories on when man first came into contact with psilocybin mushrooms, Amanita Muscaria and Soma. We talk about plants and substances that might have helped to spark the mind of ancient man. We carry the discussion over to the preservation of the shamanic tradition, gnosis, knowledge and we discuss the Gnostics, Cathars, Knights Templar leading into Freemasonry, Rosicrucian's and we get Graham's take on the fruits of these societies and secret societies. What is the destiny of America, "The New Atlantis", who were the founding fathers and what was their intention? We discuss so called "sacred cities" and "sacred faith" and how ancient Egyptian civilization seem to have been supplanted around the world. We talk about alignments of monuments and buildings to the stars in the heaven. We ask if this philosophy can be found in modern times, with cities such as Astana in Kashakztan that have pyramids and spectacular monuments that seem to stem from the same tradition and religious beliefs. We talk about the philosophy of some of the architects and we also get Graham's take on the alien intervention theory of people such as D䮩ken, Zithin, Lloyd Pye and others. Don't miss this exciting second hour.

We ask if this philosophy can be found in modern times, with cities such as Astana in Kashakztan that have pyramids and spectacular monuments that seem to stem from the same tradition and religious beliefs. We talk about the philosophy of some of the architects and we also get Graham's take on the alien intervention theory of people such as D䮩ken, Zithin, Lloyd Pye and others. Don't miss this exciting second hour.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Graham Hancock - Pt 3 - Entangled
Date: 2010-04-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=c0gbCQoLTKY
Description: Join us for a fascinating two-hour program with author Graham Hancock. With books such as "Fingerprints of the Gods", "The Sign and the Seal", "Keeper of Genesis", "Talisman", "Underworld" and "Supernatural" he's become a legend in the field of alternative research. We begin to talk about his latest book Entangled, a novel, and ask why he's chosen to go into the field of fiction, considering his past and excellent non-fiction works. We talk about the advantages of writing fiction. We discuss how Graham's earlier books and research have influenced the writing of Entangled. Topics discussed: Ayahuasca, shamanism, Entangled, why a novel? Academic critics, Underworld, The advantage of writing fiction, the reality behind the story in Entangled, Therianthrope, Anthropos, "Sulpa" & "Illimani", DMT, Supernatural, apocalyptic themes, Rick Strassman, "The Spirit Molecule", quantum physics, the mystery of consciousness, ECG, Plato, soul, near death experience, consciousness, ancestors, cave art, psychedelic plants & substances, the computer, Steve Jobs and LSD, Watson and Crick, knowledge vs. ignorance, violence, fear of death, western civilization, Tibetan book of the dead, Hermes and more. We proceed talking with Graham in hour two for members. We begin to talk about the end, the cyclical nature of civilization and how fragile western society is with its specialization and how intelligence seems to be going down, not up. We talk about inventions of a mind induced by so called vision drugs and various theories on when man first came into contact with psilocybin mushrooms, Amanita Muscaria and Soma. We talk about plants and substances that might have helped to spark the mind of ancient man. We carry the discussion over to the preservation of the shamanic tradition, gnosis, knowledge and we discuss the Gnostics, Cathars, Knights Templar leading into Freemasonry, Rosicrucian's and we get Graham's take on the fruits of these societies and secret societies. What is the destiny of America, "The New Atlantis", who were the founding fathers and what was their intention? We discuss so called "sacred cities" and "sacred faith" and how ancient Egyptian civilization seem to have been supplanted around the world. We talk about alignments of monuments and buildings to the stars in the heaven.

Join us as we discuss her work and research into the Intuition Age, Frequency Change, Dream Interpretation, Speeding up of Time and more. Penney says We're leaving the Information Age and entering the Intuition Age. That means our perception is shifting and the rules of the way life functions are changing.

Description: We spend an hour with Ph. D Michael Noah Mautner, a research professor at the department of chemistry at Virginia Commonwealth University. We recently came across an article on Pysorg.com with the title "We have a 'moral obligation' to seed universe with life" that featured an interview with Michael. So we invited him to talk further about his ideas and research about Panspermia and the seeding of life on other planets. We are now technologically at a point where we have the ability to send microbial life from Earth to other worlds out there in space in order to perpetuate life. The questions is: is this the right thing to do? If so, how would it be done? We also talk about the theory that life on Earth started in this way, someone else seeding life hear, millennia ago. Topics Discussed: Panspermia, Lord Kelvin, Crick, Self Propagation, Genetics, Blue Green Algae, the Question of Origins of Life, Meteorites, Mars, Earth, "Directed Panspermia", Rotifier Eggs, Launch Cost, Calculations, NASA, Solar Screen and more.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Nigel Kerner - Pt 7 - Grey Aliens and the Harvesting of Souls
Date: 2010-03-01
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=FuY7UZcEFS0
Description: Author of "Song of the Greys" and "Grey Aliens and the Harvesting of Souls", Nigel Kerner joins us for an exclusive interview to discuss his books and research on the Greys. In Nigel's 1997 book "Song of the Greys" he first introduced the notion of aliens known as Greys coming to Earth, explaining that Greys are sophisticated biological robots created by an extraterrestrial civilization they have long since outlived. In his new book "Grey Aliens and the Harvesting of Souls" Kerner reveals that the Greys are seeking to master death by obtaining something humans possess that they do not: souls. Through the manipulation of human DNA, these aliens hope to create their own souls and, thereby, escape the entropic grip of the material universe in favor of the timeless realm of spirit. Topics Discussed: Paranormal activity, New Age Teachings, Paranormal experiences, Neigel's son asking about UFO's, Grey's as Biological Robots, Experiments on Humans, Robotic Entities, Abductions, the Source Material, Instructions, Aliens Gathering Information Remotely, "God Burst", Artificial Intelligence, Dominion of Death and more. Join us in our members section with Nigel if you want to hear much more as we proceed to talk about Genetic Engineering, the origin of the Caucasian Race, Albinos and Noah, the Biblical patriarch, as an Albion. Noah's ark, with two of every animal, was part of a big genetic experiment and rebooting life on Earth. We talk about the research of Dr David Jacobs and Budd Hopkins, DNA databases, Heterozygote and Homozygous and advantages when it comes to genetic diversity. We discuss the Nazi's and their Eugenics experiments and the creation of a "New Human", the Aryan Super Race and the Alien race that have been termed the Nordics. Are the Greys are responsible for certain races on this planet? We talk about hidden clues in the Nag Hammadi Library, the bloodline or genetic line of Jesus and the power of will and choice. We also talk more about DNA and genetic programming. Do not miss this exciting two hour program with Nigel Kerner.

Date: 2010-02-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=CqnJtfJv19U
Description: Our friend Freeman returns to Red Ice Radio to talk about the latest strange developments in the ongoing space war. There have been so many developments in this department in the last months, especially up in the north. We recently saw the Norway spiral up in Troms�d aurora light phenomena just a few weeks later. What part did Scandinavia's HAARP facility EISCAT (the European Incoherent Scatter facility) play in all of this? There has also been strange pattern showing up on radar over Australia. Large spherical objects have been seen near the Sun by NASA satellites. We talk about the Cloud of Care, CERN, the LHC, the New Age Messiah Maitreya and much more with Freeman. Do NOT miss these two very exciting hours with Freeman. Topics Discussed: Human Programming, Flash Gordon, Princess Warrior Program, Weather Modification, HAARP, SURA, Norway Spiral, Obama Nobel Peace prize, Cloud of CARE, CERN, New space Program, ARIES, UFOs, 9 19 09, Earthquake in HAITI, Plasma Turbulence, Ring Cloud over Russia, Astana, Maitreya steps forward, G 1.9, U.S. general urges world war on space debris, The New Messiah Maitreya, Benjamin Creme, Space X, Freemasonry, Virgin Galactic's, White Knight one & White Knight Two, Arnold, Obama, ET & CFR, Kodiak Launch pad in Alaska, Vatican, Moon, Designer Babies, GATTACA, Simcores, Mind Transferring Technology, Blue Brain, Avatar, Obelisk and Dome symbolism, Sirius, Alpha-Dranonis, Cleopatra's Needle, 1877, Mars Moon suddenly Visible, Phoboes, Buzz Aldrin says there is a Monolith on Phobos, 2010, July 4th, E.T., Kaaba Stone, "Humanitarian Invasion" of Haiti, Resources on Haiti, UK Military leaving Porta-au-Prince shortly before the Earthquake, Gold, Iridium, Resources and more. Do NOT miss hour two with Freeman as we proceed down the rabbit hole and continue to discuss the latest developments. We talk about the human race being quarantined, are the "Sirians" and or the "Alpha Draconins" trying the break out of the barrier with the technology that they are building? We talk about all the blue stuff that keeps coming up. Like "the Blue Book", the Urantia Book, about the chronology of earth. The book It has some strange origins and contains some really interesting information. We talk about some of it and where it possibly came from. We talk about transferring of the soul into an "e-body", a robot body or a genetically engineered body. Can a soul be sent to another planet? We talk about Avatar and the Navi people in the film and the tarot connection to their name. We talk about the creation of "robo-sapiens" and the hijacking of kids through mind control. We discuss CERN and the new computer grid that they are building there, the Blue Brain project, Blue Gene, kabbalism, A.I. the secret Destiny of America, "going after the guilty", the 9/11 truth movement and how important it is to use your own mind and heart to break away from the programming and mind control techniques that the elite and guiding forces constantly are trying to subject us to. Many people fall to it but there's always an alternative. Don't miss this superb second hour with Freeman.

Date: 2010-02-04
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=9Ae43p00Rk8
Description: Our friend Freeman returns to Red Ice Radio to talk about the latest strange developments in the ongoing space war. There have been so many developments in this department in the last months, especially up in the north. We recently saw the Norway spiral up in Troms�d aurora light phenomena just a few weeks later. What part did Scandinavia's HAARP facility EISCAT (the European Incoherent Scatter facility) play in all of this? There has also been strange pattern showing up on radar over Australia. Large spherical objects have been seen near the Sun by NASA satellites. We talk about the Cloud of Care, CERN, the LHC, the New Age Messiah Maitreya and much more with Freeman. Do NOT miss these two very exciting hours with Freeman. Topics Discussed: Human Programming, Flash Gordon, Princess Warrior Program, Weather Modification, HAARP, SURA, Norway Spiral, Obama Nobel Peace prize, Cloud of CARE, CERN, New space Program, ARIES, UFOs, 9 19 09, Earthquake in HAITI, Plasma Turbulence, Ring Cloud over Russia, Astana, Maitreya steps forward, G 1.9, U.S. general urges world war on space debris, The New Messiah Maitreya, Benjamin Creme, Space X, Freemasonry, Virgin Galactic's, White Knight one & White Knight Two, Arnold, Obama, ET & CFR, Kodiak Launch pad in Alaska, Vatican, Moon, Designer Babies, GATTACA, Simcores, Mind Transferring Technology, Blue Brain, Avatar, Obelisk and Dome symbolism, Sirius, Alpha-Dranonis, Cleopatra's Needle, 1877, Mars Moon suddenly Visible, Phoboes, Buzz Aldrin says there is a Monolith on Phobos, 2010, July 4th, E.T., Kaaba Stone, "Humanitarian Invasion" of Haiti, Resources on Haiti, UK Military leaving Porta-au-Prince shortly before the Earthquake, Gold, Iridium, Resources and more. Do NOT miss hour two with Freeman as we proceed down the rabbit hole and continue to discuss the latest developments. We talk about the human race being quarantined, are the "Sirians" and or the "Alpha Draconins" trying the break out of the barrier with the technology that they are building? We talk about all the blue stuff that keeps coming up. Like "the Blue Book", the Urantia Book, about the chronology of earth. The book It has some strange origins and contains some really interesting information. We talk about some of it and where it possibly came from. We talk about transferring of the soul into an "e-body", a robot body or a genetically engineered body. Can a soul be sent to another planet? We talk about Avatar and the Navi people in the film and the tarot connection to their name. We talk about the creation of "robo-sapiens" and the hijacking of kids through mind control. We discuss CERN and the new computer grid that they are building there, the Blue Brain project, Blue Gene, kabbalism, A.I. the secret Destiny of America, "going after the guilty", the 9/11 truth movement and how important it is to use your own mind and heart to break away from the programming and mind control techniques that the elite and guiding forces constantly are trying to subject us to. Many people fall to it but there's always an alternative. Don't miss this superb second hour with Freeman.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Holger Bech Nielsen - Pt 1 - CERN & the Large Hadron Collider
Date: 2010-02-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=6SYMD3xW_VM
Description: Physicist Holger Bech Nielsen, one of the founders of string theory, joins us from the Neils Bohr Institute in Copenhagen to discuss his theories about CERN, the world's biggest and most expensive physics experiment. We talk about the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the model that they are developing at the Neils Bohr Institute and the search for the mysterious Higgs boson particle, also known as the "god" particle. We ask why the LHC haven't been working properly? We further discuss Holger's claim that he made in an interview with the New York Times that the Large Hadron Collider is being "Sabotaged from the Future". We talk about "god", time, history and the future. Topics discussed: Collision, The Standard Model, Higgs Particle, Superstring Theory, Technicolor, 9 Space Dimensions in String Theory, Kaluza-Klein Particles, Quantum, Einstein, Heisenberg, Newton, Big Bang, "God", Imaginary Part of the Action, Big Bang, Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), Bird dropping a bread crumb in the LHC and more. We continue talking about the mystery of "god", the search for the Higgs boson particle, Gluons, Quarks, Protons and Hadrons with physicist Holger Bech Neilsen in our second hour for Red Ice Members. We continue to talk about the ATLAS detector, the development of string theory, the mystery of quantum mechanics and the wave function collapse. We also talk about time travel, we ask if the future is written in stone? How does free will play into this? We talk about random dynamics and their model. We conclude talking about cosmic rays and the Milky Way black hole as a colossal particle accelerator.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Andrew Johnson - Pt 6 - Chemtrails, Weather Modification & Climate Change
Date: 2010-02-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XJi8xBMIve4
Description: In recent years, the issues of supposed 'Climate Change' and 'Global Warming' have been thrust upon us from all directions. The weather is important to us all, so we should look carefully at the skies, and we should avail ourselves of some facts. Is someone modifying the weather? Can it be true that so many people are blind to something being done in 'plain sight'? Andrew Johnson is behind the website checktheevidence.com and joins us to discuss Chemtrails, weather modification and climate change in our first hour. Topics Discussed: The Origins of the Website, Aircraft Grid, Chemtrails, Contrails, Persistent Jet Trails, Clifford Carnicom, HAARP, Morgellons Disease, Discovery Channel documentary on Chemtrails, Where are the whistleblowers or pilots speaking out? Geo-Engineering, Global Dimming, Weather Modification, FOIA in the UK, Traffic over 15000 feet, Circular Chemtrails, Azores, HAARP, ELF, Tetra System, Energy, Health Effects, EISCAT, Environment Effects, Chemtrails only one part of a bigger program and more. Make sure you join us for a very exciting second hour for Red Ice Members with Andrew Johnson. We begin to talk about weather modification, but we'll take this into another arena pretty quickly and begin to discuss Hurricane Erin and some of the anomalies that happened on the morning of 9/11. This will take us into the area of Directed Energy Weapons - this is where 9/11 research and weather modification connects. Was the World Trade Center buildings destroyed by some kind of Energy Weapon, well we'll discuss some of this evidence with everything from strange bent metal to people reported to have been levitating close by. We talk about Thermite, Controlled Demolition, and the interesting connections of Professor Stephen E. Jones and towards the end we even tie in Crop Circle research and point to the similar effects. You don't want to miss our second hour with Andrew Johnson!

Title: Red Ice Radio - John Lash - Pt 8 - Mystery Religions, Gnosticism, the Occult & the Globalist Elite
Date: 2010-01-11
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1GzFVhIl-7I
Description: Comparative mythologist, author and teacher John Lash returns to the program to discuss "The Mysteries", Religion, Gnosticism, Mystery Schools and the alleged connection to the Globalist Elite. Many different researchers in the alternative research community claim that the elite powers are stepped in the "Mystery religions". They are accused of practicing paganism and occult rituals. Is this true? Is it true paganism? Can this myth be clarified further and can it be defined with more appropriate terminology? Topics Discussed: The Mysteries, The Pagan Mysteries, 415 AD, Friedrich Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Salvationism, The Superman, Gnostics, Deification, Devine Intelligence, Pagan People, Roman Empire, Messiah, Execution of the Gnostics, Etruscans, Human Psychosis, Pathology, The Globalist Game, Serial Killers, Sociopaths, Ted Bundy, Occult Techniques, Subconscious Suggestions, Orchestration of Social Evil, Black Magic, Sophia Myth, the Re-emergence of the Mystery Schools, Theosophist, Organic Light, Counter Magic, Immunity to Resist the Dementia, Shamanism, Psilocybin Mushrooms, Iboga Cult, Voracious, The Expose of the New World Order, Archons, Mind Parasites, Pagans and much more. We continue to talk about the insertion of the idea of the Anti Christ figure into Christianity and what function this might carry on a bigger scale. John poses the question of why the Gnostics or the disciples of the Myth of Sophia, didn't do anything to protect themselves from the persecution and extermination of knowledge. Well, maybe they did in a way and this is related to the idea of the Anti-Christ. We talk about the New World Order and their plans of control to bring the planet under a One World Currency, a One World Government and a One world Religion. We talk more about the One world Religion and the presentation of a Messiah figure in 2012 and who it might be, or at least what it will be coming from. We talk about 2012, why this date if there's nothing to the planetary alignment of the ending of the Mayan Calendar around this time. We talk about Melchizedek, the Bahai Faith and how the plan might unfold. This is a really interesting discussion with some of John's most recent ideas and theories about the immediate future. At the end we also talk about the true name of Gaia and for those who are curious how you'll go about calling out the true name of Gaia.

Title: Red Ice Radio - Sabina DeVita - Pt 7 - Electromagnetic Pollution
Date: 2009-12-15

Description: Electromagnetic Pollution was not a problem a century ago. It has become an occupational hazard of our high-tech 20th century and will probably continue to get worse as technology becomes more and more sophisticated into the 21st century. As our society moves more and more towards wireless forms of communication, the electromagnetic spectrum of broadcast waves is getting more and more crowded with new sources of electromagnetic impulses. We are all walking around being bombarded by a vast array of electromagnetic fields emitted from anything operating on an electrical currant. It's a silent and invisible pollutant. Dr Sabina DeVita is the author "Electromagnetic Pollution - The Silent Invisible Pollutant", she joins us to discuss her work and research. Topics Discussed: Chemical Sensitivities, Nutrition and Behavior, Brain Allergies, Detecting Allergies, Food, Environment, Nutrition and Behavior, ADD, ADHD, Nutrition and Behavior, EMF, Holistic Approach, Milk, Lactose Intolerance, Pasteurization is the Real Problem, Raw Milk, Metabolic Problems, Cell phone radiation, Wi-Fi, Electro Magnetism, George Carlos, Studies on radiation, DNA destroyed, Statistics, Leukemia, Electro magnetism, EMF, Visible Spectrum, radio, microwave, Appliances, Cellphones 2.45 GHz, microwave, Blood Brain Barrier, Cooking the Brain, Cell phone Protectors, Magnetic Fields, Hydro Towers, Hands Free, Ferrite Chokes, Safe Space Deceives, Orgonite. Dr Karim, Geometric Patterns and much more. Joins us in our second hour with Sabina DeVita for much more as we discuss the Swine Flu, Vaccinations, Thimerosol, Mercury, Amalgame, Detoxing, Nutrition and Essential Oils, we talk about a special oil called "Thieves" Oil. It's an interesting name and it has a very interesting story behind that name, going back all the way to the Bubonic Plague and the spice merchants that manage to survive through that time. Not to be missed for those who seek natural remedies and want to stay healthy.

Description: Dr. David M. Jacobs is an associate professor of History at Temple University in Philadelphia specializing in twentieth century American history and culture. He's been a UFO researcher for 45 years. In 1973, he completed his doctoral dissertation in field of intellectual history at the University of Wisconsin--Madison on the controversy over unidentified flying objects in America. This was only the second Ph.D. degree granted involving a UFO-related theme. He joins us for a three-hour discuss about the History of the UFO Phenomena, Abductions, Abduction Reports, The Grey's, the Human-Alien Hybrid Program and the Integration Program. Topics Discussed: Ufology, Fake UFO, 1966, Study the UFO phenomena, Jimmy Carter, All UFO investigation since 1975 just verifies, the occupants of the crafts, Humanoids, The Betty & Barney Hill Case, Evidence for UFOs, Contactee's, Budd Hopkins, Hypnosis, 1986, The Typical Abduction Case, Missing Time, Healing the Traumatized, Channeling, Dissociative, David's first Hypnosis patient, Travis Walton, The Abductions was "assembly line" Nature, Run like a Program, Confabulation and much more. We continue our discussion for about another two hours in our members section and we're just getting started. David unveils his research into the abduction and the human-alien hybrid program. We discuss a few abduction accounts and different theories regarding the situation that seems to be unfolding according to the research of David Jacobs and Budd Hopkins. The "program" is changing and moving towards integration between humans and the hybrids. They are literally moving into our society ....Why? We talk about the alien hierarchy, different races and what the outcome would be if a full integration takes place. How quickly is this happening? It's a very disturbing picture presented, but if true, it's very, very important to know about this. Do NOT miss these three hours!

Description: Dr. David M. Jacobs is an associate professor of History at Temple University in Philadelphia specializing in twentieth century American history and culture. He's been a UFO researcher for 45 years. In 1973, he completed his doctoral dissertation in field of intellectual history at the University of Wisconsin--Madison on the controversy over unidentified flying objects in America. This was only the second Ph.D. degree granted involving a UFO-related theme. He joins us for a three-hour discuss about the History of the UFO Phenomena, Abductions, Abduction Reports, The Grey's, the Human-Alien Hybrid Program and the Integration Program. Topics Discussed: Ufology, Fake UFO, 1966, Study the UFO phenomena, Jimmy Carter, All UFO investigation since 1975 just verifies, the occupants of the crafts, Humanoids, The Betty & Barney Hill Case, Evidence for UFOs, Contactee's, Budd Hopkins, Hypnosis, 1986, The Typical Abduction Case, Missing Time, Healing the Traumatized, Channeling, Dissociative, David's first Hypnosis patient, Travis Walton, The Abductions was "assembly line" Nature, Run like a Program, Confabulation and much more. We continue our discussion for about another two hours in our members section and we're just getting started. David unveils his research into the abduction and the human-alien hybrid program. We discuss a few abduction accounts and different theories regarding the situation that seems to be unfolding according to the research of David Jacobs and Budd Hopkins. The "program" is changing and moving towards integration between humans and the hybrids. They are literally moving into our society ....Why? We talk about the alien hierarchy, different races and what the outcome would be if a full integration takes place. How quickly is this happening? It's a very disturbing picture presented, but if true, it's very, very important to know about this. Do NOT miss these three hours!

We discuss propaganda, media, movie programming and also how the "Evil agenda", strange as it seems, also is causing people to "step up" to their higher potential. We talk about transhumanism and human evolution, the hive mind and the world wide mind. We also discuss the vulcan's, the two opposite, the two fighting sides in the human brain and consciousness. The alien question comes up, have we been invaded with ideas or technology. Is it all a human creation? We discuss advanced human technology not available in the main stream, how technology can help to manipulation people's perception.

Description: Marta Andreasen MEP - Brussels laid Bare, Financial Fraud within the European Union 
September 8, 2009 

We have former European Commission Chief Accountant and current MEP Marta Andreasen with us 
to discuss the fraud and waste within the European Union. 
Marta was suspended from her job by the Commission in May 2002, 
for what they called "failure to show sufficient loyalty and respect". 
The reason for this was that she refused to sign off the 2001 European Commission accounts. 
As an insider of the EU she has shown loyalty and respect to all the peoples of European Union 
by not going along with the EU fraud, waste and corruption and she has helped exposing 
this subject to the public. 
She is the author of "Brussels Laid Bare" and we'll talk about her experiences and the upcoming Lisbon Treaty vote in Ireland and what the outcome will be if it's a Yes or a No. 

Topics Discussed: Marta's Story, Big Reforms, the Collage of Commissioners, Court of Auditors, European Parliament, Funds, How do the Commissioners get their position? 
Marta as Chief Accountant, European Hierarchy, How to Manage the EU Budget, Computer System Problems, Interface Problems, Frauds go Under the Radar more Easily, Political Elite, How the EU treated Marta, Critical Voices within the EU, Supported, Distribution of Wealth, The Economic Situation, What Countries have to Pay for other Countries inside the EU? What is the political agenda of the European Elite? Citizens Initiative, Inter institutional Agreements and much more. Do NOT miss this important program with MEP Marta Andreasen!

Title: Marta Andreasen MEP pt.2 - Financial Fraud within the European Union
Date: 2009-09-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=CA-iMJlOSmM
Description: Marta Andreasen MEP - Brussels laid Bare, Financial Fraud within the European Union 
September 8, 2009 

We have former European Commission Chief Accountant and current MEP Marta Andreasen with us 
to discuss the fraud and waste within the European Union. 
Marta was suspended from her job by the Commission in May 2002, 
for what they called "failure to show sufficient loyalty and respect". 
The reason for this was that she refused to sign off the 2001 European Commission accounts. 
As an insider of the EU she has shown loyalty and respect to all the peoples of European Union 
by not going along with the EU fraud, waste and corruption and she has helped exposing 
this subject to the public. 
She is the author of "Brussels Laid Bare" and we'll talk about her experiences and the upcoming Lisbon Treaty vote in Ireland and what the outcome will be if it's a Yes or a No.

January 7, 2007

We are joined by author and researcher Karen Tate. 
Her latest book is "Sacred Places of Goddess: 108 Destinations".
We begin to talk about Karen's journey into this field and about her book. 
We get into some of the different Goddess traditions around the world and some of the locations or places that are associated with Goddess worship. 
We also get Karen's take on the recent indications that suggest that Hillary Clinton might be running for US president in 2008. We also talk about the Catholic Church and their two Mary's and we touch upon the black Madonna's that can be found in some of the Gothic Cathedrals around Europe.
