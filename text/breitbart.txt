Bray was in Green County, Missouri at the James River Assembly of God where the public would cast votes on Super Tuesday.

The County Clerk Shane Schoeller told Bray he had to leave the property since it was private property.

Bray argued that he was 25 feet away from the door, obliging to the law, but that he shouldn’t have to leave if the premises is being used as a polling site.

Breitbart News reached out to Schoeller for comment, but did not receive a response.

Bray supplied Breitbart News with a photo and videos of the exchange.

Title: By Any Means Necessary
Date: 2015-05-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=nWWyqHj4j9M
Description: During a large rally in front of Baltimore’s City Hall, a young man introduced as “Brother Rose”, in winding and sometimes incoherent speech, praised the burning of a CVS store at the corner of Pennsylvania and North Avenues. “America didn’t care until we started affecting things they profit from…what we saying ‘let’s get you out of our communities.’”

He also said “without us running (unintelligible) Mondawmin Mall [the site of mass looting on Monday], taking back from the stores that have taken our dollars for how long, and not giving back to the community in any type of way. We made a statement. The world heard us then. They heard that the youth of Baltimore are going to get justice by any means necessary.”

He also advocated shutting down restaurants and businesses that were protecting their investments. “If they protected themselves against you, protect yourselves against them. Don’t spend your money there. Don’t give them no reason to be in your neighborhood. Kick them out.”

It was unclear how his plan would allow neighborhood residents to get desperately needed vital goods and services.

Title: Friday Night Fights - Language Warning
Date: 2015-05-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=w_VKuvRqNAk
Description: Baltimore City Hall
Curfew

The organic uprising led by members of the inner city community, which started after Freddie Gray died in the hospital after being apprehended earlier in April, has slowly transitioned to a manufactured uprising, and appears to be coordinated by anarchists and other professional grievance organizations.

While Monday's protests were violent and destructive, once the city imposed a curfew, there was little activity on the streets after 10PM, Tuesday's tear gassing notwithstanding.

Tonight at Baltimore's City Hall, there was a palpable sense of agitation in the crowd around curfew time - a small group of protestors flatly refused to honor the curfew, and were quickly dispatched by police. I personally witnessed six arrests.

As far as I could tell, there were none of Freddie Gray's peers, friends, or neighbors in the crowd that was left after the curfew - rather there were young white anarchists, "students against Israeli apartheid" (who incidentally claimed to have seen police beating on protestors), and other black bloc protestors who were being arrested and defying police.

If the protests and violence continue it will likely be young white kids wearing masks over their faces that you'll see on the television, not inner city Baltimore residents.
