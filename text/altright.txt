Eli Mosley joins Richard, Don and Greg to discuss ISSUE 1) Muh Russia now in its 18th month. Mueller investigation goes after Bannon. Also in Washington: the now-annual ritual speculation about a government-shutdown. ISSUE 2) The CIA hires Chinese people. Yet another Chinese spy caught. Jerry Chun Shing Lee might have been behind Bejing's successful takedown of the CIA's spy-network in China between 2010 and 2012. (starts 35.25) ISSUE 3) James O'Keefe exposes Twatter. Project Veritas reveals that social-media Leviathan Twatter censors people at the behest of Iran, China, and the US. FOX News is surprised. (starts 52.44) ISSUE 4) KAZAKHSTAN DUMPS CYRILLIC! Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev has announced that the Kazakh language will transition from Cyrillic to Latin script by 2025. This move will subject the noble, freedom-loving people of the central Asian steppe to the linguistic influence of ZOG. Save our horse-archer, Neo-Scythian brothers! Write you local Kazakh embassy. Tell them: Latinization is Mongrolization. (starts 1.12.40) ISSUE 5) Russia Insider names the Jew. Web-magazine Russia Insider ran a 5000-word, front-page article announcing that it will henceforth address the JQ frankly. Editor Charles Bausman, the article's author, also endorsed the Alt-Right. What a bold move. Congratulations, Charles! (starts 1.34.00)

From Washington, Alt-Right Politics, America’s most respected mid-week news program. The sharpest minds, realest sources, the most mainstream positions.   This week’s panel:    Richard Spencer, Co-Editor of Alt-Right.com Hannibal Bateman, struggling intellectual. Don Camillo, anti-Gaulist, adventurer. Greg Ritter, fair and balanced moderator   Issue 1: Roy Moore Scores    Accusations have crept up that Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore dated and possibly diddled teenage girls when he was a dashing young lawyer in the 1980s. Roy Moore has flatly denied some allegations, but equivocated on others. In Moore’s words, “If I did, I’m not going to dispute these things, but I don’t remember anything like that.”    Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has now officially thrown Moore under the bus, claiming that he “believes the women” and wants Moore to step aside. This brings into question whether the Republicans would seat Moore even if won. A recent Emerson College poll reveals that Moore still holds a commanding 10-point lead over challenger Doug Jones in a poll taken after the allegations were first levied in the Washington Post.    Will Roy Moore back down, or will he double down?     Issue 2: Based Poles     Sunday, 60,000 people staged a hardcore nationalist rally in Warsaw. The rally marked the anniversary of Poland’s re-emergence as a nation after WWI. It was a fantastic show of clean, healthy patriotism.   Many on the right are well disposed to nations like Poland, who have a nationalistic culture, strong religiosity, relatively high birth-rates, and who adhere to normal gender roles. Other former Eastern Bloc countries exhibit these trends, for example Hungary, the Baltics, the former Yugoslav states, and the Ukraine.    But “based Poland” isn’t what it seems. While its people may be grounded in patriotism, its government is just as ZOGged as any other.   What should our perspective be on nationalistic feeling in the former eastern bloc?   Issue 3: Pestis Negra?   The plague has broken out in Madagascar. It has claimed upwards of 160 lives, and around 2000 have been infected. Ten nearby countries are on high-alert. This plague is remeniscent of 2014’s ebola epidemic.   Madagascar is the world’s fourth largest island. It is home to an eclectic array of plant and animal life, due to the fact that its landmass was most recently connected with what is now India, and not Africa. It was one of the last places on earth to be settled, probably sometime in the first few centuries AD. Moreover, it was not settled by Africans, but rather Polynesian migrants who sailed across the Indian Ocean.    Will the Black Death finally live up to its name?   * * *     Up Against The Paywall    Sign up for AltRight Plus to get bonus segments!      AltRight Plus: Bannon Republic     Steve Bannon is still trying to build a brand.    For much of 2016, the mainstream media and Alt-Right agreed: Steve Bannon was “our guy.” While liberals viewed Bannon as the grim reaper, we overlooked his glaring ideological faults and inconsistencies, viewing him as fellow traveller, or at least someone who connected directly to the rural and suburban White base.    In a recent interview with the New York Times, Bannon claimed that the alt-right is a “media fabrication,” lacking in “meaning and purpose.” He expressed that his “economic nationalist” agenda, which remains vaguely defined, will unite “all people, creeds, and sexual orientations.”     But Bannon isn’t opposed to all ethno-nationalisms, it seems. Tonight he was a speaker at the Zionist Organization Gala, whose abbreviation, is all too telling.   Will Bannon ever get out of our way…

From Washington, Alt-Right Politics, America’s most trusted midweek news program. Panel:  Richard Spencer: President of the National Policy Institute Hannibal Bateman: Director of NPI’s upcoming policy-paper initiativeDon Camillo: NPI’s resident scholar on developing countries Greg Ritter, NPI’s director of logistics    ISSUE 1: New Virginie In Virginia’s gubernatorial election, Democrat Ralph Northam thrashed Republican Ed Gillespie, 56% to 44. Virginia is just the latest victim of browning demographics. The state, formerly a conservative stronghold, has been on a downslide over the last few decades, largely due to Asiatic immigration and the explosive growth of the DC suburbs.   Issue 2: The Saudi Schism  Saudi Arabia is on edge. This week, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman arrested dozens of senior officials and oligarchs, most of whom, coincidentally, were his cousins. The pretense for the arrests was “corruption,” a word which is easy to conflate with “business.” More likely, bin Salman intends to reign in potential political rivals, including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world’s richest men. Bin Talal also bears an uncanny resemblance to Don Corleone.    Issue 3: The Texas Shooting November 5th, a gunman opened fire on a baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The spree killed 26 and wounded 20. Gun control, mental health, all the usual points have been trotted out. These shootings are now de rigeure. The media narratives all presuppose that there is an easy way to prevent them. If we only knew his motives. But what is the fundamental cause of this senseless violence?

ISSUE 3) 100 years since the October Revolution: ???????? ????? ? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ??? ?????????? ???????, ? ?????????? ????????? ????????????? ??????. M?? ??????? ?? ??? ??? ??. What has the “Russian” Revolution wrought? What lessons can we draw from our ideological enemies?
