Title: My Appearance on "Scotland Tonight"
Date: 2017-10-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=b9obmF7ytYM
Description: Scottish TV tentatively throws its hat into the ring of misrepresenting the Alt-Right. In this instance, they associate a cerebral channel like mine with a banned neo-Nazi organisation, then they describe me as both "extreme" and a "white supremacist", then they ostensibly discuss whether nationalist groups should be banned yet spend the entire time demonising nationalist groups, and finally they casually associate the Alt-Right with violence while failing to mention that virtually all of the violence has been started by antifa. It's exactly what you would expect from a little organisation trying to impress bigger organisations.

CORRECTION: At one point I say that the evidence of Scottish Dawn being a continuation of National Action amounts to one guy at a rally saying that he used to be in NA. IN fact, SD had "several" members that were formerly in NA. But... so what?

Description: The second of a trilogy. This was originally titled "Cuckservative Objections", but since I can't tell whether the asker is white (cuck) or coloured (not cuck), I have decided to settle on "civic nationalist". At any rate, that is what his points amount to.

Title: The Alt-Right Are the Response to the SJWs! [reply to Adderly Hanna]

Description: The Skeptics' only answer to the SJWs is more license, more nihilism, and more degeneration, coupled with a lazy and gormless rejection of identity. But they are the response that the SJWs deserve. The Alt-Right is a response to a much grander and more important malaise.

Title: Globalisation vs. the Ethno-state [speech to the Scandza Forum in Oslo]
Date: 2017-07-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3tYqRp9-jww
Description: This speech was given to Scandza's inaugural conference in Norway. Due to unavoidable factors I only had 4 days in which to prepare. With one more day, the speech would have been considerably better. However, the audience seemed to enjoy it, so maybe I'm worrying too much.

NB. Apologies for the audio quality. The clattering sound stops after the first few minutes, but there are intermittent train sounds throughout the video. This is because the weather was very warm that day so we had to have a window open.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=-jlIkGygpI0
Description: "The soul of man does violence to itself, first of all, when it becomes an abscess and, as it were, a tumour on the universe, so far as it can. For to be vexed at anything which happens is a separation of ourselves from nature, in some part of which the natures of all other things are contained. In the next place, the soul does violence to itself when it turns away from any man, or even moves towards him with the intention of injuring, such as are the souls of those who are angry." - Marcus Aurelius

Date: 2017-01-31

Description: Young men, before they develop themselves with skills, life goals and a career, are vulnerable to developing obsessive fixations with women in order to allay their feelings of inadequacy. (This is why it's so important to get young men into fulfilling careers as soon as possible, and why apprenticeships and guilds were such a good idea, and why it is catastrophic that female students now outnumber male students at university.)

NOTE: At the time of filming, I was not aware of the circumstances of the shooting in Seattle. It now seems that the shooter was a right-winger protecting itself from baying leftists. Charges against him have been dropped, presumably because he was found to be acting legitimately in self-defence. Media coverage of the incident has ceased, presumably because it was found to be damaging to the progressive cause.

Title: I Do Not "Advocate Violence" [dealing with Spinosauruskin]
Date: 2016-12-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=CyW-XGe4G08
Description: This clip from the Sargon hangout should clarify things. However, I have realised that, unfortunately, the bit in my original video that Spinosaurus is really sperging out over is not addressed here. This was the bit where I said:

"To say that you want ethno-nationalism, but only if it can be achieved peacefully, is really to say that you don't want ethno-nationalism - because it CANNOT be achieved peacefully in our situation, in our circumstance."

What I am saying here is that violence (by police and/or military) will unfortunately be necessary in the pursuit of my group's survival, much as violence is often necessary throughout the course of history in a group's pursuit of its goals (especially its survival). But instead, Spinosaurus interprets it as my casually "advocating violence" for its own sake, as if it's something that I want. Not at all: this is self-defence, not attack.

He also seems to think that I am advocating normal people go out and attack non-whites. Again, absurd. I am talking about police and military action to protect the native peoples of Europe.

But presumably even that would be too much for Spino. He seems to have no concept of the greater good, and therefore no understanding that the greater good is worth fighting for, and therefore no understanding that fighting is sometimes necessary. He seems to believe that, if something can only be secured by using (some) violence, then it must NOT be secured. This is the very definition of moral cowardice.

He is a typical atomised millennial with no idea about how the world actually works. But what is worse is his disingenuous and obsessive handling of this matter with me. He is a sperg, a coward, a moral coward, and a creepy little shit.

If you want to see him squirm against reality, time and again, then watch this hangout I did with him the other night: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtZs1ndE0HU
The commenters do a good job of highlighting his many evasions, twists, turns and desperate manoeuvres.

What a sperg.

Date: 2016-10-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=BpUrAC-lel8
Description: The killing of Jo Cox MP almost certainly affected the referendum vote a week later. Given how much the powers-that-be stood to gain from her killing, I believe they rigged it.

Title: Fire and Brimstone and Brexit
Date: 2016-10-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=GjpN9FaWXws
Description: As Laurie Penny said, Brexit was a referendum on the modern world. In this (somewhat rushed) series, I will examine various aspects of the story.

NOTE: The first seven episodes of this series were filmed back in July, all in one night. As such, they are of my mid-2016 "uptight" style, and also, I was getting tired by the fifth video. Ideally I would re-film these first seven videos because frankly I am not pleased with them, but there is just too much else that needs to be done.

Title: Peaceful Ethno-Nationalism [reply to Reality Calls]
Date: 2016-10-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NKkbxFXRedc
Description: This is an attempt to lay out the case for why a peaceful recovering of white countries is impossible. There are additional arguments that could have been included but I didn't think of them at the time. I hate to say it, but, if you think this is going to happen peacefully, you are going to be shocked and disappointed over the next 50 years.

EDIT: This video is NOT a recommendation to use violence. It is a prediction that violence, both from whites and from (and between) ethnic minority groups, is simply inevitable, given the circumstances, given human psychology, and given human history.

Description: EDIT: Okay, it seems that I jumped the gun here. It's all to do with a miraculously popular blog called MedievalPOC, which is so popular that its images shoot to the top of Google's search rankings, either direct from the blog or via re-shares on Pinterest etc.

So this was a false alarm on my part. I apologise.

I'm not sure whether to take this video down, though, because it does seem that Google are guilty of this stuff. "American inventors" will get you a slew of black American inventors. "white man white woman" will get you a slew of mixed-race couples, etc. And just today, Google have been caught biasing search results regarding Trump.

At the very least, it would seem to me unwise for Google to source their results from a single website, as they are doing with MedievalPOC.

Title: Cologne and the German Elite
Date: 2016-08-11

Description: I try to characterise the elites of Germany - politicians, the media, the Catholic Church, and the judiciary - in order to explain why so little is being done to protect Germany as a society and the Germans as a people.

This is one of the most difficult videos I have filmed, and it will probably be gruelling to watch. I am sorry about that, but the subject is very depressing.

Mere months after hundreds of German women were sexually assaulted by foreigners, the Archbishop of Cologne stands in a refugee boat on the very spot where it happened, and guilt-trips Germans that they STILL aren't tolerant enough: http://www.dw.com/en/refugee-boat-serves-as-altar-in-cologne/a-19284740

Lamya Kaddor celebrates that the Germans, who welcomed her into their country, are dying out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb9QAUsUA98

The German people are going extinct because they have a fertility rate of less than 1.3, yet instead of incentivising or encouraging them to have more children, their government promotes inter-racial sex: http://newobserveronline.com/german-govt-promotes-interracial-sex/

One extra story I should have included is a workshop teaching migrants how to flirt with German girls. The self-hate on display is almost beyond description: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C--olgLsQE

"The Mayor of London today took action on a pledge made during his election campaign to ban advertisements that could pressurise people to conform to unhealthy or unrealistic body images.

Today Owen has uploaded a triumphant video in which, as Mark Citadel predicted, he turns the focus on to white homophobia and entirely omits any mention of Islam:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ushQCltzvyA

Later in this talk, we discuss whether Islam is merely a codification of a racial animus against Europeans that would be there anyway in Arabs. It turns out that the Orlando shooter specifically asked his hostages their racial background, because "I don't have any problem with the blacks". 4:15 in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMfuNIe33t4

Description: NOTE: I've just realised that many of the British series that I recommend in this video can currently be bought here, on a 40% off sale: http://networkonair.com

Time for something a bit more upbeat. I wanted to wait until the Cologne series was finished before uploading this, but I have failed to film the next video in time, and today is Friday so usually time for a jolly get-together on Google Hangouts, so it seems vaguely appropriate to put up this video instead. It documents the trials and tribulations that I went through in order to free up some space in my room, by way of choosing which of my enormous collection of DVDs to dispose of*. Several people have previewed this video and enjoyed it, and I hope you do, too.

Part 1: 0:00:00
Part 2: 0:05:48
Part 3: 1:26:36
Part 4: 2:45:30

Title: Thread Dissection: Worthless R-Type Maggot
Date: 2016-04-07
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=SpHAou8RnJk
Description: One week after the Cologne story broke, a young Swedish guy (who says that sexist jokes lead eventually to rape and murder) was making jokes about Cologne. The characteristic R-type and feminist, he doesn't really care about women's welfare, he just wants to undermine strong white men. With just a bit of self-examination, he could have avoided making a complete arse of himself. Alas, progressive nihilism thrives precisely by discouraging self-examination.

Title: Millenniyule 2015 Hangout #1 [Sargon of Akkad edition]
Date: 2015-12-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=IY0spEeh_JE
Description: The first of seven Xmas hangouts, with a surprise appearance by Sargon of Akkad (from 1:37:30 onwards).

I had no idea Sargon was going to show up. These Xmas hangouts were/are intended as an end-of-year chill-out thing for *us*, and therefore having ten people in each one is a fine idea. However, having ten people around is a very *bad* idea when there is a huge argument going on. In this case, it became a frantic bitch-fest.

I could probably have moderated better by being more ruthless and simply muting/ejecting people without giving them so many chances. But I have to emphasise, I wasn't mentally or tactically prepared for the kind of debate that this hangout switched to once Sargon arrived. Hence it is, frankly, a fucking disaster.

All the same, I'm sure it makes for quite an interesting listen.

Anyone intrigued by the arguments in this video should perhaps watch this, much more calm, video that I made a few months ago about The Migrant Crisis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm2B7_dOPH8

Title: Reply to /pol/
Date: 2015-12-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=JJLPCeuHoc0
Description: A reply to the comments in a /pol/ thread about me, this video was filmed back in May. Obviously I'd like to have uploaded it at the time, but a huge amount of editing was necessary in order to cut out endless material about "faggotry", "shilling", "degenerate" and so on. Knowing how much work it would be, and that the resulting video wouldn't be tremendous anyway, I have delayed doing it. My apologies.

I warn you that this is *not* a tremendous video. It mainly consists of me replying to charges of faggotry and dealing with the unconquerable conviction among the polacks that I myself started the thread, praising myself. In fact, as is rehearsed many times in the video, I have never, ever, posted on /pol/.

However, that shouldn't be taken as a snide comment about /pol/. As time goes by I have growing affection for it, and this is stated in the video. My "approval" of it has grown more since the filming.

Other beliefs of mine have also changed since the filming, but that will probably be obvious from my statements about them in the video, which are more tame than they would be today.

Watching the video, it is interesting how defensive I am regarding the various accusations and criticisms made of me. Nowadays I would react quite differently. It is interesting what a difference seven months can make.

Incidentally, here is the video where I first talked at length about my gay past, the first "proper" video that I ever put up:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcJNNKCcejE
and I may have also mentioned it here, in the second video I ever put up:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y-1vU2hXDc

The following videos come up in the discussion but they were made private shortly after the filming. I have reviewed them and they are all now available:

"A Young Libertarian vs Islam" (fairly good early one):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5brHnPKOkbs

"Governments and Gumption" (bit of a misfire):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOBLdjXubWc

"The Future of the Anglosphere" (good one, and technically unique - see its description):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgYLIBCKRoY

"A Chain-Smoking, Alcoholic Homosexual" (pretty good one from late last year):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omrcDsVbr4A

Description: A post by Irish shock-journalist Brendan O'Neill - who, to be fair, gets a ridiculous amount of flack from SJWs just for the level of controversy he *does* flaunt - made me think that the truth about white apathy towards non-white victims of terrorism is actually a lot more controversial than the explanation he was giving.

Description: This is an analysis of an email conversation from September 2013 (three months before I began this channel), with an old liberal friend of mine from art college. This is quite a personal video, but I think the experiences will be familiar to a lot of you, and hopefully the intellectual side of it will be of interest as well.

This was filmed back in May when I was coming down with the flu. (I didn't actually know this when I began filming, but it became apparent to me over the 2 hours.) Since the whole thing is indeed over 2 hours long, I have split it up in accordance with the recently-voiced wishes of the viewership, so it is the first multi-parter to go up on the channel.

Unfortunately, I realised after filming this one that there was a piece of fluff caught in my hair! It is present throughout the duration and is quite distracting. I have filmed over 600 videos and nothing like this has happened before. I could film the video a third time, but it has already been delayed enough so instead I have opted to "cover up" the bit of fluff in post-production. I am sorry that the result doesn't look great. It's the best I could do in the time.

Title: [Rotherham: History #1] Olde England
Date: 2015-08-28
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=SwqXg0TlTjs
Description: Surveying the last thousand years and trying to characterise the English people.

One correction: I should have better researched how law was enforced prior to the Enlightenment. There were magistrates ("keepers of the peace") from 1195. Therefore, practical law was not just enforced by the feudal baron and his underlings. However, I don't think this affects the point I was making, that the church was a source of divine "law and order".

Description: A young man in the reactosphere trolled a friend of mine, and it resulted in me making this video for him. He is troubled, confused, frightened and anxious. These are common afflictions among the young, so hopefully the advice in this video will be relevant to other people too.

I'm sorry about that, but technical and personal matters got in the way. 

There will be one more excerpt from the video, and it will be much better than this.

Description: Commentary on this article: http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/03/13/sack-danny-cohen-not-jeremy-clarkson/

I've just realised that the author was James Delingpole. That's unfortunate, because I like Mr Delingpole. I wouldn't want to condemn him as an "intellectual coward" - I expect journalists have to write what their employers will publish.

The point still stands: Breitbart is a race-blind, anti-elitist organisation.

Title: Middle-Class Liberal Swedish Author Craves Beheading
Date: 2015-04-10
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3LVlxjaxdZw
Description: In this postscript to the Hebdo series, I guide the viewer through a sickening monologue by the author Henning Mankell. Topics are Hebdo, immigration, nihilism, weakness, liberals, Europe, the EU, etc.

Note: I don't say much for the first 10 minutes, but after that I just don't shut up.

Note 13/10/15: Mr Mankell died last week. It seems he had terminal cancer when he recorded the monologue. I did not know this at the time. RIP, but his sentiments were still sentiments of weakness, cowardice and self-hate. Whatever his reasons, the rest of us shouldn't emulate him.

For that reason, feminism clearly should be attacked and GamerGate is indeed relevant. Therefore, I do hope that The Sarkeesian Effect is completed and released.

Description: One of my subscribers was kind enough to transcribe this article from an ancient copy of the Daily Mail, a British newspaper. I am sorry it has taken me so long to record the reading of it.

I think this article is an interesting glimpse into the state of the British Empire during WW2, and also, in its author, anticipates today's naive, idealistic, arrogant, privately-educated "international" class, obsessed with equality, streamlining, world government, and the EU.

Title: RIP the Daily Telegraph Blogs
Date: 2014-12-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2lB9tBLX0aY
Description: The Daily Telegraph has (pretty much) shut down its blogs section, which for seven years has been a mainstay of right-wing British discussion on the Internet. It's all part of the paper's push to become PC, even though it had a very good circulation as it was, and will now wither commercially because it has made itself irrelevant. As one commenter put it: "Sad. I've never seen a newspaper commit suicide before."

NB. The unforgivable Dan Hodges incident is here: http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danhodges/100171356/you-want-a-serious-debate-about-immigration-lets-have-one-then/

Title: The Issue of the Century
Date: 2014-09-08
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=b2JCT8nCDoM
Description: This video is not meant to disparage the anti-feminist cause. I am anti-feminism myself and have made many videos, and will upload several more, articulating the case. However, feminism has a death sentence. It is much less important than, and will be wiped out by, a much greater issue facing us this century.

Additionally, I believe that a lot of men are driven to obsess over feminism because it is their way of expressing personal insecurities about women; in that sense their obsession is dishonest as well as pointless. What really brought this home to me was the complete silence among British reactosphere vloggers about the Rotherham scandal, in which they would have learned that 1400 underage white girls were raped by adult Pakistani Muslims. To deem this unworthy of discussion, I believe somebody would have to have a serious personal "issue" with women.

Whatever one's motivation, to focus solely on feminism, when there is a much greater threat looming, is to do an injustice to oneself and to the cause of Western civilisation.

A shorter war, a benign German victory, and ultimately the survival of the British Empire, the preservation of Russia from Communism, and the avoidance of World War 2.

Description: Response to Sandman's video "The Loser Girl" which appears to have been deleted now. This doesn't matter since everything relevant from it is described in this video.

What has feminism/equality achieved? Women's natural instinct to seek help from men has become shallow exploitation, since women don't feel any obligation to return the "favour", ergo they don't limit themselves to men with whom they *want* to return the favour. Meantime, men have been led to believe that women are just as capable as them, and so feel used and exploited when the reality of female neediness enters their lives. In short: neither sex understands the other, or its own obligations, so men and women resent each other pointlessly. Well done, feminism.

Date: 2014-07-05
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XVrOc0fI9tg
Description: Germaine Greer claimed that, as an intellectual, she had no power. I think this is clearly disingenuous. In fact, that she would say such an obviously false thing is symptomatic of the lack of mental rigour in the modern intellectual.

Description: Right-wing ranters often talk about a rather ill-defined thing called "feminised education". I don't doubt them, but I suspect it isn't quite as prevalent or simplistic as they claim. But, I might be completely wrong about this. I'd like to hear about people's own anecdotal experiences of the thing.

Title: Knowing Your Vices
Date: 2014-02-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MZDw0_SSxLg
Description: An extension of The Multimoral Society. This is aimed at people who are not content merely to smoke dope, but also have to wear T-shirts and have bumper stickers extolling the moral virtue of smoking dope. It's as if they don't want the moral responsibility, or the intellectual burden, of admitting that something they enjoy is, nonetheless, a vice. Fundamentally, they have forgotten the distinction between public and private.
