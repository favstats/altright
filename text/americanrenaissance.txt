Title: Who Wants to Abolish the White Race?
Date: 2018-01-12
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_O8ZFBYdl_A
Description: Jared Taylor explains the thinking behind the motto “Abolish the white race.” Theoretically, it’s about abolishing the idea of whiteness, not getting rid of us. But ideas have consequences, and some people are taking the idea literally . . . .

Title: 'Gentrification' or 'White Flight': Whites Can't Win
Date: 2017-11-28

Description: Jared Taylor of American Renaissance reports on recent fracases over “gentrification.” Owners of a coffee shop who say they are “happily gentrifying” a run-down part of Denver were slapped so hard they may have to close. A black woman living in Ingleside, California, says whites were wrong to try to keep the town white 50 years ago, but now that it’s black she wants to keep it black. Whites aren’t welcome. Mr. Taylor explores where this thinking leads.

Description: Jared Taylor of American Renaissance draws parallels between the treatment of Soviet dissidents and American white advocates. The Soviets locked dissidents in mental hospitals because anyone who was blind to the glories of Communism was obviously insane. Race realists who are blind to the glories of “diversity” are also said to have a mental illness called “hate.” Mr. Taylor laughs at the absurdities of PayPal and Twitter campaigns that attempt to silence racial dissidents in the name of “open dialogue” and “creating and sharing ideas.”

Description: Jared Taylor of American Renaissance explains the history of the movement to improve the human race by promoting positive genetic traits and discouraging negative ones. He explains why this approach fell out of favor and the risks we run by ignoring the principles of population genetics. The Chinese are working very hard to apply modern genetics to their population. If they succeed, they could dominate every field of endeavor. Mr. Taylor warns that we can either adopt some of the same techniques or learn Chinese.

Description: Jared Taylor of American Renaissance explains that it is widely accepted that the same techniques that have dramatically improved crops and domestic animals apply to human beings. Amniocentesis, genetic counseling, and screening for donor sperm and eggs all recognizes that genes influence both desirable and undesirable traits. Could these principles be used in a conscious way to improve our species just as we improve race horses and dairy cows?

Title: How to Achieve Racial Separation
Date: 2017-10-03
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=n1z__0Al0BE
Description: Jared Taylor of American Renaissance explains that the only real solution to racial tension is separation. This would mean voluntary separation at the level of neighborhoods, towns, and even states or regions. Impractical as this may seem today, it can be achieved if enough people come to a realistic understanding of the significance of race. Only when different groups go their own ways can they preserve their unique cultures and create societies that suit them best.

Title: How Can We Solve the Race Problem?
Date: 2017-09-26
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ye2tDpgU764
Description: The Black Lives Matter movement is only the latest evidence that blacks aren’t happy living with whites. Blacks seem to have a new grievance with whites each week, and many black thinkers say whites will never get over their “racism.” Jared Taylor of American Renaissance suggests a solution: separation. There would be no more “white supremacy” or “white privilege,” and no blacks would be shot by white police. This solution would also allow whites to survive as a distinct people, and to live in a society that reflects their culture and heritage.

Title: Sam Dickson: “Three Four letter Words: Love, Hate, and Race”
Date: 2017-09-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=P0lp0-WeVBg
Description: The 2013 American Renaissance Conference.

Sam Dickson, a speaker at every American Renaissance conference, speaks on “Three Four-letter Words: Love, Hate, and Race.” He begins by pointing out that when the Southern Poverty Law Center calls American Renaissance a “hate group,” it means only that AR is a group the SPLC itself hates. Far from anything resembling hatred, the desire of whites to pass their civilization down to their biological descendants is the most healthy, natural, and positive of emotions.

Mr. Dickson notes that long-term planning distinguishes successful from unsuccessful people, and argued that the purpose of a group such as ours is to plan for what happens after the inevitable collapse of the present system. The entire paradigm of American society will change, and there must be as many of us as possible in a position to help direct the construction of an ethnostate out of the wreckage.

Mr. Dickson muses on how different our country would be if we had run it for the last 10 years. We would not have squandered trillions on useless wars, nor would we have encouraged the minority-lending housing bubble that so damaged the economy. By avoiding just those two catastrophes, a sensible, racially oriented regime could have saved six trillion dollars.

Mr. Dickson points out that we are not fighting for ideals or abstractions. We are fighting for our people. He speaks admiringly of the French, who build monuments to soldiers who died for "la patrie," the homeland, whereas we build monuments to men we claim died for “freedom” or to “make the world safe for democracy.”

Mr. Dickson also urges us to purge our vocabularies of useless words, such as “conservative” or “right-wing.” To adopt these terms consigns us to a subset of a political spectrum that is irrelevant to our struggle. “We are a race, a folk, a people,” he says, “and a folk is not to be divided into Left and Right.” We can and must unite with all white people on the central subject of race; all other differences are insignificant. A true homeland for our people must be one that cares for our entire family.

Mr. Dickson argues that the founders fumbled badly because they failed to specify who could be an American. The black dictator Dessalines was smarter than Jefferson or Madison when he specified in the Haitian constitution that no white could ever be a citizen or own property. We, too, must act on the same principles and guide ourselves strictly in accordance with what is good for our race.

Title: Fabrice Robert: “Europe Awakes”
Date: 2017-09-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZkDEdvMnZ9I
Description: The 2013 American Renaissance Conference.

Fabrice Robert, the leader of one of the most dynamic nationalist movements in Europe today, the Bloc Identitaire (Identitarian Bloc) here speaks on the awakening of Europe. He points out that traditionally French and Americans have had a prickly relationship but it is different for us: “We agree on a fundamental reality: We are whites, with common problems. We must fight our demographic decline and our substitution in our ancestral lands by Third-World people.”

Mr. Robert says that the identitarian movement was born in 2002. Though it has put up candidates in local elections, its greatest successes have been street actions. The Bloc Identitaire burst into the national headlines in 2003 when it began distributing free food to Paris street people. Most are Arabs and Africans, but the bloc wanted to help needy Frenchmen. It hit upon the idea of distributing pork soup. Pork is cheap and thoroughly French—and considered unclean by Muslims. This put the authorities in such a frenzy that the police actually forbade the distribution of free food! It was “racist” food if Muslims could not eat it.

The bloc has also publicized the fact that parts of Paris and other French cities are taken over by Muslims for prayers. They illegally block traffic, lay rugs in the streets, and turn entire neighborhoods into outdoor mosques. The mainstream press refused to report this, but by filming and publicizing these activities, the bloc persuaded the authorities to stop these illegal takeovers.

The bloc’s most recent success was the occupation of the Poitiers mosque last October. Poitiers is where Charles Martel turned back the Moors in 732 at what Americans call the Battle of Tours. The bloc was outraged to learn that a huge mosque was under construction in a place sacred to the defense of the West. It sent 100 activists to occupy the construction site at 6:00 in the morning. By 9:00 a.m. French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault was already denouncing this “act of racism.” The occupation lasted six hours, raising the bloc’s profile worldwide, and inspiring thousands of new members.

Mr. Robert concludes with these words: “We are sons of the same matrix: Europe. We are brothers of the same people, the European people. There will be no future, for us or for you, unless we stand together proud, united, and prepared to fight.”

Title: Jared Taylor: “Report From the Trenches”
Date: 2017-09-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5-RKLdwaYb0
Description: The 2013 American Renaissance Conference.

Jared Taylor speaks of how the most basic and ancient distinctions between people have been crushed by relentless egalitarianism. He says that the rot began with race, with the assumption that race was superficial and meaningless. However, since then the egalitarian juggernaut has tried to obliterate distinctions between men and women, homosexuals and heterosexuals, welfare spongers and productive tax-payers. Mr. Taylor also mentions Marian Wright Edelman’s denunciation of the need to “distinguish between our own children and other people’s children.” Even the love parents show their children is bigotry because it is a form of discrimination. Mr. Taylor predicts that the next target could be distinctions between citizens and foreigners. After all, we are all citizens of the world, so why not let anyone run for office and vote and American elections?

Thus there are now many subjects—not just race—on which Americans may no longer dissent. Lawrence Summers was forced out of his job as president of Harvard for suggesting that the female and male minds are not identical. School teachers can be put on administrative leave for saying they think men should not marry each other.

We must recognize, says Mr. Taylor, that this is not our country and this is not our government. The federal government, which is engineering our displacement, has become the greatest enemy our people have ever faced. A government that is permitting Mexico slowly to invade and conquer the United States is, by any standard, a government of traitors.

Mr. Taylor emphasizes that we, like all people, have the right to a homeland, but it is probably too late to reclaim the United States. He concludes that we must think in terms of secession and local community-building. There is no guarantee of success, he says, but we have an obligation to our ancestors and a duty to our children to fight to the last breath for the preservation of our people and civilization.

Title: Richard B. Spencer: “Facing the Future as a Minority”
Date: 2017-09-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=yCv7Vaziylc
Description: The 2013 American Renaissance Conference.

Richard Spencer, director of the National Policy Institute, speaks of the need to go beyond the question of immigration that absorbs so much nationalist effort. We have stopped amnesties in the past, but the other side always returns to the fight. And, since a white newborn is already a minority, stopping immigration would only delay our decline into minority status. In any case, not all immigration is bad. We should prepare to welcome the whites who, for example, may well be forced en mass out of southern Africa. Unlike others who talk about immigration in terms of numbers, we talk in terms of quality.

Conventional “conservative” goals are irrelevant to us. What would sound money, limited government, and a return to the Constitution mean if the country were a Third-World mishmash? These goals attract white people and give them the impression that they have a role in shaping the country, but any effort that ignores race is effort wasted. The energy and commitment of these white people must be redirected towards goals that will genuinely serve them.

“Our challenge is one of the spirit,” says Mr. Spencer. “Our task is to capture the imagination of our people or at least the best of our people and shock them out of their assumptions of what they think is possible.” Mr. Spencer notes that for many decent whites the process of letting go of the dream of America will be very painful, but we must dream of a new nation, an ethnostate for our people on this continent. He notes that although the idea may seem fanciful now, the construction of an ethnostate is a modest project compared to crazy federal goals such as narrowing the racial gaps and bringing democracy to the Middle East.

Our ethnostate will be an old-new country that nourishes our roots even as it ensures our future. Mr. Spencer concludes by quoting Theodore Herzl, the father of Zionism: “If you wish it, it is no fairy tale. If you do not wish, it is a fairy tale and will remain so.”

Title: John Derbyshire: “The Great Encounters: When Races First Met”
Date: 2017-09-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=MjGxdSJTdv8
Description: The 2013 American Renaissance Conference.

John Derbyshire, the popular Taki's Magazine and VDare columnist, gives a very informative talk about the first encounters between people of different races. He notes that his was the last generation of Europeans to grow up in a monoracial country—he did not see a black person until he was in his teens.

Most of the first encounters happened before recorded history. Genetic studies now show that at one point Australian aborigines received an infusion of genetic material from Indians who had crossed the ocean. It may well be that lost Japanese fishermen could even have washed up on Australia, but we know nothing of it.

When races encountered each other in historical times, people were invariably struck by physical differences. The Chinese word for whites was “ghost” because Europeans seemed so pale. In one noted encounter, a Japanese described to Chinese the Europeans with whom he was traveling: “Physically they are close to beasts. They cannot speak or write Chinese.”

First encounters sometimes led to race war. During the 1675-1678 King Phillip’s War in Massachusetts, for example, both the English colonists and the Indians fought with the explicit goal of extermination. Mr. Derbyshire notes, however, that the really great wars that have left their marks on history have been intratribal wars: the First and Second World Wars, the American Civil War, the Chinese civil wars.

Mr. Derbyshire concludes by pointing out that we can still have first encounters. In many countries children, especially, may have never seen someone of a different race. He shares the story of an incident in China, in which a small boy stared intently at him as they went up in an elevator. Mr. Derbyshire got out at his floor, and as the doors closed, he heard the child say—in Chinese, of course—”What a big nose.”

Title: RamZPaul: "Sex and Nationalism"
Date: 2017-09-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2byH0o4E9Iw
Description: The 2013 American Renaissance Conference.

RamZPaul is a YouTube blogger who pokes irreverent fun at the foolishness of our times. In this talk, peppered with jokes, he discusses how feminism and multi-racialism contribute to the decline of our country. “We are being replaced and displaced,” he says, and our country has become “a land of the racial spoils system and conflict of all kinds.”

Feminism and the sexual revolution have also brought us unprecedented problems. Now, nearly 60 percent of college students are women. Women still prefer to marry men who are better educated or at least smarter than they, but many of these women will never find a suitable mate and will never have children. At the same time, the sexual revolution now means we have people who suffer from syphilis, gonorrhea, and AIDS–people this presenter calls “incurable romantics.”

Marriage is breaking down, in part because it has become risky for men to marry. If they divorce, they lose their assets and their children. “Marriage is like poker,” he says. “You start out holding hands and end up in financial ruin.” At the same time, as smart women go into careers and become more choosy about their mates, it means that even if they do have children, they have them late in life and have only one or two. It is the dim women, who do not plan ahead, who are proliferating.

Nevertheless, RamZPaul remains optimistic. At least among whites, it is conservatives who are now having more children and the worst of the self-hating liberals may go extinct: “If you hate your race and you hate your sex, why would a white woman want to have sex with you to make more hateful babies?”

RamZPaul reports that more people are speaking out all the time, and that the PC folk are desperate. So many people are now “haters” and “racists” that the words hardly mean anything. “The country is lost, but the nation is still there,” and the nation could reassert itself with surprising force and speed.

Title: Byron Roth: “Offshoring, Mass Immigration, and Wage Stagnation: Why Education is No Solution
Date: 2017-09-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=_Bfx8VAb2Pc
Description: The 2013 American Renaissance Conference.

Byron Roth is professor emeritus of psychology at Dowling College and author of "The Perils of Diversity: Immigration and Human Nature." His presentation covers the complex tangle of misfortunes that have befallen the white working-class. He notes that before the Second World War, a man did not have to have much education to get a job that could support a family. Farm, factory, and other low-skilled work was abundant and well paid.

Prof. Roth argues that there are three main reasons why things have changed dramatically. One, of course, is the influx of low-skilled immigrants who put downward pressure on wages. The second is the offshoring of jobs, which has the practical effect of making Americans compete in the labor market with people who live on twenty dollars a day. The third is the opening of markets to products from Third-World countries, which has exactly the same effect. Prof. Roth points out that the results of these policies—low wages and cheap foreign goods—benefit the elites but are a callous betrayal of unskilled Americans.

The Left always argues that “education” will lift the working class into the middle class, but Prof. Roth shows that this is a delusion. This theory fails to recognize that there are inherent differences in ability that mean certain people simply cannot benefit very much from additional education.

Forty percent of all high school students are now black or Hispanic, and many cannot absorb education past the seventh or eighth grade. Prof. Roth argued that they would be much better served by vocational training, but that would be impossible in America: classes of that kind would be largely non-white, resulting in cries of “discrimination” and “institutional racism.” In a homogeneous society, it is much easier to track students into instruction suitable to their ability.

Prof. Roth shows how racial differences in average IQ are an almost perfect predictor of how much people from different groups will achieve in school and in professional life. People with IQs below 80 cannot really handle a high school curriculum and people with IQs under 105 do not benefit from a four-year college. Yet, we have a tremendously powerful education lobby that persuades young people to waste years and to go deeply into debt for training that will do little practical good.

Prof. Roth notes that all societies must provide for their less able members, but that the combination of free trade, open borders, off-shoring, and the fraud of “college for all” proves that “our elites have lost any sense of noblesse oblige.”

Title: Roger McGrath: “The Warrior Heroes of Our Tribe ”
Date: 2017-09-16
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XD8gZVkelCA
Description: The 2013 American Renaissance Conference.

Roger McGrath, a retired history professor, noted television commentator and author of "Gunfighters, Highwaymen, & Vigilantes" speaks on the importance of honoring our heritage. “I was instinctively proud of our people when I was growing up in California,” he says. “The Golden State really was the Golden State. We must pass on to our descendants this pride in our people, our culture, our history.”

He speaks here of the devotion and courage of the American pilots who fought the Japanese in the Pacific. He cites many names of heroes, among them Butch O’Hare after whom the Chicago Airport is named. Early in the war, O’Hare was flying a Wildcat, a plane distinctly inferior to the Japanese Zero. He was the only pilot in the sky when nine Japanese bombers attacked the carrier Lexington. O’Hare shot down five bombers and damaged a sixth before other American planes finally arrived to protect the ship. O’Hare saved the Lexington and thousands of men single-handedly.

O’Hare was later awarded the Medal of Honor and reporters asked his wife what she thought of her hero husband. In words that captured the spirit of the times, and show how much we have changed, she replied, “I think he’s just swell.”

Professor McGrath also speaks on the Doolittle Raiders, of “Pappy” Boyington, and the men who carried out the precision attack that brought down the architect of the Pearl Harbor attack, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. These and many others, he says, are fit heroes for our tribe, men whose bravery can be a model for our own behavior.

Title: Martin Lichtmesz: "Nationalist Movements in Austria and Germany"
Date: 2017-08-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3zg1z5i2ycs
Description: The 2017 American Renaissance Conference: "Turning the Tide."

Martin Lichtmesz of the German New Right paints a comprehensive picture of rising nationalist movements in Austria and Germany. He notes that, just as in the United States, Europe is so divided that some say it is in a state of “pre-Civil War.” Indeed, some leftists welcome civil war, in the hope that globalists will crush nationalists and establish a “Republic of Europe.”

It is in opposition to this nightmare vision that nationalist, patriotic movements have arisen in the German-speaking world: PEGIDA, Alternative fur Deutchland, the Austrian Freedom Party, etc. All such groups speak in the name of “the people” or “the folk” because the people have been betrayed by their rulers. PEGIDA’s slogan was nothing less than “We are the people.” This terrifies the elites because, as Mr. Lightmesz notes, “there is nothing they hate more than the concept of folk, the idea of a people united.” Angela Merkel has tried to defuse this idea by claiming that, in Germany, “‘the people’ is everyone who lives in this country.”

Some of these movements have been started by people with little political or organizational experience, and have collapsed. However, nationalists are learning from their mistakes, and Identitarians have emerged as the best-led and best-organized patriotic movements.

They have specialized in highly photogenic “pranks” such as hanging giant, patriotic banners from the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin or occupying mosques. Their moving video, “A Declaration of War,” became a YouTube sensation and has inspired activists around the world.

Mr. Lichtmesz concludes with a ringing declaration of the need for all Europeans to set aside the petty nationalisms of the past and to unite in defense of their common civilization.

Title: Jared Taylor - "Has the White Man Turned the Corner?"
Date: 2017-08-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5ZzP2Hp_B-Q
Description: The 2017 American Renaissance Conference: "Turning the Tide."

Jared Taylor begins by saying that during his first 25 years of white advocacy, there was so little progress he sometimes felt he was just leaving a record. As the great Frenchman Guillaume Faye said 17 years ago, “There are some things that must be said so that future generations will know that at least some of us were aware, and that our generation was not entirely composed of cowards and fools.”

“Things are different now,” says Mr. Taylor, “We have a real, fighting chance.” He compares the conflict between globalism and identitarianism to the grinding together of tectonic plates. “And you know happens when plates collide: earthquakes.”

“Egalitarianism is in crisis,” Mr. Taylor says, and in a crisis, foolish people do what they have always done—only more desperately. He gives many examples of increasingly outrageous egalitarian measures, noting that more and more white Americans mock their absurdity. He contrasted this with the energy and creativity of the movement represented by the people at the conference.

Mr. Taylor says he takes inspiration from Eastern European regimes, where heads of state and elected leaders “are just one step short of saying explicitly that Europe must remain white.” He notes that there have been disappointing election results in Western Europe, but adds that “this means only that it will be a long fight.” He ends on a martial note: “We are in a battle for our lives. We are all soldiers in this titanic battle. And we will win!”

Title: John Derbyshire: "Does Race Denialism Have a Future?"
Date: 2017-08-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=vybuyVVsyG0
Description: The 2017 American Renaissance Conference: "Turning the Tide."

John Derbyshire presents a broad, insightful history of the tension between race realism and race denialism. Earlier generations were much wiser than ours. What Mr. Derbyshire calls the “long 19th century”—the period from 1776 to 1914—was one of unsystematized but also undeceived observation of human differences, and an instinctive grasp of the power of heredity. It also saw the gradual acceptance of evolution as the cause of group differences. After the First World War, advances in genetics, psychometrics, and sociobiology led to an increasingly scientific understanding of the three main traits that distinguish both individuals and groups: Behavior, Intelligence, and Personality, or what Mr. Derbyshire calls BIP. It is now unquestionable that all aspects of BIP are significantly influenced by genes.

Unfortunately, there has been a catastrophic retreat from both science and common sense. Ours is an era of what Mr. Derbyshire calls “race denialism,” in which “all observed group differences are said to be superficial, and all statistical differences are said to be caused by historical and social circumstance.” Because deniers still hold power, race realists are waging guerrilla war for the truth.

One tactic is to uncover and publicize “hate facts,” or “things that are demonstrably true but that we are not supposed to talk about.”
It would be comforting to think that science will prevail, but Mr. Derbyshire warns that “scientific thinking is very unnatural.” Most people never get beyond emotion, or even belief in magic, and are adept at ignoring anything that undercuts their beliefs. Mr. Derbyshire notes that the West has already moved on to “sex denialism.” “If you can deny sex differences,” he asks, “what human trait can you not deny?” Denialists are like the White Queen in Through the Looking Glass: “Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”

Title: Sam Dickson: "Through a Glass Darkly"
Date: 2017-08-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=8DaaJDWjCqo
Description: The 2017 American Renaissance Conference: "Turning the Tide."

Sam Dickson speaks of what will come after the collapse of the current egalitarian order.

Quoting the Bible, he says we see only “through a glass darkly” because we can never know history’s next turn—but history can be our guide. He gives examples of historical turning points, including the genocide of the Armenians as the Ottoman Empire collapsed. Christian Armenians had lived patiently under Islamic rule, tolerating small injustices and moderate oppression. This assured survival until the First World War upset the equilibrium, and racial/religious tensions exploded into massacre.

White Americans are like the Armenians of a century ago. We have long tolerated crime and held our tongues in the face of hostile media and politicians. But as the whites in South Africa discovered, a sudden escalation of racial animus can threaten a people’s survival. The 2016 election gave us a hint of this. Violence against Trump supporters, calls for violence against Trump himself, and the blasé media response to this are signs of dangers ahead.

“There will be a collapse at some point,” Mr. Dickson says. It could come from military overreach, financial ruin, race war, or any combination of these. He adds that the collapse “does not have to be a bloody affair; it does not have to be dramatic.” He expresses the hope that it will be like the peaceful partition of the USSR rather than the American Civil War. He concludes by noting that with a future certain to be both uncertain and turbulent, we must be prepared for anything, but must keep our eyes fixed on the goal of securing a homeland for our people.

Title: 2017 AmRen Conference: "Reports from the Field"
Date: 2017-08-09

Description: The 2017 American Renaissance Conference: "Turning the Tide."

Several “reports from the field” are given by prominent figures in our movement. Nathan Damigo speaks about his youth organization, Identity Evropa, which from modest beginnings has rapidly grown to more than 700 members. It has attracted national attention for its activism on college campuses and elsewhere.

Richard Spencer speaks about his new website, AltRight.com, and his plans to publish several major subversive books in the coming months. He also describes the alliances he has been building with other movement groups, and announces a National Policy Institute conference.

Daniel Friberg speaks about the increasingly indispensable alt-right publishing house, Arktos Media, and displays a graph showing dramatic annual increases in sales. His publishing house has been the first to translate many vital European thinkers into English.

Finally, Simon Roche speaks eloquently of the dire situation in South Africa and how his organization, Suidlanders, is preparing for the real possibility of civil war. “We are not leaving the land that has been our home since April 6, 1652,” he says to enthusiastic applause.

Title: Julian Langness: "Millennial Red-Pilling and the Future of Europe"
Date: 2017-08-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Yth2k2SbROY
Description: The 2017 American Renaissance Conference: "Turning the Tide."

Author Julian Langness gives an insightful analysis of how the dynamics of generational change will overthrow the globalist order. He notes that his generation—millennials—were “raised with a sort of nothingness: No loyalty to family, nation, God . . . nothing. We were taught indifference, if not shame towards our ancestors.”

For millennials, the challenge is to reject nothingness. To shake off the blinders is “to exchange porn for procreation, student debt for meme warfare, video games for the shooting range, and Vicodin for the red pill.” The real counterculture, he notes, is now on the Right. The Left is stuck in the futile conformity of “social justice,” while we are bursting with energy and creativity. “If the ideology uniting all these people were anything other than what it is [racial identity], this new counterculture would be on the front page of every major newspaper,” he says.

Mr. Langness predicts that as baby boomers die off, there will be a political vacuum, and “millennials will take the reins of power by default.” The meme warfare his generation has perfected is opening the eyes of countless disillusioned young whites who will use their power to further explicitly racial goals. Nevertheless, Mr. Langness does not envisage an electoral solution; with “turbulence on the horizon” we must be ready for anything. “Shopping mall multiculturalism pushes our racial tensions beneath the surface,” he says, but at any time “it could bust forth—as it did overnight after Hurricane Katrina.”

Title: Peter Brimelow: "The Trump Report Card—So Far"
Date: 2017-08-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ETfG8F7PpW0
Description: The 2017 American Renaissance Conference: "Turning the Tide."

Peter Brimelow, founder and editor of VDARE.com, notes that “Whatever one thinks of Donald Trump, he gets a full ‘A’ simply for not being Hillary Clinton.” President Clinton “would have gone full Merkel:” open borders, refugees en masse, more executive amnesties, and new horrors on the Supreme Court. Instead of Neil Gorsuch, we would have had another Sonia Sotomayor, and if the Court can find same-sex marriage in the Constitution, it can find anything. A President Clinton would surely have pushed for hate-speech laws and draconian gun control.

Mr. Brimelow makes no excuses for Donald Trump’s shortcomings, however. He notes how erratic and egotistical he is, but points out that unlike a prime minister in a parliamentary system, he has limited power. “Trump is like electing King Kong,” he says. “You pull back the curtain and there he is—roaring.”

Mr. Brimelow predicts that “there’s a huge showdown coming.” Mr. Trump not only managed a hostile takeover of the GOP, but is now locked in a contest for power with “the entire state, the literal government.” Impeachment—successful or not—could be the climax of this battle. Mr. Brimelow speculates that “Trump didn’t overturn DACA because he knows the courts will do it for him”—a practical if somewhat cowardly approach. “I do think he will build the wall” he adds, “though the wall is mostly symbolic. What I care about is enforcement.”

Mr. Brimelow notes that “in September, Trump gets to set the number of refugees we will take in. He should set it to zero—except for white South Africans.”

Title: Helmuth Nyborg: "What Made Europe Great & What Could Destroy It"
Date: 2017-08-09
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=02vvYDxXQ3w
Description: The 2017 American Renaissance Conference: "Turning the Tide."

Helmuth Nyborg, professor emeritus of the University of Aarhus, begins by pointing out the clear relationship between distance from the equator and both brain size and intelligence. At or close to the equator, the average IQ is 69, whereas at a latitude of 54 degrees the average is 98. Prof. Nyborg observes that races could be logically be classified as “eco-types,” since their traits reflect the ecological niches in which they evolved.

Prof. Nyborg also notes that unlike the north/south gradient in IQ there is no East/West gradient, virtually proving that it is the challenges of a cold climate that have forced northern peoples to evolve higher intelligence and a greater capacity for cooperation. He points out that Arabs have lower-than-expected IQs relative to the latitudes in which they evolved, probably due to the dysgenic effects of frequent cousin marriages.

Two forces could destroy Western Civilization. One is a social system that taxes the competent to subsidize the proliferation of the incompetent. As Prof. Nyborg notes, “The welfare-state debases what created high civilization in the first place. This is the first time in history that the less fit are reproducing more than the more fit.”

At the same time, lower-IQ non-Europeans are pouring into the continent, bringing with them alien practices and religions. Prof. Nyborg concludes with a warning: Unless Europeans are able to reverse these two trends, “the result could be the undoing of the Enlightenment. We may be on the precipice of a new Dark Age.”

Description: Jared Taylor of American Renaissance explains how every "equal-rights" movement from abolition to gay marriage has hijacked Thomas Jefferson's words from the Declaration of Independence. He shows that the phrase was meant to justify independence from England, not to give women the vote or promote mass immigration. He notes that federal judges, Ho Chi Minh, and even Chinese college students borrow Jefferson's words to promote ideas Jefferson would have thought were preposterous.

Title: Institutional Racism: Another Sorry Excuse
Date: 2017-06-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=t5JAqUq02n8
Description: Jared Taylor of American Renaissance tries to understand the concept of "institutional racism." Racism is said to be what holds back blacks and whites in American society, but there just don't seem to be enough racist people or deliberately racist practices to explain large gaps in achievement. The culprit must therefore be institutions, or the structure of society. Jared Taylor shows why this explanation makes no sense, and explains what the real problem is.

Description: Jared Taylor of American Renaissance describes the racial thinking of the Founding Fathers and of other great Americans. Since colonial times and until the mid-20th century, Americans had a vivid sense of the significance of race, and took it for granted that the United States must always be firmly rooted in Europe. Mr. Taylor warns that today's egalitarian, multicultural orthodoxies are a dangerous departure from the more thoughtful views that shaped our country.

Description: A recent article in Huffington Post South Africa proposed a solution to global inequality: disfranchise white men. It argued that since most of the wealth of white men is "the result of theft and violence," women and non-whites should pass laws to take it back. Jared Taylor of American Renaissance explains how absurd this is, noting that the discoveries of achievements of whites have enriched the entire world. It is those who have contributed the least, and benefited the most from Western science and technology who most resent whites.

URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=UJaGYcVFIVY
Description: Jared Taylor of American Renaissance dissects the slogan: "We are a nation of immigrants." It is not true and never was, and it is illogical to think of it as a justification for policy. Liberals would never justify any other policy by arguing "that's the way it's always been." Liberals also misuse "E pluribus unum," the motto on the Great Seal, falsely claiming that it celebrates immigration. Together, these mottoes are used as anti-white weapons to justify the immigration that is reducing the American founding stock to a minority.

Immigrants are supposed to have come legally and be in the US for five years before they go on welfare, but Hispanic immigrants get food handouts at four times the white rate. Mr. Taylor discusses these and other stark disparities in welfare use.

He points out that Indians slaughtered each other over land long before whites arrived, but no one says they had no right to defend territory just because they took it from someone else. All around the world, people live on land they took from others but--so long as they are not white--no one says they have no rights to them.

Any gathering of blacks—for any reason—is a potential riot, and black riots are always dangerous for whites. Blacks riots are an expression of hatred for whites, and riots are cover for looting.

Title: The Truth About the Milwaukee Riots
Date: 2016-08-17
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZILczN5BVsQ
Description: Jared Taylor of American Renaissance explains the causes and consequences of the 2016 Milwaukee riots. Blacks rioted over a police killing even when the officer who did the shooting was black. They burned down businesses even though the officer's body cam shows he was facing a man with a gun.

It could not be clearer that the problem is not police “racism” or judicial system bias. It's about the miseries blacks bring upon themselves--and inflict on each other--but blame on whites. We are already hearing the usual excuses: systemic racism, white oppression, lack of black "access" to the "abundance" whites enjoy.

“This is a problem the United States can’t solve,” says Jared Taylor. “It’s a race problem, in a country that thinks there’s no such thing as race.” Blindness to reality only means more anti-white hatred, crime, and--of course--more riots.

Date: 2016-07-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=hiGDvph6D4Y
Description: Jared Taylor of American Renaissance explains how Donald Trump can win in November: He must increase white voter turnout as well as the percentage of whites who vote GOP.

The whites who are least likely to vote are poor and do not have college degrees, but they will benefit the most from Mr. Trump's policies. In order to get these voters to the polls, Mr. Trump should condemn "Black Lives Matter" and "affirmative action," which is discrimination against whites.

If Mr Trump also sticks to his signature issues of immigration control, "fair trade," and the war against cops, he will get enough white votes to win.

Mr. Trump should stay away from standard GOP issues such as abortion, gay marriage, and other religious issues because they only divide whites.

RamZPaul describes the activists of the Alt Right as young, brash, offensive, and effective, in their attacks on what they call the “cuckservative” Right. They are united in their frank acceptance of race as the basis for any healthy nation or civilization, but they also recognize sex differences, are skeptical of democracy, suspicious of “free trade,” and contemptuous of the idea of “nation building” overseas. He concludes with one of the iconic videos of the Alt Right.

Mr. Kaalep speaks of the 12,000-year history of the Estonian people, and explains that they have survived “because we fought invaders one after another until none is left.” Survival is not a matter of luck, he says, but of struggle. “You must be willing to put yourself at risk,” he says, “but not for abstract principles. Your sacrifice must be for your people.”

Mr. Kaalep speaks of his work organizing torch-light rallies to commemorate Estonian independence. Europeans, he concludes, must bury their old rivalries and defend their continent together. The flames of their torches are the hope of Europe, a Europe of homelands, in which the roots of each people will sink deep and nourish rich and everlasting identities.

Description: Afrikaner author and activist Dan Roodt addresses the 2016 American Renaissance conference. He describes his people as the canaries in the coal mine. They are whites who have given up power to a non-white majority, and their fate signals what is in store if other white groups lose majority status.

Dr. Roodt explains that, despite the overwhelming prejudice his people face, Afrikaners might have a better future in South Africa than elsewhere in the Western world. They are reviving their distinctive culture and crowds spontaneously break into the old, apartheid national anthem, “Die Stem.” “There could be a crisis,” he said, “and we could take back the parts of the country that matter and once again fly our old orange, white and blue flag.” “The canary in the mine is not dead,” he said. “He is working,” chipping away at the rock face.

Title: Jared Taylor: "Why They Lie"
Date: 2016-05-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=XRJE2gRtD1A
Description: Jared Taylor, editor of American Renaissance, speaks at the organization's 2016 conference about the lies that whites tell each other about race. He discusses the police cover-ups in Cologne, Germany, and across Britain, where police hid the truth about immigrant sex assaults. He describes how scientists openly express their willingness to suppress the truth about race differences in intelligence and points out that "the whole Black Lives Matter movement is a pack of lies." This does not, however, stop white academics from writing about how police “hunt down and target blacks” as part of a “race war.”

Mr. Taylor reminds the audience of great battles their ancestors fought for their survival: Marathon, Poitiers, Vienna, the siege of Malta, Blood River. “You have the blood of heroes in your veins,” he says. “You know your duty. And I know you will do it.”

Date: 2016-05-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5zY-ILwwpZ0
Description: Filip Dewinter, a member of the European Parliament for the Vlaams Belang, gives a stirring call for the defense of Europe at the 2016 American Renaissance conference. He warns that "uncontrolled immigration is replacing indigenous populations" and that inaction will lead to "a tsunami of pauperized Third-World immigrants" pushing their way into Europe. “Islam,” says Mr. Dewinter, "is the ancient hereditary enemy of Europe,” quoting many Muslim leaders who call openly for turning Europe into a Muslim continent. He adds that because Europeans have been weakened and denatured by multi-culti foolishness, "Europe is on the verge of extinction." The only solution, says Mr. Dewinter, is for "the West to regain its fighting spirit, to start a civilizational moral offensive, based on the foundations of our greatness."

Title: Fernando Cortés: "Massive Mexican Immigration—a Business of Crooks"
Date: 2016-05-27
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=uQaIEnQz6RY
Description: Fernando Cortés, a long-time Mexican nationalist and identitarian, offers his perspective on immigration to the United States at the 2016 American Renaissance conference. He argues that the Mexican regime could be accused of almost intentional mismanagement of the economy so as to keep Mexicans poor and provide cheap labor for Americans. Mr. Cortés acknowledges the damage that massive Mexican immigration does to American identity, and says that, at the same time, the present system is bad for Mexico, which loses important workers, even as corruption and civil decay creep north. He speaks of his happiness in finding identitarians in America because, "for me, the US is Mordor—the only place where the ring can be destroyed." We will always be neighbors, he says, and “two nations can live side by side with true, separate identities.” However, this can be successful only when “each nation has its own folk, territory, and independence.”

He recounts his decision to become a pro-white radio host in 2004 and the unfair media treatment he has since received. He describes his interactions with the Trump campaign and the ensuing smear campaign that resulted. Finally, Mr. Edwards says the risks of activism are far less than many imagine. "I have never lost a friend," he says. "It has enlarged my circle of friends. I would go to war for them and they would go to war for me." His advice? "Get involved in any way you can.

Description: Jared Taylor of American Renaissance explains why racial profiling--which is illegal--is no different from age or sex profiling, both of which are legal. To ask police to pretend that blacks are no more likely than whites to commit crime is like asking them to pretend that 17 year olds are no more likely than 70 year olds to commit crime.

Taylor cites government statistics to show that there is no evidence of systemic bias in policing or in the justice system. The facts leave no doubt that people of different races commit crime at sharply different rates, and that interracial violence is overwhelmingly black-on-white.

Title: Race and Drug Arrests: Another Big Lie
Date: 2015-02-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3fkZUrT7t4o
Description: Are blacks more likely to be arrested for drug offenses despite using drugs at the same rates as whites? Conventional wisdom has it that the war on drugs is inherently discriminatory, but a closer look at black crime statistics undermines explanations that rely exclusively on racial bias or police discrimination. Jared Taylor, editor of American Renaissance, discusses several empirical studies that support a more nuanced understanding of differential arrest rates for drug-related crimes, one that avoids the pitfalls of the typically reductive explanations that emphasize systemic anti-black discrimination by a hopelessly racist police force.
