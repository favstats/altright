Title: Who Are We?

Who Are You?

I'm not talking about your name or occupation.

I'm talking about something bigger, something deeper. I'm talking about your connection to a culture, a history, a destiny. An identity that stretches back—and flows forwards—for centuries . . . an identity you can glimpse in the face of a grandparent, or your child . . . An identity you know through experience . . . through people . . . through places . . . through music.

Our ancestors had a strong sense of their identities. They could say: I'm a Roman . . . a Saxon . . . a Dane . . . Some could say I'm a European. To be exiled from their communities and identities was a fate worse than death.
Today, we seem to have no idea who we are . . . We’re rootless . . . We've become wanderers . . . perhaps, we'll also become seekers.

Who are we?

We are often told that being an American—or a Briton or German or any European nationality—is about being dedicated to a collection of abstractions and buzzwords: democracy . . . freedom . . . tolerance . . . multiculturalism . . .

But a nation based on "freedom" is just another place to go shopping. It's a country for everyone . . . and thus a country for no one . . . it's a country in which we ourselves have become strangers.
Man doesn't live, and man doesn't die, for abstractions like "freedom." Man lives and dies for a homeland . . . for a people and its future . . . for beauty . . . for the power of being part of something bigger than one's self . . .

Who are we? We must cut to root of it.

We aren't just “White.” "White" is a checkbox on a census form. We are part of the peoples, history, spirit, and civilization of Europe. This legacy stands before us as a gift . . . and a challenge.

For what our ancestors took for granted, we must discover and we must renew.

Some might say that our task is impossible. That we're swimming against the tide . . . going against the grain . . . living against the time. And we are.

But nothing necessary is impossible.

So long as we avoid and deny our identity—at a time when every other people is asserting its own—we will have no chance to resist our dispossession . . . no chance to find another horizon . . .

So now the real question is, are you ready to become who we are!?

Title: "The Eagle Caste" (Ode to the Alt-right) Video played at NPI conference in Washington DC 11 19 16
Date: 2016-11-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=d4urwmEzzDo
Description: "The Eagle Caste" (Ode to the Alt-right) by Mark Brahmin

Played at NPI Conference 11/19/16

So here we are at last,
As telling events grow nigh.
Eagles are a reclusive caste,
Each preferring a separate sky,
Yet here reluctantly massed,

For dire things have grown,
Heights we once commanded,
Are by enemies overthrown,
Whilst servility demanded,
By hidden foes now known,

Between us much is decided,
Scales fallen from our eyes,
Our true men no longer divided,
As all now see clearly the lies,
And laugh at the petty-prided,

And so I am not here,
To tell you what you know,
In to truth, we already peer,
Nor to make numbers grow,
Nature is more gifted I fear,

Awoken by liars and thieves,
Men slowly make their return,
As spring brings forth leaves,
And onto winter’s brow concern,
Of a fate which destiny weaves,

And to those still unconvinced,
The enemies, fools and the weak,
These words were not evinced,
To such men I no longer speak
For words are no longer minced.

It is only for you my words form,
Aye it is only for you my brother,
Only to he whom to truth conform,
for why should I talk to another,
about miracles only we perform?

Great friends ready to aid,
Yet always without risk or loss,
All those who remain unswayed,
Beauty, wealth its great cost,
All these things soon will fade,

And then only a name will last,
And a meaning with it that grows,
"Where was he in our dark past?"
"Was he enriching himself with foes?"
Or flying among the Eagle Caste,

Men who for their people fought,
Only from these kings descend,
Here a love of kin was untaught,
Thus we ensure this love not end,
Or a king's love ever bought,

Thus do always what you should,
Consider no longer "when?"
But in all moments rise for good,
Be among the heroes of men,
Be recalled as one who stood.

Description: "Ode to Son" by Mark Brahmin

Music by Xurious

Event video at NPI Conference 11/19/ 16.

Aye, to you I bestow this life,
You, my beloved, precious son,
life obtained through greatest strife,
And with it all my victories won,

To you this heirloom is imparted,
All that is good and all that is true,
Only you continue what I started,
All of which was started for you,

Aye, it was for you that I created,
It was for you I dared to last,
It was for you I loved or hated.
It was for you that I surpassed.

And yet this life that I sowed,
This path that I have showed,
And by greatest toil bestowed,
Is, yes, also to your father owed.

My blood in which your genius is found,
You are called upon this to defend,
But by no other chain are you bound,
If only you live always to this end.

Yet as you are by me possessed,
So also me you likewise possess
And with a power unguessed,
Which enemies tremble to assess.

For this greatness feel never shame,
Unless its power has gone to waste,
For this greatness accept never blame
For survival is upon greatness based.

And never believe in fated decline,
Or that all things must turn to sand,
For you are the sun, not the vine,
The seasons: at your command.

Title: Donald Trump: Only the Beginning
Date: 2016-11-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=5hZvTpT7r0A
Description: “This election will determine whether we are a free nation, or whether we have only the illusion of democracy, but are, in fact, controlled by a small handful of global special interests, rigging the system. . . . The establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are very well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a “sexist,” a “racist,” a “xenophobe,” and morally deformed. . . . They will attack. They will slander you. they will seek to destroy your career and your family. They will seek to destroy everything about you including your reputation.

This is a struggle for the survival of our nation.

~Donald J. Trump

No matter what happens in November, we must fight for the survival of our people and civilization.

This is only the beginning.
