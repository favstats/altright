Really, although I disagree with a lot of things she's said/done, she's not an evil person or anything and she doesn't deserve all the trolling she gets.
Also, although I talk about welfare in this video, this is NOT meant to be an argument for or against welfare. This is purely a discussion of how welfare should be handled in its current state.

In this week's Weekly Rundown, we cover Canada's new Bill 89, which would allow the government to remove children from their parents' custody under grounds of "gender identity and gender expression" issues. I don't mean to sound pessimistic, but I think Canada is lost to SJW totalitarianism.

Like a lot of you, the oppression olympics happening at the Evergreen College student protests really got to me. So in this video, we look at whether people of color (which is SJW talk for non-white people), specifically black people, are systematically oppressed in our society by examining incarceration, income and education rates.

Title: What's My Gender?? | The SJW Gender Tag
Date: 2017-05-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=CQhe5BjTBNU
Description: In this video, I do the Gender Tag that has been going around the SJW community! Looking at the tag, it seems to me like social justice warriors and feminists have a very different approach to the question of "What is gender?" Instead of focusing on social norms and constructs, they seem to favor an a definition that emphasizes identity, pronouns expression, dysphoria and personal experience.

My views on the issue have changed a lot over time, and still continue to change, and I'm not trying to change anyone's mind with this video, just to open up the conversation a bit.

This isn't about veganism as a concept, but rather the way some adherents act toward those who aren't vegan.

Title: Why I'm Not A Feminist | Women Against Feminism
Date: 2016-12-13
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=B7onZE83hM8
Description: One of the questions I get asked most as an anti-SJW woman is why I'm not a feminist. I don't hate all feminists, but in my opinion, third wave feminism is currently having a very negative impact on women, families, and society.

Title: Should We Trust the Media? | Biased Journalism & Creative Reporting
Date: 2016-12-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=GldzvWK9P80
Description: In this video we’re going to look at media bias, and the way that journalists use omission and creative reporting (including source manipulation) in order to shape the public discourse and push certain narratives. Like many people, I had always assumed

Tl;dr If you ask me, you probably shouldn’t believe everything you see on the news.

Side note: This video uses Hillary Clinton’s campaign as an example of the bias and corruption in journalism, and it is a critique media collusion, not Clinton’s campaign specifically. That would be a whole different video.

Title: What is the Alt-Right? | Nationalism, Race & Supremacy
Date: 2016-11-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=ViF-uz9JOZI
Description: What is the alt-right? Some people have called them neo-Nazis, white supremacists, fascists, etc., but there’s not really any one solid definition of who the alt-right are and what they believe. In this video I try to explain the differences within the alt-right movement, as although all alt-righters usually espouse some form of western nationalism, what that means exactly varies from person to person.

In my opinion, the varying degrees of extremism from alt-right people relate to their adherence to pro-white nationalism, racial determinism (HBD), the desire for racially homogenous societies, white supremacy, and antisematism.

DISCLAIMER
I am not alt-right. The things I am discussing in this video are NOT my own views. Seriously. Not alt-right.

Title: Should We Listen & Believe? | Dealing with Allegations
Date: 2016-11-21
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=9b1vT2tlIzU
Description: As we all remember, one of the biggest scandals to come out during this election cycle were all the women who made allegations of harassment against Donald Trump. 

That whole controversy, and the lack of evidence to substantiate the claims of misconduct, made me think of the "listen and believe" mentality that feminists and social justice warriors often try to promote.

If you ask me, the kind of behavior Trump was accused of is inexcusable, but it doesn't change the fact that all people are innocent until proven guilty.

Pretty much, if you're at a university, you can assume that PC culture is going to dominate :)

Title: John Oliver Wants YOU to Take in Syrian Refugees! | Debunking Last Week Tonight
Date: 2016-10-23
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=NF8k4rIJ82k
Description: This video debunks some of the claims made by John Oliver made about the Syrian Refugee Crisis and migrants in Europe on his show Last Week Tonight. Basically, there’s a lot he left out, including the economic effects of mass low-skilled immigration (huge government spending on social benefits) and the potential safety concerns. I still think he’s a funny guy though.

Title: Should We Raise the Minimum Wage? | Poverty & Unemployment
Date: 2016-10-14
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=1IiJBGvLZnw
Description: No watermark? Clear audio? IS THIS EVEN A ROAMING VIDEO???
But seriously, thank you to all my amazing patrons and everyone who donated to my Paypal account. Also a ridiculous heap of gratitude to Vrbatim, who sent me my fancy new mic :)
These upgrades have made a huge difference, and they’re all thanks to you guys!

This video examines whether we should raise the minimum wage by looking at its effects on poverty, unemployment and costs for consumers. It also looks at how high minimum wages affect small businesses and big corporations differently in terms of their ability to automate. There are emotional arguments to be made for the minimum wage, but I think focusing on economics is more useful.

Title: 7 Things You Should Know About Black Lives Matter
Date: 2016-09-29
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=2FwLhc2NSQ0
Description: This is the first video in a new series I'm starting called "Things You Should Know!" Each video in the series will present 5-10 facts about a different topic, and I'll probably make one of these every 2 months or so. The internet seems to love lists, so I'm pretty much trying to get in on that cash cow hehe ;)

This looks at Black Lives Matter's anti-white racism, anti-police attitudes, tendency toward rioting, and their connection to the Movement for Black Lives.

Also, it pains my OCD deeply that this video's thumbnail doesn't match the others on my channel, but I really liked the way it looked so I decided to keep it. But whatever, I'm pretty sure no one reads these description things anyway. Still sick too, so sorry if I sound mumbly/like Brian Johnson.

Title: Can Black People Be Racist? Can Women Be Sexist? | Power + Prejudice
Date: 2016-09-16

Description: This video looks at the concept of "power plus prejudice," and the question of whether black people can be racist (reverse racism) and women can be sexist (reverse sexism).

Sorry Kat Blaque, but in my opinion anyone can be racist, not just white people, and anyone can be sexist, not just men.

Title: Hate Speech or Free Speech? | The Dangers of Censorship
Date: 2016-09-02
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=xKNo1Ay1n38
Description: This video is about the debate between hate speech and freedom of speech, and why I think free speech is so important. I wanted to address this topic because one of my favorite commentators, Milo Yannopoulos, has been banned from Twitter and continually faces censorship on university campuses just for having views similar to my own.

As a freedom of speech absolutist, I disapprove of censorship, even censorship of offensive material such as hate speech (not that Milo actually engages in hate speech). I think people who advocate hate speech bans, like those we see in Germany and in safe spaces, may be doing so with the right intentions, but I don’t believe in limiting human rights, regardless of whether it protects people’s feelings.

I would have also liked to go into the ongoing YouTube demonetization thing, but that’s sort of its own problem since YouTube isn’t technically censoring people, they just disincentivizing the creation of controversial content. I’m still against what they’re doing, but it’s a more complicated issue than outright censorship.

Also I have a sore throat, so sorry that my voice sounds scratchy

Title: "HANDS OFF MY CULTURE!" | The Myth of Cultural Appropriation
Date: 2016-08-19
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=Vh7c7PSVubE
Description: If you thought the thumbnail was offensive, you're not going to like this video.

These are my general thoughts on cultural appropriation, and I know this topic is a really sensitive one. There's way more that could be said about it than can fit into a seven minute video, but here are the main reasons why I don't believe that cultural appropriation is a major problem like some people like to paint it as.

Long story short, I think what people need to keep in mind is that offence is taken, not given. Just because you might be offended by something (like a Halloween costume), it doesn't mean it's inherently offensive to everyone. Segregating cultures will never lead to more unity in society, which is what we really need right now.

Shout out to my girls Laci Green and Franchesca Ramsey, and to MTV in general. Without them, I would have nothing to make videos about.

Title: A Different Gender Every Day? | The Gender Fluid Issue
Date: 2016-08-06
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=x5mlNZ6J7Ck
Description: This video takes a look at some of the issues that stem from identifying as gender fluid, genderqueer, non-binary, or whatever it is the kids are calling it these days. It explores the relationship between masculinity, femininity, and gender, gender as a binary, and the use of gender-neutral pronouns like ze and hir.

Disclaimer: This video pokes fun at SJWs and tumblr-ites, but isn't in reference to anyone who actually experiences gender dysphoria.

Thanks for watching! And if you liked this, you can also check out my other video on gender:

Title: Paul Ryan's "Racist" Selfie? | My Experience as His Intern
Date: 2016-07-20
URL: http://youtube.com/watch?v=3NaIbC4sgrY
Description: Some of the interns (but apparently not many of them) in Paul Ryan's "Speaker selfie" were actually Democrats, but a lot of people are painting this as a specifically Republican issue. #GOPsowhite #Internssowhite

I'm pretty clearly frustrated in this video, but that's just because I hate how much race baiting there's been in pop culture lately. And I don't even like talking about partisan issues, because I think policies are more important than party affiliation, but this whole selfie thing was bugging me way too much to ignore.

Also, I know I'm definitely not good at filming myself! The lighting is worse than I thought and my phone kept falling over... But my next video will be a normal presentation-style one, another one about gender!

Description: In this video, I explore the history of feminism and the differences between each of its three waves.
